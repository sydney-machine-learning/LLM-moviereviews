The Shawshank Redemption,tt0111161,1995,Oscar," If I didn't care  More than words can say  If I didn't care  Would I feel this way?  If this isn't love  Then why do I thrill?  And what makes my headgo round and round  While my heart stands still?  If I didn't care  Would it be the same?  Would my every prayer begin and end  With just your name?  And would I be sure  That this is love beyond compare?  Would all this be true  If I didn't care for you? Mr. Dufresne,describe the confrontation you hadwith your wife the night she was murdered.It was very bitter.She said she was glad I knew,that she hated all the sneaking around...And she said...she wanted a divorce in Reno.What was your response?I told her I would not grant one.""I'll see you in hellbefore I see you in Reno.""Those were the words you used,Mr. Dufresne, according to your neighbors.If they say so. I really don'tremember. I was upset.What happened after youargued with your wife?She packed a bag.She packed a bag to goand stay with... Mr. Quentin.Glenn Quentin.A golf pro at theSnowdon Hills Country Club.The man you discoveredwas your wife's lover.Did you follow her?I went to a few bars first.Later, I...drove to his house to confront them.They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,and waited.With what intention?I'm not sure.I was confused.Drunk.I think... mostly,I wanted to scare them.When they arrived, you went upto the house and murdered them.No. I was sobering up.I got back in the car,and I drove home to sleep it off.Along the way, I stopped,and I threw my gun into the Royal River.I feel I've been very clear on this point.Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaningwoman shows up the following morningand finds your wife in bed with herlover, riddled with . caliber bullets.Now, does that strike you as a fantasticcoincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?Yes, it does.Yet you still maintain that you threw your guninto the river before the murders took place. That's very convenient. It's the truth.The police dragged that river forthree days, and nary a gun was found.So, there could be no comparisonmade between your gunand the bullets taken fromthe bloodstained corpses of the victims.And that also... is very convenient.Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,I find it decidedly inconvenientthat the gun was never found. And would I be sure that this  Is love beyond compare... Ladies and gentlemen, you've heardall the evidence. you know all the facts.We have the accused atthe scene of the crime.We have footprints, tire tracks,bullets strewn on the ground which bearhis fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,likewise with fingerprints.And most of all,we have a beautiful youngwoman and her loverlying dead in each other's arms.They... had sinned.But was their crime so greatas to merit a death sentence?Now, while you think about that......think about this.A revolver holds six bullets.Not eight.I submit that this was nota hotblooded crime of passion.That at least could beunderstood, if not condoned.No. This was revenge...of a much more brutal andcoldblooded nature. Consider this.Four bullets per victim.Not six shots fired, but eight.That means that he fired the gun empty,and then stopped to reload......so that he could shoot each of them again.An extra bullet per lover.Right in the head.You strike me as a particularly icyand remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.It chills my blood just to look at you.By the power vested in meby the state of Maine,I hereby order you to serve twolife sentences, back to back.One for each of your victims. So be it.Sit.We see by your file you've served years of a life sentence.Yes, sir.You feel you've been rehabilitated?Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.I mean, I learned my lesson.I can honestly say... I'm a changed man.I'm no longer a danger to society.That's God's honest truth.Hey, Red. How'd it go?Same old shit. Different day.Yeah. I know how you feel.I'm up for rejection next week.Yeah, I got rejected last week.It happens.Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?You've had five packs already. Four. Five.There must be a con like mein every prison in America.I'm the guy who can get it for you.Cigarettes, a bag of reefer...if that's your thing...a bottle of brandy to celebrateyour kid's highschool graduation.Damn near anything, within reason.Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in and asked me to smuggle RitaHayworth into the prison for him,I told him, ""No problem.""Andy came to Shawshank Prisonin early , for murdering his wifeand the fella she was banging.On the outside he had beenvicepresident of a large Portland bank.Good work for a man as young as he was.Hey, Red.Do you speak English, butt steak?You follow this officer.I haven't seen such a sorrylookingheap of mmmaggot shit in all my life.Hey, fish! Come over here.Come on, fish.Taking bets today, Red?Smokes or coins? Better's choice. Smokes. Put me down for two. All right. Who's your horse?That little sack of shit... eighth...eighth from the front. He'll be first.All bullshit. I'll take that action. Yeah, me too. You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.I'll take... ttthe chubby fatass there.The fifth one from the front.Put me down for a quarter deck.Fresh fish!Fresh fish today!We're reeling them in!I must admit, I didn't think muchof Andy, first time I laid eyes on him.Looked like a stiff breezewould blow him over.That was my first impression of the man.What do you say, Red?That tall drink of water withthe silver spoon up his ass. That guy? Never happen. Ten cigarettes.That's a rich bet.All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?Heywood? Jigger?Skeet?Floyd?Four brave souls.Return to your cellblocks for evening count.All prisoners return to your cell blocks.Turn to the right. Eyes front.This is Mr. Hadley. He'sCaptain of the Guards.I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.You are convicted felons.That's why they've sent you to me.Rule number one:No blasphemy.I'll not have the Lord's nametaken in vain in my prison.The other rules...you'll figure out as you go along.Any questions?When do we eat?You eat when we say you eat!You shit when we say you shit,and you piss when we say you piss.You got that, you maggotdick motherfucker?Aarghh!On your feet.I believe in two things.Discipline and the Bible.Here you'll receive both.Put your trust in the Lord.Your ass belongs to me.Welcome to Shawshank.Unhook 'em.Turn around.That's enough.Move to the end of the cage.Turn around.Delouse him.Turn around.Move out of the cage, go left.Pick up your clothes and Bible.Next man up.To the right. Right, right, right.Left, left...The first night's the toughest.No doubt about it.They march you in,naked as the day you were born,skin burning and halfblind from thatdelousing shit they throw on you.And when they put you in that cell,and those bars slam home...that's when you know it's for real.Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.Nothing left, but all the timein the world to think about it.Most new fish come closeto madness the first night.Somebody always breaks down crying.Happens every time.The only question is:Who's it gonna be?It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.I had my money on Andy Dufresne.Lights out!I remember my first night.Seems like a long time ago.Yoohoo!Hey, fish.Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy. Boy, are you scared of the dark? You like it here, new fish?You'll wish your daddynever dicked your mommy.Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!You taking this down, new fish?There's gonna be a quiz later! Poke your ass out, give me a first look! Shh! Keep it down.The boys always go fishingwith firsttimers.And they don't quittill they reel someone in.Hey, Fat Ass.Fat Ass.Talk to me, boy.I know you're there.I can hear you breathing.Don't you listen to these nitwits.You hear me?This place ain't so bad.I tell you what.I'll introduce you around.Make you feel right at home.I know a couple of big old bull queersthat would just love tomake your acquaintance.Especially that big, white,mmushy butt of yours.God!I don't belong here!We have a winner!I wanna go home!And it's Fat Ass by a nose!Hey, it's the fat guy!It's the fat guy!Fresh fish!Fresh fish! Fresh fish!I don't belong here!Fresh fish!I wanna go home. I want my mommy.I had your mother.She wasn't that great.Fresh fish!What the Christ is this happy horse shit?He took the Lord's name in vain.I'm telling the Warden.You'll be telling himwith my baton up your ass!You got to let me out of here!What is your malfunction,you fat barrel of monkey spunk?Please...I ain't supposed to be here.Not me!I ain't gonna count to three,I'm not even gonna count to one.You'll shut the fuck upor I'll sing you a lullaby!Shut up, man. Shut up.There's been a mistake!You don't understand.I'm not supposed to be here!Open that cell.Me neither. You people runthis place like a fucking prison!Son of a bitch.Take it easy.If I hear so much as a mousefart in here the rest of the night,I swear by God and sonny Jesus,you will all visit the infirmary.Every last motherfucker in here.Call the trustees.Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.His first night in the joint, AndyDufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.He never made a sound. Tier  North. Clear. Tier  South. Clear. Tier  South. Clear. Tier  North... Tier  South. Clear. Tier  South. Clear.Prepare to roll out.Roll out!Are... Are you going to eat that?I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.Do you mind?Ah... that's nice and ripe.Jake says thank you.Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.I'm going to look after himuntil he's big enough to fly.Oh, no, no. Here he comes.Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?Come on. Set 'em down.I want 'em all lined up here,just like a pretty little chorus line.Yeah, look at that! Look at that. I can't stand this guy. Oh, Lord!Yes. Richmond, Virginia. Smell my ass! After he smells mine.Gee, Red, it was a terrible shameabout your horse coming in last, an' all.But I sure do love that winninghorse of mine, though.I believe, I owe that boy a great big,sloppy kiss when I see him.Why don't you give him someof your cigarettes, instead?Lucky fuck.Hey, Tyrell.You pull infirmary duty this week? How's that horse of mine doing, anyway? Dead.Hadley busted his head up pretty good.The doc had already gone home for the night.Poor bastard lay there till this morning.By then, hell, there weren'tnothing we could do.What was his name?What did you say?I was just wondering ifanyone knew his name.What the fuck do you care, new fish?It doesn't fuckin' matter whathis name was. He's dead.Hey...Anybody come at you yet?Anybody get to you yet?Hey, we all need friends in here.I could be a friend to you.Hey...Hard to get.I like that.Andy kept prettymuch to himself at first.I guess he had a lot on his mind,trying to adapt to life on the inside.It wasn't until a month went bythat he opened his mouth...to say more than two words to somebody.As it turned out...that somebody was me.Officers Russell and Burwellreport to the duty officer.I'm Andy Dufresne.The wifekilling banker.Why did you do it?I didn't, since you ask.You're gonna fit right in!Everybody in here's innocent.Didn't you know that? Heywood, what are you in here for? Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.You think your shit smellssweeter than most. Is that right? What do you think? To tell you the truth,I haven't made up my mind.I understand you're a manthat knows how to get things.I'm known to locate certainthings, from time to time. I wonder if you might get mea rock hammer.  A what?A rock hammer. What is it, and why? What do you care?Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn'ta question, I'd just quote a price,but then a toothbrush isa nonlethal object, isn't it?Fair enough.A rock hammer is aboutsix or seven inches long. Looks like a miniature pickax. Pickax? For rocks. Rocks.Quartz?Quartz.And some mica.Shale.Limestone.So?So, I'm a rock hound.At least, I was in my old life.I'd like to be again on a limited basis.Or maybe you wantto hammer somebody's skull.No, sir.I have no enemies here.No? Wait a while.Word gets around.The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.Especially Bogs.I don't suppose it would help anyif I explained to them I'm not homosexual.Neither are they.You have to be human first.They don't qualify.Bull queers take by force.It's all they want or understand.If I were you, I'd grow eyesin the back of my head.Thanks for the advice.Well, that's free.You understand my concern.Well, if there's any trouble,I won't use the hammer, OK?Then I guess you want to escape.Tunnel under the wall, maybe.Did I miss something? What's funny?You'll understand whenyou see the rock hammer. What's an item like this usually go for? Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.My normal markup's  per cent.But this is a specialty item.The risk goes up, the price goes up.Let's make it an even ten bucks.Ten it is.Waste of money, if you ask me.Why's that?Folks around this jointlove surprise inspections.If they find it, you're gonna lose it.If they do catch you with it,you don't know me.You mention my name, wenever do business again.Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.Now, you got that?I understand.Thank you...Mr. er...? Red. The name's Red. Red?Why do they call you that?Maybe it's because I'm Irish.I could see why some ofthe boys took him for snobby.He had a quiet way about him.A walk and a talk, that justwasn't normal around here.He strolled...like a man in a park, withouta care or worry in the world.Like he had on an invisible coatthat would shield him from this place.Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.Let's go!Some of us have got a schedule to keep.Move it! Come on. Move it!Bob, how are you doing?How's the wife treating you?Easy.Keep it moving.Red...Andy was right.I finally got the joke.It would take a man about  yearsto tunnel under the wall with one of these. Book? Not today. Book? No.Hey, Brooksy.Delivery for Dufresne.Book?... book?Dufresne...Here's your book.Thanks.Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.Get on back and fetch us up some.If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.Honey... hush.That's it. You fight.It's better that way.I wish I could tell youthat Andy fought the good fight,and the Sisters let him be.I wish I could tell you that.But prison is no fairytale world.He never said who did it.But we all knew.Things went on like that for a while.Prison life consists of routine...and then more routine.Every so often, Andy wouldshow up with fresh bruises.The Sisters kept at him.Sometimes he was able tofight 'em off. Sometimes not.And that's how it went for Andy.That was his routine.I do believe those first twoyears were the worst for him.And I also believe,if things had gone on that way, thisplace would have got the best of him.But then, in the spring of ,the powers that be decided that...The roof of the licenseplatefactory needs resurfacing.I need a dozenvolunteers for a week's work.As you know,special detail carrieswith it special privileges.It was outdoor detail......and May is one damn finemonth to be working outdoors.Stay in line there.More than a hundred menvolunteered for the job.Wallace E Unger.Ellis Redding.Wouldn't you know it?Me and some fellows I knowwere among the names called.Andrew Dufresne.It only cost us a packof smokes per man.I made my usual  per cent, of course.So, this bigshot lawyercalls me longdistance from Texas.I say, ""Yeah?""He says, ""Sorry to inform you,but your brother just died."" Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm not. He was an asshole.Ran off years ago.Figured him for dead, anyway.So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,""Your brother died a rich man."" Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks A million bucks?Fucking incredible howlucky some assholes get.JeezLouise! Are you gonna see any of that?,. That's what he left me. Dollars? Yeah.Holy shit! That's great.That's like winning the sweepstakes.Isn't it?Dumb shit. What do you thinkthe government's gonna do to me?Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?Crying shame.Some people really got it awful!Andy, are you nuts?Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!Well, you'll pay some tax,but you'll still end up...Oh, yeah, yeah.Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?I've got to pay tax on the car.Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids pesteringme to take them for a ride all the time...And at the end of the year, you figure the taxwrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.I tell you... Uncle Sam!He puts his hand in your shirtand squeezes your tit till it's purple. Andy! Andy! What's he doing? Getting himself killed. Keep tarring.Some brother! Shit.Hey!Mr. Hadley...do you trust your wife?Oh, that's funny.You're gonna look funniersucking my dick with no teeth.I mean, do you think she'd go behindyour back, try to hamstring you?That's it. Step aside, Mert.This fucker's having an accident.He's gonna push him off the roof.Cos if you do trust her, there'sno reason you can't keep that ,. What did you say? ,. ,? All of it. All of it? Every penny.You'd better start making sense.If you want to keep the money,give it to your wife.The IRS allows a onetimeonly giftto your spouse for up to $,. Bullshit! Taxfree? Taxfree. The IRS can't touch one cent.You're the smart banker whatkilled his wife, aren't you.Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So I can end up in here with you? It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS.They'll say the same thing.Actually I feel stupid telling you this.I'm sure you would haveinvestigated the on matter yourself.Yeah, I don't need no smart banker to tell mewhere the bears shit in the buckwheat.Of course not, but you do needsomeone to set up the taxfree gift for you. It'll cost you. A lawyer, for example. A bunch of ballwashing bastards.Alright.I suppose I could set it up for you.That would save you some money.If you get the forms, I'll preparethem for you. Nearly free of charge.I'd only ask three beers apiecefor each of my coworkers.Coworkers! Get him!That's rich, ain't it?I think a man working outdoorsfeels more like a man,...if he can have a bottle of suds.That's only my opinion... sir.What are you jimmies staring at?Back to work!Let's go. Work.And that's how it came to pass...that on the secondtolast day of the job,the convict crew that tarred theplatefactory roof in the spring of '...wound up sitting in a rowat ten o'clock in the morning,drinking icycold, Bohemiastyle beer...courtesy of the hardest screw that everwalked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.Drink up while it's cold, ladies.The colossal prick evenmanaged to sound magnanimous.We sat and drank with the sun onour shoulders, and felt like free men.Hell, we could have been tarring the roofof one of our own houses.We were the lords of all creation.As for Andy, he spent thatbreak hunkered in the shade...a strange little smile on his face,watching us drink his beer.Hey...Want a cold one, Andy?No, thanks.I gave up drinking.You could argue he'd doneit to curry favor with the guards.Or maybe make afew friends among us cons.Me, I think he did itjust to feel normal again.If only for a short while.King me. Chess. Now, there's a game of kings. What?Civilized, strategic.And a total fucking mystery.I hate it.Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.Yeah. Sure.I thought of getting a board together.Well, I'm the right man.I'm the guy that can get things.We might do business on a board.but I want to carve the pieces myself.One side in alabaster, the opposing sidein soapstone. What do you think? I think it'll take years. Well, years I got.What I don't have are the rocks.Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.Pebbles, mostly.Andy, we're getting to bekinda friends, aren't we?Yeah, I guess.Can I ask you something?Why did you do it?I'm innocent, Red. Justlike everybody else here.What are you in for?Murder. Same as you.Innocent?Only guilty man in Shawshank.Where's the canary?How did you know?How did I know what?So, you don't know? Come.This is where the canary is, Johnny.Quite a surprise to hear a womansinging in my house, eh, Johnny?That's quite a...surprise.Red...Wait, wait, wait, wait.Here she comes.This is the part I like... whenshe does that shit with her hair.Yeah, I know. I've seenit three times this month.Gilda, are you decent?Me?Hah! God, I love it!I understand you're a manthat knows how to get things.Yeah, I'm known to locate certain thingsfrom time to time. What do you want? Rita Hayworth. What?Can you get her?So, this is Johnny Farrell. I've hearda lot about you, Johnny Farrell. Take a few weeks. Weeks?Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffeddown the front of my pants right now,...I'm sorry to say.But I'll get her. Relax.Thanks. It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell. It certainly was. Sit down. Did you tell him what I'm doing here?No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...Take a walk. I gotta change the reel. I said fuck off!Ain't you gonna scream?Let's get this over with.He broke my fuckin' nose!Now... I'm gonna open my fly...and you're gonna swallowwhat I give you to swallow.When you're gonna swallow meinthen you're gonna swallow Rooster's.You broke his nose, he oughtto have something to show for it.Anything you put in my mouth,you're gonna lose.No. You don't understand.You do that, and I'll put all eightinches of this steel in your ear.All right.But you should know that sudden,serious brain injury causes......the victim to bite down hard.In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,they have to pry the victim'sjaws open... with a crowbar.Where did you get this shit?I read it.Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?Honey......you shouldn't.Bogs didn't put anythingin Andy's mouth...and neither did his friends.What they did do...is beat him within an inch of his life.Andy spent a month in the infirmary.Bogs spent a week in the hole.Time's up, Bogs.It's your world, boss.Return to your cellblocks for evening count.All prisoners report for lockdown.What? Where's he going? Grab his ankles.No! No!No!Help... me...Aaarghh!Two things neverhappened again after that.The Sisters neverlaid a finger on Andy again......and Bogs never walked again.They transferred him toa minimumsecurity hospital upstate.To my knowledge, he lived out the rest ofhis days drinking his food through a straw.I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcomeback when he gets out of the infirmary.Sounds good to us.I figure we owe him that much for the beer.The man likes to play chess.Let's get him some rocks.Guys...I got one. I got one. Look.Heywood, that isn't soapstone.And it ain't alabaster, either. What are you, a fucking geologist? He's right. It ain't. Well, what the hell is it? A horse apple. Bullshit. No, horse shit. Petrified.Oh, Jesus Christ!Oh, damn!Despite a few hitches,the boys came through in fine style.And by the weekend he was due back, we hadenough rocks to keep him busy till rapture.I also got a big shipment in that week.Cigarettes. Chewing gum.Sipping whiskey.Playing cards with nakedladies on them. You name it.And of course, the most important item.Rita Hayworth herself.OK, look alive! Open all tiers.Heads up. They're tossing the cells.Heads up. They're tossing the cells...On your feet.Face the wall.Turn around and face the Warden.Pleased to see you reading this.Any favorite passages?""Watch ye, therefore, for ye know notwhen the master of the house cometh.""Mark :.I always liked that one.But I prefer...""I'm the light of the world.He that followeth me shall not walk indarkness, but shall have the light of life.""John, Chapter , Verse .I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.A man should have a skill.Wanna explain this?It's called a rock blanket.It's for shaping and polishing rocks.A little hobby of mine.It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,but nothing to get in a twist over.I can't say I approve of this.But I suppose......exceptions can be made.Lock 'em up!I almost forgot.I'd hate to deprive you of this.Salvation lies within.Yes, sir.Tossing cells was just an excuse.The truth is,Norton wanted to size Andy up.My wife made that in church group.Very nice, sir.Do you enjoy working in the laundry?No, sir, not especially.Perhaps we can find something more...befitting a man of your education.Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?Andy.I thought I heard you out here!I've been reassigned to you.I know. They told me.Ain't that a kick in the head?Well, I'll give you the dime tour.Come on.Well, here she is.Shawshank Prison library.National Geographics.Reader's Digest condensed books.Louis L'Amour.Look Magazine.Erle Stanley Gardners.Every evening,I load up the cart and make my round.I enter the names on this clipboard here. Easypeasy, Japanesey. Any questions? Brooks, how long have you been librarian?Oh... I come here in ',and they made me librarian in .And in all that time,have you ever had an assistant?No. No, not much to it, really. Well, why me? Why now? I don't know,but it'll be nice to have somecompany down here for a change.Dufresne!That's him. That's the one.I'm Dekins.I was er...thinking about maybe setting up somekind of trust fund for my kids' educations.Oh...I see.Well, erm......why don't we have a seat, and talk it over?Brooks, do you havea piece of paper and a pencil?Thanks.So...Mr. Dekins...And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,""Do you want your sons to go to Harvard, or Yale?"" He didn't say that?As God is my witness, he did!Dekins just blinked for a second.Then he laughed himself silly.And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.My ass!Shook his hand.Hell, I... I near soiled myself!All Andy needed was a suit and a tieand a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,and he would have been:""Mr. Dufresne, if you please""!Making a few friends, Andy?I wouldn't say ""friends"".I'm a convicted murderer whoprovides sound financial planning.It's a wonderful pet to have. Got you out of the laundry, though. Well, it might do more than that.How about expanding the library?Get some new books in there.If you're gonna ask for something,ask for a pool table. Right. How do you expect to do that?I mean, get new books in here,Mr. Dufresne, if you please?Ask the Warden for funds.Son, son, son. Six wardens havebeen through here in my tenure,and I've learned oneimmutable, universal truth.Not one of them born...whose asshole wouldn't puckerup tighter than a snare......drum when you asked them for funds. The budget's stretched thin, as it is. I see.Perhaps I could write to the StateSenate and request funds from them.As far as they're concerned,there's only three ways to spend......tax paying hard than moneywhen it comes to prisons.more walls, more bars and more guards.Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. Aletter a week. They can't ignore me forever.Sure can.But you write your letters,if it makes you happy.I'll even mail them for you. How's that?So, Andy started writinga letter a week,... just like he said.And, just like Norton said,Andy got no answers.The following April, Andy did tax returnsfor half the guards at Shawshank.The year after that, he did them all...including the Warden's.The year after that, they rescheduledthe start of the intramural seasonto coincide with tax season.The guards on the opposing teamsall remembered to bring their Ws.So, Moresby Prison issued youyour gun, but you had to pay for it?Damn right. The holster, too.That's taxdeductible. You can write that off.Yes, sir. Andy was aregular cottage industry.In fact, it got so busy at tax time...he was allowed a staff.Hey, Red, can youhand me a stack of s?It got me out of the wood shopa month out of the year,and that was fine by me.And still... he keptsending those letters.Red... Andy.It's Brooks.Watch the door. Please, Brooks. Just calm the fuck down.Stay back! Stay back! What the hell's going on?You tell me. One second he's fine.Then out comes the knife.Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?It's what they done!I... I got no choice...You're not gonna hurt Heywood.we all know even Heywood knows that. Right, Heywood? I... I know that, sure.You won't hurt him, because he's a friend ofyours and Brooks has been a reasonable man.That's right. That's right, guys? Yes. So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.Put the knife down.Brooks...Look at his neck, for God's sake.Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.It's the only...It's the only way they'd let me stay.Come on. This is crazy.You don't want to do this, come on.Put it down.Come on. Take it easy.You're going to be all right.Him?Hell, what about me?Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.Shit, Heywood,you've had worse from shaving.What the hell did youdo to set him off, anyway?I do nothing. I come inhere to say faretheewell.Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.I just don't understand whathappened in there. That's all.The old man's as crazyas a rat in a tin shithouse.Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you. I heard he had you shitting in your pants. Fuck you!Would you knock it off?Brooks ain't no bug.He's just...He's just institutionalized.Institutionalized, my ass.The man's been in here years, Heywood.  years.This is all he knows.In here, he's an important man.He's an educated man.Outside, he's nothing.Just a usedup con witharthritis in both hands.Probably couldn't geta library card if he tried.You know what I'm trying to say?Red, I do believe you'retalking out of your ass.You believe whatever you want, Floyd.But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.First you hate 'em......then you get used to 'em.Enough time passes...you get so you depend on 'em.That's institutionalized.Shit.You can never get like that.Oh, yeah?Say that when you've beenhere as long as Brooks has.Goddamn right.They send you here for life.That's exactly what they take.The part that counts, anyway.I can't take care of you no more, Jake.You go on, now.You're free.You're free.Bye.Good luck, Brooks.Dear fellas...I can't believe how fastthings move on the outside.Watch it, oldtimer! Areyou trying to get killed?I saw an automobile once,when I was a kid, but...now... they're everywhere.The world went and gotitself in a big damn hurry.The parole board got me intothis halfway house called The Brewer,and a job, bagging groceries at the Foodway.It's hard work, and I try to keep up,but my hands hurt most of the time.Make sure your man doublebags.Last time, he didn't doublebags.The bottom near came out.Make sure you doublebag,like the lady says. Understand?Yes, sir. I surely will.I don't think the storemanager likes me very much.Sometimes, after work,I go to the park and feed the birds.I keep thinking... Jake mightjust show up and say hello.But he never does.I hope, wherever he is,he's doing OK and making new friends.I have trouble sleeping at night.I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.I wake up, scared.Sometimes it takes me a whileto remember where I am.Maybe I should get me a gun and robthe Foodway, so they'd send me home.I could shoot themanager, while I was at it.Sort of like a bonus.I guess I'm too old for thatsort of nonsense any more.I don't like it here.I'm tired of being afraid all the time.I've decided...not to stay.I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.Not for an old crook like me.""I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.Not for an old crook like me.PS. Tell Heywood I'm sorryI put a knife to his throat.No hard feelings. Brooks.""He should have died in here.What the fuck have you done?It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.What's all this?You tell me, fuckstick.They're all addressed to you.Take it.""Dear Mr. Dufresne...In response to your repeated inquiries,the State has allocated the enclosedfunds for your library project.""This is  dollars.""In addition, the Library Districthas generously respondedwith a charitable donationof used books and sundries.We trust this will fill your needs.We now consider the matter closed.Please stop sending us letters.""I want all this cleared outbefore the Warden gets back.Yes, sir.Good for you, Andy.Wow!It only took six years.From now on, I'll write twoletters a week, instead of one.Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.You'd better get all this stuff out here,like the Captain said.Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.When I come back, this is all gone, right?Wow. Sull'aria... Andy, do you hear that? ...zeffiretto  Questa sera spirera  Sotto i pini  Del boschetto  Sotto i pini... Dufresne?Dufresne?Andy, let me out.Andy?I have no idea to this day whatthose two Italian ladies were singing about.The truth is, I don't want to know.Some things are best left unsaid.I like to think they were singingabout something so beautiful,......it can't be expressed in words,... andmakes your heart ache because of it.I tell you, those voices soared...higher and farther than anybodyin a gray place dares to dream.It w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
s like some beautiful birdflapped into our drab little cageand made those walls dissolve away.And for the briefest of moments...every last man at Shawshank felt free.It pissed the Warden off something awful.Open the door.Open it up!Dufresne, open this door!Turn that off!I am warning you,Dufresne. Turn that off!Dufresne...You're mine now.Andy got two weeks inthe hole for that little stunt.On your feet! Hey, look who's here. Maestro!YYYou couldn't play something good, huh?Hank Williams or something?They broke the door downbefore I could take requests.Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?Easiest time I ever did.Bullshit! There's no suchthing as easy time in the hole.A week in the hole is like a year.I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.So, they let you tote thatrecord player down there, huh?It was in here.And in here.That's the beauty of music.They can't get that from you.Haven't you ever felt that way about music?Well, I played a mean harmonica,as a younger man.Lost interest in it, though.Didn't make much sense in here.Here's where it makes the most sense.You need it, so you don't forget.Forget?Forget that...there are places......in the world that aren't madeout of stone... that there's a...there's something...inside that,... they can't get to... that...they can't touch.It's yours.What are you talking about?Hope.Hope?Let me tell you something, my friend.Hope is a dangerous thing.Hope can drive a man insane.It's got no use on the inside.You'd better get used to that idea.Like Brooks did?Sit down.It says here that you've served years of a life sentence.You feel you've been rehabilitated?Oh, yes, sir.Without a doubt.And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.No danger to society here.God's honest truth.Absolutely rehabilitated. years.Jesus, when they say it like that...You wonder where it went.I wonder where ten years went.Here.Little parole rejection present.Go ahead and open it.I had to go through one of yourcompetitors. I hope you don't mind.I wanted it to be a surprise.It's very pretty, Andy.Thank you.Are you going to play it?No.Not right now.Tier  South. Clear.Tier  North. Clear.Tier  South. Clear.Fall in!Lights out!Andy was as good as his word.He wrote two lettersa week instead of one.In , the State Senatefinally clued into the factthey couldn't buy him offwith just a $ check.Appropriations Committee voted anannual payment of $ just to shut him up.And you'd be amazed howfar Andy could stretch it.He made deals with bookclubs, charity groups.He bought remainderedbooks by the pound.Treasure Island.Robert Louis......Stevenson.Fiction, adventure.What's next?I got here Auto Repair and......Soap Carving.Trade skills and hobbies. Goes underEducational. The stack behind you.The Count Of Monte Crisco.That's Cristo, you dumb shit.By Alexandree... Dumass.Dumbass?Dumbass?Dumas. You know what that's about?Uhuh.You'll like it. It's about a prison break.We ought to file that underEducational, too, oughtn't we?The rest of us did our best topitch in when and where we could.By the year Kennedy was shot,Andy had transformed a storage roomsmelling of rat turds and turpentineinto the best prisonlibrary in New England,complete with a fineselection of Hank Williams. Lawd I don't know what I'll doooo  All I do is sit and sigh... That was also the year Warden Nortoninstituted his famous Inside Out program.You may remember reading about it.It made all the papers and gothis picture in Look Magazine.No free ride.But rather a genuine, progressive advance,in corrections and rehabilitation.Our inmates, properly supervised,will be put to work outside these walls,performing all manner of public service.These men can learn thevalue of an honest day's labor,while providing a valuableservice to the community and...at a bare minimum of expenseto Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.Of course," Norton failedto mention to the pressthat """"bare minimum of expense""""is a fairly loose term.There are a hundred differentways to skim off the top.Men", materials, you name it.And, oh, my Lord,how the money rolled in.If this keeps up, you'llput me out of business. Ned! This pool of slave labor you've got,you can underbid any contractor in town.Ned,... we're providinga valuable community service here.Well, that's fine for the papersbut I've got a family to feed.Sam...Sam, we go back a long way.I need this new highway contract.I don't get it, and I go under. That's a fact.You just have some of this fine piemy missus made especially for you,and you think about that.Ned, I wouldn't worry toomuch about this contract.It seems to me I already gotmy boys committed elsewhere.You be sure and thankMaisie for this fine pie.And behind every shady deal,behind every dollar earned,there was Andy,keeping the books.Two deposits. Maine Nationaland New England First.Night drops as always, sir.Get my stuff down to the laundry.Two suits for dryclean and a bag of whatnot.Yes, sir.Tell them if they overstarch my shirtsagain, they'll hear about it from me.Yes, sir.How do I look? Very nice, sir. Big charity todo up Portland way.The Governor's going to be there.Want the rest of this?The woman can't bake worth shit.Thank you, sir. He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear. What you hear isn't half of it.He's got scams youhaven't even dreamed of.Kickbacks on his kickbacks.There's a river of dirty moneyrunning through this place.But the problem with having all thatmoney is you'll have to explain... where it came from. That's where I come in.I channel it, filter it, funnel it.Stocks, securities, taxfree municipals.I send that money out into the real world. And when it comes back... Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?Cleaner.By the time Norton retires,I'll have made him a millionaire.If they ever catch on, though, he's gonnawind up in here wearing a number himself.Now, Red, I thought you hada little more faith in me than that.I know you're good, Andy,but all that paper leaves a trail.Now, anybody gets curious,the FBI, the IRS, whatever, it's gonna lead to somebody. Sure it is. But not to me.And certainly not to the Warden.All right. Who?Randall Stevens.Who?The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.That's where the filtering process starts.If they trace anything,it's just going to lead to him.But who is he?He's a phantom, an apparition.Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.I conjured him... out of thin air.He doesn't exist, except on paper.Andy, you can't just make a person up.Sure you can, if you know how thesystem works, where the cracks are.It's amazing what youcan accomplish by mail.Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,a driver's license, social security number.You're shitting me?If they ever trace any of those accounts,they're going to wind up chasinga figment of my imagination.Well, I'll be damned.Did I say you were good?Shit, you're a Rembrandt!You know, the funny thing is,on the outside, I was an honestman, straight as an arrow.I had to come to prison to be a crook.Ever bother you?I don't run the scams, Red,I just process the profits.Fine line maybe but...I also built that libraryand used it to help a dozen guysget a high school diploma.Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?To keep you happy and doing the laundry.Money instead of sheets.Well," I work cheap. That's the tradeoff. I know a cat named... Tommy Williamscame to Shawshank in on a twoyear stretch for B&E.That's """"breaking and entering"""" to you.The cops caught him sneaking TV setsout the back door of a JC Penney.Young punk.Mr. Rock'n'roll.Cocky as hell.Hey", come on, old boys! Moving likemolasses! Making me look bad.We liked him immediately.So I'm backing out the door, right?And I got the TV like this.It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.Suddenly," I hears this voice.""""Freeze"," kid! Hands in the air.""""Well", I just stand there,holding onto that TV. So,finally, the voice says,Do you hear what I said," boy?""""I say"," """"Yes", sir, I sure did.But if I drop this fucking thing,you got me on destruction of property," too.""""Hey", you've done astretch in Cashman, right?Yeah. Yeah, that was an easypiece of time, let me tell you.Weekend furloughs, work programs.Not like here.Sounds like you done timeall over New England.Yeah, I've been in and out since I was .You name the place,chances are I've been there.Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?What I mean is, you don't seem to be a goodthief. Maybe you should try something else.Yeah, well, what the helldo you know about it, Capone?What are you in for?Me?The lawyer fucked me.Everybody's innocent in here.Don't you know that?As it turned out, Tommy had himselfa young wife and a new baby girl.Maybe it was the thoughtof them on the streets...or his child growing upnot knowing her daddy.Whatever it was, somethinglit a fire under that boy's ass.I was thinking of maybe tryingfor my high school equivalency.I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.I ain't no goddamn loser. You mean that? Yeah.You really mean that?Yes, sir, I do.Good. Because if we do this, we do itall the way, %, nothing halfassed.The thing is, see......I don't read so good.Well.You don't read...so well.We'll get to that. R. R... S. S... T... So Andy took Tommy under his wing.He started walkinghim through his ABCs.Tommy took to it pretty well, too.The boy found brainshe never knew he had.Before long, Andy started himon his course requirements.He really liked the kid.It gave him a thrill to help a youngstercrawl off the shit heap.But that wasn't the only reason.Prison time is slow time.So you do what you can to keep going.Some fellas collect stamps.Others build matchstick houses.Andy built a library.Now he needed a new project.Tommy was it.It was the same reason he spent yearsshaping and polishing those rocks.The same reason,he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.In prison, a man will do mostanything to keep his mind occupied.By , right about the time Tommywas getting ready to take his exams,it was lovely Raquel.Time.Well?Well, it's for shit.I wasted a whole fucking yearof my time with this bullshit.It's probably not as bad as you think.It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.It might as well have been in Chinese.Let's see how the score comes out.Well, I'll tell you how thegoddamn score comes out.Two points right there.There's your goddamn score!Goddamn cats crawling up trees, x is .Fuck this place! Fuck it!I feel bad. I let him down.Ah, that's crap, kid.He's proud of you.We've been friends a long timeso I know him as good as anybody. A smart fellow, ain't he? As smart as they come.He used to be a banker on the outside.What's he in here for, anyway?Murder.The hell you say!You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.He caught his wife in bed with somegolf pro. He greased them both.What?About four years ago,I was in Thomaston on a twotothree stretch.I stole a car. It was a dumbfuck thing to do.About six months left to go,I get a new cellmate in.Elmo Blatch.Big, twitchy fucker.Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.You know what I'm saying?Sixtotwelve, armed burglary.He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.Hard to believe, highstrung as he was.You'd cut a loud fart,he'd jump three feet in the air.Talked all the time, too.That's the other thing. He never shut up.Places he'd been in,jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.Even people he'd killed.People who gave him shit.That's how he put it.So...one night, like a joke,I say to him, I say,Yeah, Elmo," who did you kill?""""So he says...I got me this job one timebussing tables at a country club.So I could case all thesebig rich pricks that come in.So I pick out this guy",go in one night and do his place.He wakes up.He gives me shit.So I killed him.Him and this tasty bitch he was with.That's the best part.She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.But she's married to some other guy.Some hotshot banker.And he's the one they pinned it on.I have to say that's the mostamazing story I ever heard.What amazes me most isyou were taken in by it.Sir?Well...it's obvious this fella Williamsis impressed with you.He hears your tale of woe and quitenaturally wants to cheer you up.He's young, not terribly bright.Not surprising he wouldn't knowwhat a state he'd put you in.Sir, he's telling the truth.Well, let's say, for the moment,this Blatch does exist.You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,Yes, I did it! I confess!And by the way," add a lifeterm to my sentence""""?That doesn't matter. With Tommy'stestimony", I can get a new trial.That's assuming Blatch is even still there.The chances are he'd be released by now.They'd have his last address,names of relatives.There's a chance, it isn't?How can you be so obtuse?What? What did you call me? Obtuse. Is it deliberate?Son, you're forgetting yourself.The country club will have his old timecards,records, Ws, with his name on them.Dufresne, If you indulge thisfantasy, that's your business.Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.Sir, if I were to ever get out, I wouldnever mention what goes on in here.I'd be just as indictable asyou for laundering money.Don't ever mention money to me again,you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office.Not anywhere! Get in here now.I'm just trying to set your mindat ease, that's all. Sir, I...Solitary. A month. Yes, sir. What's the matter with you? Get him out of here. This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?It's my life! Don't you understand, my life? Get him out! Get him out! This is my life!No!A month in the hole.It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.It's all my fault.Oh, bullshit.You didn't pull the triggerand you certainly didn't convict him.Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?I mean, for real innocent?It looks that way.Sweet Jesus.How long's he been here now?. What is that? years... Williams, Thomas. Yeah, over here. Paxon, Edward. Yeah.What you got? Board of Education. The son of a bitch mailed it. Looks like he did.Are you gonna open it or stand therewith your thumb up your butt?The thumb up my butt sounds better.Hey, Skeet, come on,give me that, you shithead. Floyd, come on. Over here, over here!Hey, Red!Come on, will you throw that away, please?Well, shit.The kid passed. C+ average.Thought you'd like to know.The Warden wants to talk. Out here? That's what the man said.Warden?Tommy.Tommy...I'm asking you to keep thisconversation just between us.I feel awkward enough as it is.We got a situation here.I think you can appreciate that.Yes, sir.I sure can.I tell you, son, this thing really camealong and knocked my wind out.It's got me up nights, that's the truth.The right thing to do.Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.You understand?I need your help, son.If I'm going to move on this,there can't be the least little shred of doubt.I have to know if what youtold Dufresne was the truth.Yes, sir.Absolutely.Would you be willing to swearbefore a judge and jury,having placed your hand on the Good Bookand taken an oath beforeAlmighty God himself?Just give me that chance.That's what I thought.I'm sure by now you've heard...A terrible thing.A man that young, less thana year to go, trying to escape.It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.Truly, it did.We just have to put it behind us.Move on.I'm done.Everything stops.Get someone else to run your scams.Nothing stops.Nothing.Or you will do the hardest time there is.No more protection from the guards.I'll pull you out of that onebunk Hiltonand cast you down with the Sodomites.You'll think you've been fucked by a train.And the library?Gone. Sealed off, brick by brick.We'll have us a little bookbarbecue in the yard.They'll see the flames for miles.We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.You understand me?Catching my drift?Or am I being obtuse?Give him another month to think about it.My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.Like a closed book.Complained about it all the time.She was beautiful.God, I loved her.I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.I killed her, Red.I didn't pull the trigger.But I drove her away.That's why she died, because of me.The way I am.That don't make you a murderer.A bad husband, maybe.Feel bad about it if you want to,but you didn't pull the trigger.No, I didn't.Somebody else did.And I wound up in here.Bad luck, I guess.Yeah.It floats around.It's got to land on somebody.It was my turn, that's all.I was in the path of the tornado.I just didn't expect the stormwould last as long as it has.Do you think you'll ever get out of here?Me?Yeah.One day, when I've got a long, white beardand two or three marbles rollingaround upstairs, they'll let me out.I tell you where I'd go.Zihuatanejo.Zi... what?Zihuatanejo.It's in Mexico.A little place on the Pacific Ocean.You know what the Mexicanssay about the Pacific?No.They say it has no memory.That's where I want to live the rest of my life.A warm place with no memory.Open up a little hotel,right on the beach.Buy some worthless old boat,fix it up new.Take my guests out.Charter fishing.Zihuatanejo, huh?In a place like that, I could use a manwho knows how to get things.I don't think I could makeit on the outside, Andy.I've been in here most of my life.I'm an institutional man now.Just like Brooks was.Well, you underestimate yourself.I don't think so.I mean... in here, I'm the guy whocan get things for you, sure, but...Outside, all you needis the Yellow Pages.Hell, I wouldn't evenknow where to begin.The Pacific Ocean?Shit.About scare me to death,something that big.Not me.I didn't shoot my wife andI didn't shoot her lover.Whatever mistakes I've made,I've paid for them and then some.That hotel, that boat.I don't think that's too much to ask.I don't think you ought to bedoing this to yourself, Andy.These are just shitty pipe dreams.I mean, Mexico is way the helldown there and you're in here...and that's the way it is.Yeah, right. That's the way it is.It's down there and I'm in here.I guess it comes downto a simple choice, really.Get busy livingor get busy dying.Andy.Red.If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.Sure, Andy.Anything.There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.You know where Buxton is?Well, just... There's a lotof hayfields up there.One in particular. It's got a long rock wall,with a big oak tree at the north end.It's like something outof a Robert Frost poem.It's where I asked my wife to marry me.We went there for a picnicand made love under that oak.I asked and she said yes.Promise me, Red,if you ever get out, find that spot.At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock thathas no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.A piece of black, volcanic glass.There's something buriedunder it, I want you to have.What, Andy?What's buried under there?You'll have to pry it up... to see.No, I'm telling you, the guy is...He's talking funnier. I'm really worried about him. We ought to keep an eye on him.That's fine during the day, butat night he's got that cell all to himself.Oh, Lord.What?Andy come down to the loading dock today. He asked me for a length of rope. Rope? Six feet long. And you gave it to him? Sure I did. Why wouldn't I? Jesus, Heywood.Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?Remember Brooks Hatlen?No.Andy would never do that.Never.I don't know.Every man has his breaking point.Licketysplit. I want to get home.Just about finished, sir.Three deposits tonight.Get my stuff down to the laundry.And shine my shoes.I want 'em looking like mirrors.Yes, sir.It's good having you back, Andy.The place wasn't the same without you.Lights out!<u>I've had some long nights in stir.</u>Alone in the dark withnothing but your thoughts,time can draw out like a blade.That was the longest night of my life.Give me a count.Tier  South. Clear.Tier  North. Clear. Tier  North. Clear. Man missing on Tier . Cell .Dufresne.Get your ass out here, boy.You're holding up the show.Don't make me come down there.I'll thump your skull for you.Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!I got a schedule to keep.You'd better be sick or dead in there,I shit you not!You hear me?Oh, my holy God.I want every man onthis cell block questioned. Start with that friend of his. Who?Him!Open .What do you mean, he just wasn't here?Don't say that to me, Haig.Don't say that to me again. But, sir, he wasn't. I can see that, Haig!You think I'm blind?Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?No, sir.What about you?Are you blind? Tell me what this is. Last night's count.You see Dufresne's name there?I sure do. See? Right there.Dufresne.He was in his cell at lights out.It stands to reason he'dstill be here in the morning.I want him found.Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!Yes, sir!Let's go, let's go!Move your butts! Move it!Stand.Well?Well, what?I see you two all the time.You're thick as thieves, you are.He must have said something.No, sir, Warden.Not a word.Lord, it's a miracle!A man up and vanishedlike a fart in the wind.Nothing left but...some damn rocks on a windowsill.And that cupcake onthe wall. Let's ask her.Maybe she knows. What say there,Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?Ah... I guess not.Why should she be any different?This is a conspiracy.That's what this is.One... big...damn conspiracy!And everyone's in on it!Including her!In ,Andy Dufresne escapedfrom Shawshank Prison.All they found of himwas a muddy set of prison clothes,a bar of soapand an old rock hammerdamn near worn down to the nub.I remember thinking it would take a man years to tunnel through the wall with it.Old Andy did it in less than .Oh, Andy loved geology.I imagine it appealed tohis meticulous nature.An Ice Age here,a million years of mountainbuilding there.Geology is the study of pressure and time.That's all it takes, really.Pressure...and time.That and a big goddamn poster.Like I said,in prison, a man will do most anythingto keep his mind occupied.It turns out Andy's favorite hobby wastoting his wall out into the exercise yard.A handful at a time.I guess after Tommy was killed,Andy decided he'd been herejust about long enough.Licketysplit.I want to get home.I'm just about finished, sir.Three deposits tonight.Andy did like he was told.Buffed those shoesto a high mirror shine.The guard simply didn't notice.Neither did I.I mean, seriously, how oftendo you really look at a man's shoes?Andy crawled to freedom through  yardsof shitsmelling foulness I can't even imagine.Or maybe I just don't want to. yards.That's the lengthof five football fields.Just shy of half a mile.The next morning, right about the timeRaquel was spilling her little secret,a man nobody ever laid eyes on beforestrode into the Maine National Bank.Until that moment,he didn't exist, except on paper. May I help you?He had all the proper ID,driver's license, birth certificate,social security card.And the signature was a spoton match.I must say, I'm sorry tobe losing your business.I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.Thank you.I'm sure I will.Here's your cashier's check, sir.Will there be anything else?Please...Would you add thisto your outgoing mail?I'd be happy to. Good day, sir. Good day.Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozenbanks in the Portland area that morning.All told, he blew town with better than$, of Warden Norton's money.Severance pay for  years.Good morning,Portland Daily Bugle.Byron Hadley? You havethe right to remain silent.If you give upthe right to remain silent,......anything you say will be heldagainst you in court of law.I wasn't there to see it.But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbinglike a little girl when they took him away.Norton had no intentionof going that quietly.Samuel Norton?We have a warrantfor your arrest.

I was justsaving you the trouble.Bobby, if you don'teat your dinner...I'm gonna have toturn off that television.Why, Mama?I'm gonna be eating this foodfor the next two weeks.Hey, you heard your mama.You finish your meal, andthen you can watch the game.Daddy?Daddy.Hell, we don't eatwith our eyes.You want your boy to grow up...to be a man,don't you, Daughter?Boys should watch football.Not until he finisheseating the meal...that his mama tookthree hours to fix.Now you sit down,you old son of a bitch!This is my house,this is my child...and you are my guest.Now you sit down...before I knock yourignorant ass into next week.Daddy, tell about when yourode broncs in the rodeo.Well,that's a short story, honey.It was only about threeseconds I was on that bronc.The next thing I knew, I wasflying through the air...only I was no angellike you and Jenny here.I didn't have no wings.And that's the storyof my saddle bronc career.[TV chattering)There you go.You ought to getmarried again, Ennis.Me and the girls worryabout you bein' alone so much.Well, once burned...You still go fishingwith Jack Twist?Not often.You know, I used to wonder how comeyou never brought any trouts home.You always saidyou caught plenty...and you know howme and the girls like fish.So, one night,I got your creel case open...night before you wenton one of your little trips.Price tag still on itafter five years.And I tied a noteto the end of the line.It said, ""Hello, Ennis, bringsome fish home. Love, Alma.""And then you come backlookin' all perky...and said you caught a bunch ofbrownies and you ate them up.Do you remember?I looked in that casefirst chance I got...and there was my notestill tied there.That line hadn't touched waterin its life.That don't mean nothing, Alma.Don't try and fool meno more, Ennis.I know what that means.Jack Twist. Alma. Jack ""Nasty""!You didn't go up thereto fish. You and him...Now you listen to me, youdon't know nothing about it.I'm going to yell for Monroe.You do it and I'll make youeat the fucking floor.Get out! And you, too! Get out! Get out!Get out of my house, Ennis Del Mar!You hear me? You get out!Daddy?Alma?Bye, Daddy!Bye.Hey, asshole,watch where you're goin'!Jesus. What...Jesus...You stupid fuck!God damn!God. God damn.Oh, fuck!Damn it!All I'm sayin' is,what's the point of making it?If the taxes don't get it, theinflation will eat it all up.You should see Lureen punchin'numbers in her adding machine.Hunting for extra zeros, her eyesgettin' smaller and smaller.It's like watchin' a rabbittryin' to...squeeze into a snake holewith a coyote on its tail.That's some high classentertainment, if you ask me.For what it's worth.You and Lureen,it's normal and all?Sure.She don't ever suspect?You ever get the feelin'...I don't know...when you're in town...and someone looks at you...suspicious, like he knows.Then you go out on the pavementand everyone's lookin' at you...like they all know, too?Well, maybe you ought toget out of there, you know?Find yourself someplacedifferent, maybe Texas.Texas?Sure, and maybeyou can convince Alma...to let you and Lureenadopt the girls.Then we could justlive together, herdin' sheep.And it'll rain moneyfrom L.D. Newsome...and whiskey will flow in the streams.Jack, that's real smart.Go to hell, Ennis Del Mar.You wanna live your miserable fucking life?Then go right ahead.Fine.I was just thinkin' out loud.Yup, you're a realthinker there. God damn...Jack fucking Twist.Got it all figured out,ain't he?All right, hon.Just finished my shift.Wanna dance? I was on my way to the... I'm Cassie. Cassie Cartwright.Ennis. Del Mar.No more dancin' for me, I hope. You're safe. Yeah? My feet hurt. Hard work, is it?Yeah, drunks like youdemanding beer after beer...smokin'. Gets tiresome.What do you do, Ennis Del Mar?Well, earlier today,I was castrating calves.What are you doing?Trying to geta foot rub, dummy.All right.That good?And then I pledgedTri Delt at SMU.And I sure never thought...I'd end up in a pokylittle place like Childress.Then I met old Randall hereat an Aggie game...and he was an animalhusbandry major.So we've been here for a monthand he got the foreman job...over at Roy Taylor's ranch.Like it or not, here I am!Was you Tri Delt?I was Kappa Phi myself.Well, even though we ain'tquite sorority sisters...we just may have to dancewith ourselves, Lureen.Our husbands ain't the leastbit interested in dancin'.They ain't got a smidgenof rhythm between them.It's funny, isn't it?Husbands don't never seem towanna dance with their wives.Why do you think that is, Jack?I don't know,I never give it any thought.Wanna dance? Yes, thank you. Do you mind?No, it's all right. Go ahead.All right.Pardon us.Thank you for asking meto dance with you.I really appreciate that.Randall never does.Last time I did,I think it was our wedding.It's a good thing you and Lureenhappened along when you did...or else we'd still be stuckon the side of the road...in that darn pickup.I told Randallwe ought to take the car.Of course,he'd never listen to me.He wouldn't listen to meif he was goin' deaf tomorrow.I told him it'd take more thanchewing gum and baling wire...to fix that pickup.Well, he's never beenvery mechanical, though.Come over here and ask...You ever notice how a womanwill powder her nose...before she goes to a party?And then she'll powder itagain once the party's over.I mean, why powder your nosejust to go home and go to bed?Don't know.Even if I wanted to know...I couldn't get a word in withLashawn long enough to ask.Woman talks a blue streak.Lively little gal.You'll like workingfor Roy Taylor. He's solid, Roy. Yeah, Roy. He's a good old boy.He's got a little cabindown on Lake Kemp.Got a crappie house,little boat.Said I could use itwhenever I want.We ought to go down theresome weekend.Drink a little whiskey,fish some.Get away, you know?That was right out of SMU.I could've had my pick of prettymuch any job in North Dallas.So my pick was Neiman Marcus,which was a disaster...because, honey, where clothes isconcerned, I got no resistance.I was spending more than I made.More than Randall ever will make.We come out here...thinkin' that ranchin' wasstill big hats and Marlboros.Boy, were we behind the times.Hey there, Junior. You ready?What do you think?Your daddy ever gonna seefit to settle down again?Don't know. Maybe he's notthe marrying kind.You don't think so?Or you don't thinkI'm the one for him?You're good enough.You don't say much,but you get your point across.Sorry.I didn't mean to be rude.All right.You're stayin'on your feet, cowboy.Excuse me, darling.So I'll pick you and Jenny upnext weekend, after church.Fine.You all right?Yes.Are you sure?Daddy, I was thinking, whatwith the new baby and all...Ma and Monroe have beenawful strict on me.More on me than Jenny even.I was thinkin',maybe I could...Maybe I could comestay with you.I'd be an awful good help,I know I would.Now, you knowI ain't set up for that.With the roundup comin'...I won't ever be home.It's all right, Daddy.I'm not sayin' that I wouldn't...It's all right, I understand.Well, see you on Sunday, then.Bye.Bye, sweetheart.Going to snow tonight for sure.Yup.All this time and you ain'tfound nobody else to marry?I been puttin' the blocks...to a goodlookin' little galover in Riverton.She's a waitress. Wants to goto nursing school or somethin'.I don't know.What about you and Lureen?Lureen's good at making hard dealsin the machinery business...but as far asour marriage goes...we could do it over the phone.I kind of got this thinggoing with...a ranch foreman's wifeover in Rutters. What? I'm bound to get shot...by Lureen or her husband eachtime I slip off to see her.You probably deserve it.Tell you what.The truth is...sometimes I miss you so much,I can hardly stand it.I guess I'll head upon to Lightning Flat.See the folks for a day or two.There's somethin' I beenmeanin' to tell you, bud.Well, it's likely November beforeI can come out here again.After we ship stock and beforewinter feedin' starts again.November.What in the hell ever happenedto August?Well...Christ, Ennis.You know, you had a fucking week tosay some little word about this.Why is it we're alwaysin the friggin' cold?We ought to go southwhere it's warm, you know!We ought to go to Mexico.Mexico?Hell, Jack, you know me. Aboutall the travelin' I ever done...is around a coffee pot,looking for the handle.Come on, Jack.Lighten up on me.We can hunt in November.Kill us a nice elk.I'll try if I can getDon Wroe's cabin again.We had a good time that year,didn't we?There's never enough time,never enough.You know, friend...this is a goddamn bitch ofan unsatisfactory situation.You used to come away easy.Now it's like seein' the Pope.Jack, I got to work.In them earlier days,I'd just quit the job.You...You forget what it's likebein' broke all the time.You ever hear of child support?I'll tell you this,I can't quit this one...and I can't get the time off.It was hard enoughgettin' this time.The tradeoff was August.Well, you got a better idea?I did, once.You did, once.Well, have you been to Mexico,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's all right.Damn you, Ennis.I just can't standthis any more, Jack.Come on now, you're sleepin'on your feet like a horse.My mama used to say that to mewhen I was little.And sing to me.I got to go.See you in the morning.Excuse me.Hey.Ennis Del Mar.Where you been?Here and there.I left word for youwith Steve at the ranch.And you must've got thosenotes I left at your place.Looks like I got the message,in any case.Carl?Yeah, Carl's nice.He even talks.Good for you.Yeah.Good for me.I don't get you, Ennis Del Mar.I'm sorry.I was probablyno fun anyways, was I?Ennis, girls don'tfall in love with fun.Hello.Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.Who? Who is this?Ennis Del Mar.I'm an old buddy of Jack's.Jack used to mention you.You're the fishing buddy or thehunting buddy, I know that.Would have let you knowwhat happened...but I wasn't sureabout your name or address.Jack kept his friends'addresses in his head.That's why I'm callin',to see what happened.Oh, yeah.Jack was pumpin' up a flaton the truck...out on a back road,when the tire blew up.The rim of the tire slammedinto his face...broke his nose and jaw and knockedhim unconscious on his back.By the time somebody come along,he'd drowned in his own blood.He was only  years old.Hello? Hello?Hello.Was he buried down there?We put a stone up.He was cremated,like he wanted.Half his ashes was interred here, therest was sent up with his folks.He use to say he wanted his ashesscattered on Brokeback Mountain...but I wasn't surewhere that was.I thought Brokeback Mountain mightbe around where he grew up.Knowing Jack...it might be somepretend place...where bluebirds singand there's a whiskey spring.No, ma'am...we was herdin' sheepon Brokeback one summer...back in '.Well, he saidit was his favorite place.I thought he meant toget drunk. He drank a lot.Is his folks still upin Lightning Flat?They'll be theretill the day they die.Thank you for your time.I sure am sorry.We was good friends.Get in touch with his folks.I suppose they'd appreciate itif his wishes was carried out.About the ashes, I mean.Want a cup of coffee, don't you?Piece of cherry cake?Yes, ma'am,"I'll have a cup of coffee...but I can't eat no cakejust now. Thank you.I feel awful bad about Jack.Thank you.I can't begin to tell youhow bad I feel.I knew him a long time.I come by to say that...if you want me to take hisashes up there on Brokeback...like his wife saidhe wanted to...then I'll be happy to.I'll tell you what.I know whereBrokeback Mountain is.Thought he was too goddamn specialto be buried in the family plot.Jack used to say...""""Ennis Del Mar","he used to say.""""I'm gonna bring him up hereone of these days...""""""""and we'll lick thisdamn ranch into shape.""""He had somehalfbaked notion...the two of you was gonnamove up here...build a cabin...help run the place.Then", this spring...he got another fellagonna come up here with him...build the place,help run the ranch.Some ranch neighbor of hisfrom down in Texas.Gonna split up with his wifeand come back here...so he says.But, like most ofJack's ideas...never come to pass.I kept his roomlike it was when he was a boy.I think he appreciated that.You are welcome to go upto his room, if you want.Yeah, I'd like that.

Hey.Link Here's the link room right here.This is wherewe're connecting to the avatar.Me and Norm are here to drivethese remotely controlled bodiescalled avatars.And they're grown from human DNAmixed with the DNA of the natives.

Great to meet you. Good to meet you, yeah.Looks like him.No, it looks like you.This is your avatar now, Jake.And the concept is that every driveris matched to his own avatar,so that their nervous systems are in tune,or something.Which is why they offered me the gig,because I can link with Tommy's avatar,which is insanely expensive.Is this right?I just say whatever to the video log?Yeah, we gotta get in the habitof documenting everything.You know, what we see, what we feel. It's all part of the science. And good science is good observation.Plus it'll help to keep you sanefor the next six years.All right.

Lucky? Yeah.How is this in any way lucky?Lucky your guy had a twin brother,and lucky that brother wasn'tsome oral hygienist or something.A Marine we can use.I'm assigning himto your team as security escort.The last thing I need is anothertriggerhappy moron out there!Look, look,you're supposed to be winning the heartsand the minds of the natives.Isn't that the whole point ofyour little puppet show?If you look like themand you talk like them,then they'll start trusting us.We buildthem English,but after, what, how many years?Relations with the indigenousare only getting worse.Yeah, that tends to happenwhen you use machine guns on them.Right.

I kind of like it.It reminds me every daywhat's waiting out there.The Avatar Program is a bad joke.Bunch of limpdick science majors.However, it does present an opportunityboth timely and unique. Clear! Clear!A recon gyrene in an avatar body.That's a potent mix.Give me the goose bumps.Such a Marinedethe intel I need,right on the ground.Right in the hostiles' camp.Look, Sully. I want youto learn these savages from the inside.I want you to gain their trust.I need to knowhow to force their cooperationor hammer them hard if they won't. Am I still with Augustine? On paper.Yeah, you walk like one of herscience pukes, you quack like one,but you report to me.Can you do that for me, son?Hell, yeah, sir.Well, all right, then.Son, I take care of my own.You get me what I need,I'll see to it you get your legs backwhen you rotate home.Your real legs.That sounds real good, sir.

Guess. What if they won't go? I'm betting that they will.Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.Killing the indigenous looks bad,but there's one thing that shareholdershate more than bad press,and that's a bad quarterly statement.I didn't make up the rules.So just find me a carrotthat'll get them to move,otherwise it's gon'dozers get there.Well, we're wasting time.I like this guy. Guys, right now Okay, let's run through them again.Mo'at. Dragon lady. Eytucan. Eytukan. He's the clan leader.But she's the spiritual leader.Like a shaman.Got it. T'su'tey. Tsu'tey. Tsu'tey.

So where are we going? Getting out of Dodge.I'm not about to let Selfridgeand Quaritch micromanage this thing.There's a mobile linkup at Site  we can work out of,way up in the mountains.The Hallelujah Mountains? That's right. Are you serious? Yeah. Yes!The legendary floating mountainsof Pandora. Heard of them?We're getting close.Yeah, look at my instruments.Yep.

I see you.But it's not just,I'm seeing you in front of me,it's I see into you. I See you.It's good he's back on board,but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.I'm accepting you. I understand you.So you gotta get this, okay?I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.My feet are getting tougher.I can run farther every day.I have to trust my bodyto know what to do.Yeah! Check it out!Oh, crap!Every day it's reading the trails,the tracks at the waterhole,the tiniest scents and sounds.She's always going on aboutthe flow of energy, the spirits of animals.I really hope this treehugger crapisn't on the final.This isn't just about eyehandcoordination out there, you know.You need to listen to what she says.Try to see the forest through herdie.You gotta be kidding me.I talked Mo'at intoletting Grace into the village.<font color=#fcf>Look how big you are.It's the first timesince her school was closed down.<font color=#fcf>You areso pretty .No, you don't.

I could do that. You need to muzzle your dog.Yeah, can we just take this downa couple of notches, please?You say you want tokeep your people alive?You start by listening to her.Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine. You know what?You throw a stick in the air around here,it's gonna land on some sacred fern, for Christ's sake! I'm not talkingabout some kind of pagan voodoo here.I'm talking about something real,something measurablein the biology of the forest.Which is what, exactly?What we think we knowis that there is some kind ofelectrochemical communicationbetween the roots of the trees,like the synapses between neurons.And each tree has tentothefourthconnections to the trees around it.And there are tentothetwelfth treeson Pandora.Which is a lot, I'm guessing.It's more connectionsthan the human brain.Get it? It's a network.It's a global network,and the Na'vi can access it.They can upload and download data.Memories.At s.Yes!What the hell have you peoplebeen smoking out there?They're just goddamn trees! You need to wake up, Parker. No. You need to wake up.The wealth of this world isn'tin the ground. It's all around us.The Na'vi know that,and they are fighting to defend it.lf you want to share this world with them,you need to understand them.I'd say we understand them just fine,thanks to Jake here.Hey, Doc, come take a look.They're not gonna give up their home.They're not gonna make a deal.For what? Lite beer?And blue jeans?There's nothing that we havethat they want.Everything they sent me out here to dois a waste of time.They're never gonna leave Hometree.So, since a deal can't be made,I guess things get real simple.Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.I might just give you a big wet kiss.I'll do it with minimal casualtiesto the indigenous.I'll drive them out with gas first.It'll be humane.More or less.All right, let's pull the trigger.

What's the pla, Jake? There's no plan.Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.He's not gonna let you near that place.I gotta try.Launching.Outcast.Betrayer.Alien.I was in the place the eye does not see.I needed thei, and they needed mine.But to ever face them again,I was gonna have to take itto a whole new level.Sometimes your whole life boils downto one insane move.There's something we gotta do.You're not gonna like it.The way I had it figured,Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.Nothing attacks him.Easy, boy.So why would he ever look up?But that was just a theory.Toruk Macto?I See you.I See you.I was afraid, Jake.For my people.I'm not anymore.<font color=#fcf, son of Ateyo <font color=#fcf> I stand before you <font color=#fcf> ready to serve,and you are a great warrior.I can't do this without you.Toruk Macto,I will fly with you.My friend is dying.Grace is dying.I beg the help of Eywa.Look where we are, Grace.I need to take some samples.The Great Mother may chooseto save all that she isin this body.Is that possible?She must pass through the eye of Eywaand return.But, Jakesully,she is very weak.Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.<font color=#fcf>Hear u, All Mother.<font color=#fcf, help her.<font color=#fcf>Take this spirit into you <font color=#fcf> and breathe her back to us.<font color=#fcf>Let her walk among us<font color=#fcf, Jake.She's real!Grace?

Grace!What's happening?What's happening?Grace!Grace!What's happening?Did it work?Her wounds were too great.It was not enough time.She is with Eywa now.With your permission, I will speak now.You would honor me by translating.The Sky People have sent us a messagethat they can take whatever they wantand no one can stop them.Well, we will send them a message.You ride out as fastas the wind can carry you.You tell the other clans to come.You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.And you fly now with me!My brothers! Sisters!And we will show the Sky Peoplethat they cannot take whatever they want,and that this,this is our land!Yah!Yah!Yah!We rode out to the four winds.To the horse clans of the plain.Back to the stars!To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.For our children's children!When Toruk Macto called them, they came.Yah!Everyone on this base, every one of you,is fighting for survival.That's a fact!There's an aboriginal horde out theremassing for an attack.Now, these orbital images tell methat the hostiles' numbershave gone from a few hundredto well over , in one day.And more are pouring in.ln a week's time,there could be , of them.At that point,they will overrun our perimeter.Well, that's not gonna happen!Our only security liesin preemptive attack.We will fight terror with terror.Now, the hostiles believethat this mountain stronghold of theirsis protected by theirTheir deity.And when we dest,we will blast a craterin their racial memory so deepthat they won't comewithin , klicks of this place ever again.And that, too, is a fact.Yeah! Yeah.Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.They've got these huge palletsof mine explosives.It's for some kindof shockandawe campaign.Fricking daisy cutters!Quaritch has taken over.He's rolling, and there's no stopping him. When?  tomorrow. Max! Max! I gotta go.We're screwed!And I was hopingfor some sort of tactical planthat didn't involve martyrdom.We're going up against gunshipswith bows and arrows.I have  clan, warriors.Now, we know these mountains.We fly them. You fly them. They don't.Their instruments won't work up here.Missile tracking won't work.They'll have to fire a line of sight.lf they bring the fight to us,then we have the homefield advantage.You know he's gonna commit that bomberstraight to the Tree of Souls.Yeah, I know.lf they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.That's their direct line to Eywa,their ancestors.It'll destroy them.Then I guess we'd better stop him.I'm probably just talkingto a tree right now.But if you're there,I need to give you a headsup.lf Grace is with you,look into her memories.See the world we come from.There's no green there.They killed their Mother.And they're gonna do the same here.More Sky People are gonna come.They're gonna comelike a rain that never ends.Unless we stop them.Look, you chose me for something.I will stand and fight.You know I will.But I need a little help here.Our Great Motherdoes not take sides, Jake.She protects only the balance of life.It was worth a try.Yeah!

I know we're close.We've just got to go through a littleprocess of elimination.Hang on a second. Let me see that. We may have something here, guys.Where's the photographof the necklace?We'll call you right back.I'll be goddamned.Treasure hunter Brock Lovettis best known for finding Spanish gold...It's okay. I'll feed you in a minute.Now he has chartered Russian subs to reach themost famous shipwreck of all, the Titanic.He is with us live via satellitefrom the research ship Keldysh...in the North Atlantic. Hello. Brock.Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knowsthe familiar stories of Titanic.You know, the nobility of theband playing to the very end and all that.But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.And we're out here using robottechnology to go further into the wreck...than anybody has ever done before.Your expedition is at the centerof a storm of controversy...over salvage rights and even ethics.Many are calling you a graverobber.Well, nobody ever called therecovery of the artifacts...What is it?Turn that up, dear.I have museumtrained expertssent out here making sure...that these relics are preservedand catalogued properly.Take a look at this drawingthat we found just today.A piece of paper that's been underwaterfor  years.And my team are able topreserve it intact.Should this have remained unseenat the bottom of the ocean for eternity...when we can see and enjoy it now?I'll be goddamned.Brock!There's a satellite call for you.Bobby, we're launching. You seethese submersibles going in the water?Trust me, buddy.You want to take this call.This better be good.Now, you gotta speak up.She's kind of old.Great.This is Brock Lovett.How can I help you, Mrs...?Calvert. Rose Calvert.Mrs. Calvert.I was just wondering if you had found...the ""Heart of theOcean"" yet, Mr. Lovett.Told you you wanted to take the call.All right, you have myattention, Rose.Can you tell us who the womanin the picture is?Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.She's a goddamn liar!Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.God only knows why.Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.They're inbound!Rose DeWitt Bukater died on theTitanic when she was , right? That's right. If she had lived, she'd be over  by now. next month.Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.Look, I've already done thebackground on this woman...all the way back to the s,when she was working as an actress.An actress.There's your first clue, Sherlock.Her name was Rose Dawson back then.Then she marries this guy named Calvert.They move to Cedar Rapidsand she punches out a couple of kids.Now Calvert's dead and, from whatI hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.And everybody who knows about thediamond is supposed to be dead...or on this boat, but she knows.Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?Hurry up, give him a hand.Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.Welcome to the Keldysh.Okay, let's get her inside there.Hi, Miss Calvert. Hi. Welcome to the Keldysh.Thanks.Hey!Are your staterooms all right?Oh, yes.Very nice.Have you met mygranddaughter, Lizzy?She takes care of me.We met just a few minutes ago.Remember, Nana? Up on deck?Oh, yes.There. That's nice.Have to have mypictures when I travel.Can I get you anything?Is there anything you'd like?Yes.I would like to see my drawing.Louis XVI wore a fabulousstone that was...called the Blue Diamondof the Crown...which disappeared in ...about the same time old Louis losteverything from the neck up.The theory goes that thecrown diamond was chopped, too.Recut into a heartlike shape thatbecame known as...the Heart of the Ocean.Today it would be worthmore than the Hope diamond.It was a dreadful, heavy thing.I only wore it this once.You actually thinkthis is you, Nana?It is me, dear.Wasn't I a dish?I tracked it downthrough insurance records.An old claim that was settledunder terms of absolute secrecy.Can you tell me who theclaimant was, Rose?I should imagine someonenamed Hockley.Nathan Hockley, that's right.Pittsburgh steel tycoon.The claim was for adiamond necklace his son...Caledon, bought his fiance.You.A week before hesailed on Titanic.And it was filed rightafter the sinking.So the diamond had to havegone down with the ship.You see the date?April , .Which means if your grandmotheris who she says she is...she was wearing the diamondthe day the Titanic sank.And that makes youmy new best friend.These are some of the thingswe recovered from your stateroom.This was mine.How extraordinary.And it looks the same as itdid the last time I saw it.The reflection haschanged a bit.Are you ready to goback to Titanic?Okay, here we go.She hits the berg onthe starboard side, right?She kind of bumps along...punching holes likemorse code...ditditdit... along the side...below the water line.Then the forward compartmentsstart to flood.Now, as the waterlevel rises...it spills over thewatertight bulkheads...which, unfortunately, don't goanyher than E deck.So now as the bow goes down...the stern rises up,slow at first...then faster and faster...until finally, she's got her wholeass sticking up in the air.And that's a big ass.We're talking, , tons. Okay?And the hull's not designedto deal with that pressure.So, what happens?She splits, rightdown to the keel.And the stern...falls back level.Then...as the bow sinks...it pulls the stern vertical...and then finally detaches.Now the stern section just kind of bobs therelike a cork for a couple of minutes...floods, and finally goesunder about : AM... hours and  minutesafter the collision.The bow section planes away...landing about ahalf a mile away...going ,  knots whenit hits the ocean floor.Pretty cool?Thank you for that fineforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.Of course, theexperience of it was...somewhat different.Will you share it with us?I'm taking her to rest.No.Come on, Nana.No!Give me the tape recorder.Tell us, Rose.It's been  years...It's okay. Just tryto remember anything...anything at all.Do you want to hear thisor not, Mr. Lovett?It's been  years...and I can still smellthe fresh paint.The china had never been used.The sheets hadnever been slept in.Titanic was calledthe ship of dreams.And it was.It really was.All thirdclass passengers...with a forward berth...this way please! This queue!It's a big boat?Daddy, it's a ship.You're right.I don't see what allthe fuss is about.It doesn't look any biggerthan the Mauretania.You can be blasabout some things, Rose...but not about Titanic.It's over  feet longerthan Mauretania...and far more luxurious.Your daughter is far toodifficult to impress, Ruth.So this is the ship theysay is unsinkable.It is unsinkable.God Himselfcould not sink this ship...What?!You have to check your baggagethrough the main terminal.It's round that way, sir.I put my faith in you good sir.Now kindly see my man.Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.If I can do anything at all...Yes, right.All the trunks fromthat car there. from here.And the safe,to the parlor suite...rooms B, , .Ladies...we br hurry.Come along. My coat? I have it, miss.All thirdclass passengersqueue here for health inspection. Welcome aboard, ma'am. Welcome to Titanic.It was the ship of dreams...to everyone else.To me. It was a slave ship...taking me back toAmerica in chains.Outwardly, I was everythinga well brought up girl should be.Inside, I was screaming.Jack, you are pazzo.You bet everything we have.When you got nothing,you got nothing to lose.Sven?All right, moment of truth.Someone's life isabout to change.Fabrizio?Niente.Olaf?Nothing.Sven? pair.I'm sorry, Fabrizio.I'm sorry...you're not gonna seeyour mom again for a...Long time...'cause we're going to America.Full house, boys!Come on.I'm going home!I'm going home.I go to America!No, mate.Titanic go to America,in  minutes.Shit. Fabri. Come on.Come on, here. Here.We're riding in high style now!We're a couple ofregular swells.We're practicallygoddamn royalty...ragazzo mio.You see? Is my destino.Like I told you...I go to America tobe millionaire.You are pazzo.Maybe, but I'vegot the tickets.Come on, I thoughtyou were fast.Aspetta!Wait! Wait!Hey, wait!We're passengers!Have you been throughthe inspection queue?Of course.Anyway, we don't have any lice.We're Americans. Both of us.Right.Come aboard.We're the luckiest sonsof bitches in the world.You know that?Goodbye!You know somebody?Of course not.That's not the point.Goodbye! I'll miss you!Goodbye!I will never forget you!Come with me,darling. Let's go.G.G. G.Excuse me, ma'am.G.Oh, right here.Hey, how you doing?Jack. Nice to meet you.Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.How you doing?Who says you get top bunk?This is your privatepromenade deck, sir.Will you be requiring anything?Excuse me. This one? No.It had a lot of faces on it.This is the one.Would you like all ofthem out, miss?Yes. We need a littlecolor in this room.Put in there. In the wardrobe.God, not those fingerpaintings again.They certainly were awaste of money.The difference betweenCal's taste in art...and mine is that I have some.They're fascinating.Like being inside a dreamor something.There's truth but no logic. What's the artist's name? Something Picasso.Something Picasso.He won't amount to a thing.He won't, trust me. Let's put the Degas in the bedroom. At least they were cheap.Put it in the wardrobe.At Cherbourg, a woman came aboardnamed Margaret Brown.We all called her Molly.History would call herthe Unsinkable Molly Brown.Well, I wasn't about towait all day for you, sonny.Here, if you thinkyou can manage.Her husband had struck goldsomeplace out west.And she was what Mothercalled ""new money.""By the next afternoon...we were steaming westfrom the coast of Ireland...with nothing out aheadof us but ocean.Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.Let's stretch her legs.Yes sir.All ahead full, Mr. Moody.Very good, sir.All ahead full.All ahead full!Come on lads, step lively!All right! Let's stokeher right up!We go full ahead!Come on, put yourbacks into it! knots, sir.Hey, look, look, look!See it?There's another one! See him?Look at that one!Look at him jump!I can see the Statueof Liberty already.Very small, of course.I'm the king of the world!She is the largest moving objectever made by the hand of man...in all history.And our master shipbuilder,Mr. Andrews here...designed her from thekeel plates up.I may have knockedher together, but...the idea was Mr. Ismay's.He envisioned a steamerso grand in scale...and so luxurious in...its appointments...that its supremacywould never be challenged.And here she is. Willed into solid reality. Hear, hear.I'll have the salmon.You know I don'tlike that, Rose.She knows.We'll both have the lamb.Rare, with verylittle mint sauce.You like lamb, right sweet pea?You gonna cut her meatfor her too there, Cal?Hey, who thought ofthe name Titanic?Was it you, Bruce?Yes, actually.I wanted to convey sheer size.And size means stability...luxury, and aboveall, strength.Do you know ofDr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?His ideas about the male preoccupation withsize might be of particular interest to you.What's gotten into you?Excuse me.I do apologize.She's a pistol, Cal.Hope you can handle her.Well, I may have to start minding what shereads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?Freud? Who is he?Is he a passenger?The ship is nice?Yeah. It's an Irish ship.Is English, no?No, it was built in Ireland., Irishmenbuilt this ship.Solid as a rock.Big Irish hands.That's typical.Firstclass dogscome down here to take a shite.Lets us know where we rankin the scheme of things.Like we could forget?I'm Tommy Ryan. Jack Dawson. Fabrizio.Do you make any moneywith your drawings?Forget it, boyo.You'd as like have angels fly out ofyour arse as get next to...the likes of her.I saw my whole lifeas if I'd already lived it.An endless paradeof parties and cotillions...yachts and polo matches.Always the same narrow people,the same mindless chatter.I felt like I was standingat a great precipice...with no one to pull me back.No one who cared...or even noticed.Don't do it.Stay back.Don't come any closer.Come on.Just give me your hand.I'll pull you back over.No! Stay where you are.I mean it.I'll let go.No, you won't.What do you mean, no I won't?Don't presume to tell mewhat I will and will not do.You don't know me.Well, you would have done it already.You're distracting me. Go away.I can't.I'm involved now.You let go, and I'm going to haveto jump in there after you.Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. I'm a good swimmer.The fall alone will kill you.It would hurt. I'm notsaying it wouldn't.Tell you the truth...I'm a lot more concernedabout that water being so cold.How cold?Freezing.Maybe a couple degrees over.You ever...ever been to Wisconsin?What?Well, they have some ofthe coldest winters around.I grew up there,near Chippewa Falls.I remember when I was a kid,me and my father, we went ice fishing...out on Lake Wissota.Ice fishing is, you know, where you...I know what ice fishing is!Sorry.You just seem like, you know,kind of an indoor girl.Anyway, I...fell through some thin ice.And I'm telling you...water that cold,like right down there...it hits you like  knivesstabbing you all over your body.You can't breathe.You can't think. Least not aboutanything but the pain.Which is why I'm not lookingforward to jumping in there after you.Like I said...I don't have a choice.I guess I'm kind of hoping you'llcome back over the rail and...and get me off the hook here.You're crazy.That's what everybody says but...with all due respect, miss...I'm not the one hanging offthe back of a ship here.Come on.Come on, give me your hand.You don't want to do this.I'm Jack Dawson.Rose DeWitt Bukater.I'll have to get you towrite that one down.Come on.I got you.Come on.Help, please!Help! Please, help me! Listen. Listen to me.Listen. Listen to me.I've got you. I won't let go.Now pull yourself up. Come on!Come on.That's right.You can do it.I got you.What's all this?You stand back and...don't move an inch!Fetch the Master at Arms.This is completely unacceptable!What made you think that you couldput your hands on my fiance?!Look at me, you filth!Cal.What do you thinkyou were doing?Cal, stop. It was an accident.An accident?It was.Stupid, really.I was leaning over and I slipped.I was leaning far overto see the...The... Propellers? Propellers, and I slipped.And I would have goneoverboard but Mr. Dawson here...saved me. And almostwent over himself.You wanted to see the...She wanted to see the propellers.Like I said, women andmachinery do not mix.Was that the way of it?Yeah. Yeah, thatwas pretty much it.Well, the boy's a hero then.Good for you, son. Well done.So, it's all's well and backto our brandy, eh?Look at you. You must be freezing.Let's get you inside.Perhaps a little somethingfor the boy?Of couMr. Lovejoy,I think a  should do it.Is that the going ratefor saving the woman you love?Rose is displeased.What to do?I know.Perhaps you could join us fordinner tomorrow evening...to regale our group...with your heroic tale.Sure. Count me in.Good. It's settled then.This should be interesting.Can I bum a smoke?You'll want to tie those.It's interesting...the young lady slippedso suddenly...and you still had time to removeyour jacket and your shoes.I know you've been melancholy.I don't pretend to know why.I intended to save this...until the engagementgala next week...but, I thought...tonight.Good gracious.Perhaps as a reminderof my feelings for you. Is it a... Diamond. Yes. carats to be exact.It was worn by Louis XVI.And they calledit Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.It's overwhelming.Well, it's for royalty.We are royalty, Rose.You know, there'snothing I couldn't give you.There's nothing I'd deny you...if you would not deny me.Open your heart to me, Rose.Well, I've been on my own sinceI was , since my folks died.And I had no brothers or sisters orclose kin in that part of the country...so I lit on out of there and Ihaven't been back since.You could just call me atumbleweed blowing in the wind.Well, Rose, we've walked about a milearound this boat deck and...chewed over how great the weather'sbeen and how I grew up...but I reckon that's not whyyou came to talk to me, is it? Mr. Dawson, I... Jack.Jack.I want to thank youfor what you did.Not just for pulling me back,but for your discretion.You're welcome.Look.I know what youmust be thinking.Poor little rich girl.What does she know about misery?No.No, that's not what I was thinking.What I was thinking was...what could have happened to this girlto make her think she had no way out?Well I...It was everything.It was my whole world and...all the people in it.And the inertia of my life,plunging ahead and me...powerless to stop it.God, look at that thing.You would have gonestraight to the bottom. invitations have gone out.All of Philadelphia society will be there.And all the while I feel I'm...standing in the middleof a crowded room...screaming at thetop of my lungs...and no one even looks up.Do you love him?Pardon me?Do you love him?You're being very rude. Youshouldn't be asking me this.Well, it's a simple question.Do you love the guy or not?This is not a suitable conversation.Why can't you justanswer the question?This is absurd.You don't know meand I don't know you...and we are not having thisconversation at all. You are rude...and uncouth and presumptuousand I am leaving now...Jack. Mr. Dawson.It's been a pleasure.I sought you out to thank youand now I have thanked you.And you've insulted me.Well, you deserved it. Right. Right.I thought you were leaving.I am.You are so annoying.Wait.I don't have to leave. This ismy part of the ship. You leave.Well, well, well.Now who's being rude?What is this stupid thingyou're carrying around?So, what are you,an artist or something?These are rather good.They're very good, actually.Jack, this is exquisite work.They didn't think toomuch of them in old Paree.Paris?You do get around for a p...Well, a... aperson of limited means.Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.Well, well, well.And these were drawn from life?Well, that's one of thegood things about Paris.Lots of girls are willingto take their clothes off.You liked this woman.You used her several times.Well.She had beautifulhands, you see?I think you must havehad a love affair with her.No, no, no.Just with her hands.She was aonelegged prostitute.See?She had a goodsense of humor though.Oh, and this lady...She used to sit at this bar every night...wearing every pieceof jewelry she owned...just waiting forher long, lost love.We called her Madame Bijoux.See, her clothes are all motheaten.Well, you have a gift, Jack.You do.You see people.I see you.And?You wouldn't have jumped.But the purpose of universityis to find a suitable husband.Rose has already done that.Look, here comes thatvulgar Brown woman.Quickly, get up beforeshe sits with us.Hello, girls. I was hopingI'd catch you at tea.We're awfully sorry,you missed it.The Countess and I were justoff to take the air on the boat deck.What a lovely idea.I need to catch up on my gossip.Countess.So, you've not yet lit thelast four boilers?No, I don't see the need.We are making excellent time.The press knows the size of Titanic.Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.We must give themsomething new to print.This maiden voyageof Titanic must...make headlines.Mr. Ismay, I would prefernot to push the engines...until they've been properly run in.Of course I'm just a passenger.I leave it to your good officesto decide what's best.But what a glorious endto your final crossing...if we were to get into New Yorkon Tuesday night...and surprise them all.Make the morning papers.Retire with a bang, eh, E. J?Good man.After that, I workedon a squid boat in Monterey...then I went to Los Angeles to the...Santa Monica pierand did portraits for  cents each.Why can't I be like you?Just head out for the horizonwhenever I feel like it.Say we'll go theresometime, to that pier...only if we just talk about it.No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.Ride on the roller coastertill we throw up.We'll ride horses on thebeach, in the surf.But you have to do it like a real cowboy.No sidesaddle stuff.You mean with one leg on each side?Can you show me?Sure, if you like.Teach me to ride like a man.Chew tobacco like a man.And spit like a man.You didn't learn in finishing school?No.Come on, I'll show you.I'll show you how.Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.I couldn't possibly, Jack.Watch closely.That's disgusting.Your turn.That was pitiful.You really have to hawk it back.Get some leverage.Use your arms. Arc your neck.You see the range on that thing?Okay, go.That was better. You have to work on it.Really try to hawk it up.Mother.May I introduce Jack Dawson?Charmed, I'm sure.The others were gracious and curiousabout the man who'd saved my life.But my mother looked at him like an insect.A dangerous insectwhich must be squashed quickly.Sounds like you're a good manto have around in a sticky spot.Why do they always insist on announcingdinner like a damn cavalry charge?Shall we go dress, Mother?See you at dinner, Jack.Son?Son!Do you have any idea what you're doing?Not really.You're about to go into the snake pit.What are you going to wear?I figured. Come on.I was right. You and my sonare just about the same size.Pretty close.You shine up like a new penny.Good evening, sir.Thousands of tons of Hockley steelare in this ship. Which part? All the right ones.Then you're accountableif there's a problem. Where's Rose?She'll be along.There is the Countess.I saw that in a nickelodeonand always wanted to do it.Darling...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.It's amazing.You could almost pass for a gentleman.Almost.This is extraordinary.This is a remarkable voyage. Mad. Completely lunatic.There's the Countess of Rothes.That's John Jacob Astor...the richest man on board.His little wifey, Madeleine,is my age and in a delicate condition.See how she tries to hide it.Quite the scandal.Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...is at home with the children, of course.And over here...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady DuffGordon.She designs naughty lingerie,among her many talents.Very popular with the royals.Congratulations. She's splendid.Why, thank you.Escort a lady to dinner?Certainly.Sweet pea, sweet pea.Ain't nothing to it.They love money. Pretend like you owna gold mine and you're in the club.Hey, Astor.Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.J.J., Madeleine,I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.Well, Jack...are you of the Boston Dawsons?No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.Oh, yes.He must have been nervous.But he never faltered.They assumed he was one of them.Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.New money, obviously,but still a member of the club.Mother. Of course.Could always be counted upon.Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.He was of help to my fiance last night.It hap Mr. Dawsonis quite a fine artist.He showed me some of his work today.Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.Not to impugn your work, sir.Are all these mine?Start from the outside and work in.He knows every rivet in her.Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.Thank you, Rose.How do you take your caviar, sir?No caviar for me, thanks.Never did like it much.Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.After that, I'm on God's good humor.How do you have means to travel?I work my way from place to place.Tramp steamers and such.I won my ticket on Titanicat a lucky hand at poker.A very lucky hand.All life is a game of luck.A real man makes his own luck.Right, Dawson?And you findthat sort of rootless existence appealing?Yes, ma'am, I do.I've got everything I needright here with me.I have air in my lungsand blank sheets of paper.I love waking up, not knowingwhat will happen or who I'll meet.Where I'll wind up.One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...now I'm on the grandest shipin the world, with you fine people.I'll take more of that.Life's a gift. I don'tintend on wasting it.You never know what hand you'll get dealt.You take life as it comes at you.Here, Cal.Make each day count.Well said, Jack.Hear, hear.To making it count.Bravo.But Mr. Brown didn't knowI'd hidden the money in the stove.He comes home drunk as a pig celebratingand lights a fire.Next is brandy in the smoking room.Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?Now they retreat to congratulate eachother on being masters of the universe.Ladies, thank you for your company.May I escort you to the cabin?No, I'll stay here.Here, Molly.Joining us, Dawson?You don't want to stay with the women.No, thanks. I have to head back.That's best. It'll be all business and politics.Wouldn't interest you.But Dawson, good of you to come.Must you go?Time for me to row with the other slaves.Good night, Rose.Want to go to a real party?Is okay I put my hand here?I can't understand you.I'm going to dance with her now.Come on.Come on. Come with me.Jack. Jack, wait.I can't do this.We'll have to get a bit closer.Like this.You're still my best girl, Cora. I don't know the steps. Me, either. Just go with it.Don't think.Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!What? Wait!Jack, no.Beyond the jurisdictionof the Sherman Act.That's what Rockefeller said...Supreme Court didn't swallow it.What? You thinka firstclass girl can't drink?Get out of here.Are you all right?I'm fine.Two out of three.So...you think you're tough?Let's see you do this.Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.Jesus!You okay?I haven't done that in years.Come on, lads. Give it all you got.Let's go.Coffee, sir?You didn't come to me last night.I was tired.Your exertions below deckwere no doubt exhausting.I see you hadthat undertaker of a manservant follow me.You will never behave like that again.I'm not one of your mill foremenwho you can command.I'm your fiance.My fiance. My fiance!Yes, you are! And my wife!My wife in practice,if not yet by law, so you will honor me!You will honor me the waya wife honors her use I will not be made a fool of.Is this in any way unclear?No.Good. Excuse me.Oh, Miss Rose.We had a little accident. That's all right. I'm sorry.Let me help you.It's all right, miss.Tea, Trudy.You're not to see that boy again.You understand?Rose, I forbid it.Stop it, Mother.You'll give yourself a nosebleed.This is not a game.Our situation is precarious.You know the money's gone.Of course I know.You remind me every day.Your father left us nothing but a legacyof bad debts hidden by a good name.That name is the only card we have to play.I don't understand you.It is a fine match with Hockley.It will ensure our survival.How can you put this on me?Why are you being so selfish?I'm being selfish?Do you want to see meworking as a seamstress?Is that what you want?To see our fine things sold at auction?Our memories scattered?It's so unfair.Of course it's unfair.We're women.Our choices are never easy.Protect them by Thy guiding handFrom every peril on the landO, spirit whom the Father sentTo spread abroad the firmamentO, wind of heaven, by Thy mightSave all who dare the eagle's flightAnd keep them by Thy watchful care...Hello, Mr. Andrews.I need to talk to someone.You're not supposed to be in here.I was here last night, remember?No. Now please turn around.He'll tell you. I just need to talk...Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater...are still appreciativeof your assistance.They asked meto give you this in gratitude...I don't want your money.And remind you you arein third class and your presence here...is no longer appropriate.Let me speak to Rose.Gentlemen, please see Mr. Dawsonreturns to where he belongs...and that he stays there?Yes, sir.Come along, you.Hear us when we cry to TheeFor those in peril on the seaWhy are there two steering wheels?We use this one near shore.Excuse me, sir.Another ice warning, from the Noordam.Thank you, Sparks.Not to worry.Quite normal for this time of year.In fact, we're speeding up.I've ordered the last boilers lit.Okay, son, wind it up tightlike I showed you. That's right.Okay, now let it go. It was good, wasn't it? Quite nice. That's excellent.Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.I did the sum in my head...and with the number of lifeboatstimes the capacity you mentioned...Forgive me, but it seems that there arenot enough for everyone aboard.About half, actually.Rose, you miss nothing, do you?In fact, I put in these newtype davits...which can take an extra rowof boats inside this one.But it was thought, by some...the deck would looktoo cluttered.So, I was overruled.It's a waste of deck spaceas it is on an unsinkable ship.Sleep soundly, young Rose.I have built you a good ship,strong and true.She's all the lifeboatyou need.Just keep heading aft. The nextstop will be the engine room.Jack, this is impossible.I can't see you. I need to talk to you. No, Jack. No.Jack. I'm engaged.I'm marrying Cal.I love Cal.Rose...you're no picnic. All right?You're a spoiled little brat even.But under that, you're themost amazingly, astounding...wonderful girl...woman, that I've ever known.Jack, I...No, let me try and getthis out. You're ama...I'm not an idiot.I know how the world works.I've got ten bucksin my pocket.I have nothing to offeryou and I know that.I understand.But I'm too involved now.You jump, I jump. Remember?I can't turn away withoutknowing you'll be all right.That's all that I want.Well, I'm fine.I'll be fine. Really.Really?I don't think so.They've got you trapped, Rose.And you're gonna die if youdon't break free.Maybe not right away...because you're strong...but sooner or later thatfire that I love about you, Rose...that fire is gonna burn out.It's not up to youto save me, Jack.You're right.Only you can do that.I'm going back.Leave me alone.Tell Lucile about the disasteryou had with the stationers.Well, of course the invitationshad to be sent back, twice.Oh, my dear.And the dreadfulbridesmaids' gowns.Let me tell you what anodyssey that has been.Rose decided shewanted lavender.She knows I detest the color.So, she did it only to spite me.If only you'd come tome sooner",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ruth saw some of my designs inLa Mode Illustre.They were for the trousseau of the Duchessof Marlborough's youngest daughter.They were quite charming, I think you'll agree,my dear, that together...we've created somethingof a phoenix from the ashes.Hello, Jack.I changed my mind.They said you might be up here.Give me your hand.Now close your eyes.Go on.Now, step up.Now, hold onto the railing.Keep your eyes closed.Don't peek.I'm not.Now, step up onto the rail.Hold on.

Will this light do? What?Don't artists need good light?That is true, but I'm notused to working in...such horrible conditions.Monet! Do you know his work? Of course.Look at his use of color here.Isn't he great?I know.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon",tt0190332,2001,Oscar,"Master Li is here!Master Li is here!Master Li is here!Shu Lien!Shu Lien! Li Mu Bai is here!Master Li.Hello.How's everything?Fine. Please come in.Li Mu Bai. It's been a long time.It has.How's business?Not bad. And how are you?Fine.Monk Zheng came byfrom the Wudang Mountain.He said you were practicingdeep meditation.The mountain must be so peaceful.I envy you.My work keeps me so busyI hardly get a minute's rest.I broke it off.I couldn't complete the training.Why? You're a Wudang fighter.Training is everything.During my meditation training,I came to a place of deep silence.I was surrounded by light.Time and space disappeared.I felt I had come to a placemy master had never told me about.You were enlightened.Far from it.I didn't feel the blissone should feel when enlightened.Instead, I was surroundedby an endless sorrow.It was more than I could take.I couldn't go on. I failed.There was something pulling meback into the world.What was it?Something I can't seem to let go of.I see you're preparing to leave.We're making a delivery to Beijing.Perhaps I could ask youto deliver something to Sir Te for me.The Green Destiny Sword?You're giving it to Sir Te?I am. He has always beenour greatest protector.I don't understand.How can you part with it?It's been with you a long time.Too many men have died at its edge.It may look purebut only because bloodwashes easily from its blade.You use it for good cause,making you worthy of it.It's time for me to leave it behind.So what will you do then?Come with me to Beijing.You can give the sword to Sir Te in person.It'll be just like old times.I need to visit my master's grave.It's been many years sincehe was murdered by Jade Fox.I have yet to avenge his death,and yet I'm thinking of quitting.I must pray for his forgiveness.Catch up with me when you have finished.I will wait for you if you come.Maybe.Okay, you may pass.Thanks.Let's go into the city. We can restafter we unload the shipment.Thank God everything is safe.Much obliged, Miss Yu.Just doing my job.Sun Security has been the bestsince your father started it.You're a credit to your father's memory.Thank you.It's the truth.This is Li's personal sword.A great hero is worthy of a great weapon.He is the only one in the worldworthy of it.It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.The sword has brought Li Mu Baias much trouble as glory.Li wants to leave these troubles behind.Take the sword and help himleave his old way of life.I see. All right.I'll act as the sword's custodian.Ninth Level Counsel, Chief Yu has arrived.I must change.Thank you. You've always beena great friend to Li and me.No hurry to leave. Please feel at home.You'll stay the night as my guest.Now, Shu Lien,tell me something,and forgive me for prying.But your father was like a brother to meand I think of you as my own daughter.Please, Sir Te, what is it?Li Mu Bai giving up his swordand his warrior days,maybe he's hinting something to you.I don't know.Don't be coy.I've known all along aboutyour feelings for each other.Neither of you have been brave enoughto reveal your feelings to each other.So many years went wasted.Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.Maybe it isn't what you've thought.When it comes to emotions,even great heroes can be idiots.If Li Mu Bai doesn't talk straightnext time you see him,let me know, and I'll give him an earful!You will stay in this room.You?I am your guest here today.This is Sir Te's study. You are here to...It's so crowded out there.I was looking for a quiet place.I'm Sir Te's head servant, De Lu.This is another of our guests.It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal.It's the handle that's heavy.And that blade is no ordinary metal.Still, the sword is the lightestof all weapons.You find it heavy becauseyou're not used to handling them.No, I've had a lotof experience with weapons.My father has security guardsliving with us.They let me play with their weapons.This scabbard is so beautiful.Beautiful and yet dangerous.Once you've seen it tainted with blood,you'll think otherwise.It's  years old.It's exquisite.You said this sword belongs to...My friend Li Mu Bai.He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior?I've heard so much about him.Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?It's a long story.You must be a sword fighter, too.Yes, but I prefer the machete.This sword fits Li Mu Bai perfectly.Really.It must be exciting to be a fighter.Fighters have rules, too.Friendship, trust, integrity.Always keep your promise.Without rules, we wouldn't survive long.I've read all about people like you.Roaming wild,beating up anyone who gets in your way!Writers have to write like thatto sell books.You're just like the charactersin the stories.Sure, no place to bathe for days,sleeping on fleainfested beds.They tell you all about that in those books?You know what I mean.I'm getting married soon,but I haven't lived the life I want.I've heard of your engagement.Congratulations.It's the most important stepin a woman's life, isn't it?You are not married, are you?What do you think?No. You couldn't roam aroundfreely if you were.I admit you're probably right.Chief Yu, take a look. feet  inches long, . inch wide.The handle is  inch long, . inches wide,. inch thick, each side is . inches.With seven rubies missing from the hilt.You can tell from the design thatit was made during the Qin Wu era.Engraved with a technique lostduring the Han Dynasty.Your knowledge is remarkable.A sword by itself rules nothing.It comes alive only throughskilful manipulation.I see your point. Please continue, Sir Te.The inner city in Beijing is not a problem.With royalty and officials everywherethe Royal Guard keep security tight.But the outer city is hard to govern.It's full of complex characters.Proceed with cautionin your quest for law and order.Don't depend only on the court.Keep some contactsin the Jiang Hu underworld.It can ensure your position.Be strong yet supple.This is the way to rule.Governess.Let me do it.Please sit.I've made a pair of silk pajamas.Want to change into them?Leave them there.I heard you met Yu Shu Lien today.You know her?Your mother would not want youconsorting with her kind.I'll socialize with whomever I please.Don't invite dangerinto your father's house.I'm tired now!Go to bed then.You've grown upand will get married soon.God knows what the future will bring.It'll be just the same.Enough, I'm tired.It's autumn now.I'll shut the windows for you.Chilly, eh?Thief!Someone help! Catch the thief!He's on the rooftop!The sword's been stolen! Someone help!He's on the roof! Stop, thief!Catch him!Avenge my mother!What are you standing here for?Go get him!Return the sword, and I'll let you go.You've been trained at Wudang?We are street performers. You're wrong.We're just practicing the stunts.Let's go.Practicing? Who are you trying to fool?Where did they go?Chief Yu's house.Get down here!Give me the sword.Sir Te awaits you in the great hall.I didn't get the sword back.But I'm sure the thief's connectedto the Yus.How dare you!But I saw...Enough! Get out!Has Chief Yu ever seen the sword?Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.But the sword is somewherein his compound.Then someone's out to frame him.We should get wordto Li Mu Bai about this.Watch your step.What is it?Someone's put fliers up.Let me see.Someone's after Jade Fox.Preposterous, looking for her here!Best spear fighting in the world!The Yang School of Spear Fighting!Where did they go?I really don't know.I saw them couple of days ago.Probably gone by now.Miss, there's a Miss Yu hereasking to see you.Our Lady is busy right now.I will tell her then.Show her in.Yes.This spells trouble.I have a guest now.This way please, Miss Yu.I've missed you!Missed me? How so?I have nothing to do.You're practicing calligraphy.I'll write your name. Just for fun.I never noticed that my namelooks like the word for sword.You write gracefully.Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.Maybe it is. I wouldn't know.Please.Thank you for seeing me.I hear your wedding day is near.You must be overwhelmedwith the preparations.I'm hardly doing a thing.The less I think of it, the better.My parents are arranging everything,including the groom.Mother says the Gousare a very powerful family.My marrying into this familywill give my dad's career a big boost.It's a great fortune to marryinto such a noble family.Is it? Actually,I like the great heroes in the booksjust like you and Li Mu Bai.Marriage is a good thing.If only I could be free to live my own life,to choose who I loveand love him in my own way.That's real happiness.Think so? Let me tell you a story.About you and Li Mu Bai?Yes. I was once engagedto be married when I was young.Really?His name was Meng Si Zhao.He was a brotherbyoath to Li Mu Bai.One day,while defending Li Mu Bai in battlehe was killed by another man's sword.After Meng's sacrifice,Li and I went through a lot together.Our feelings for each other grew stronger.But we decided to honormy engagement to Meng.The freedom you talk about,I too desire it,but I've never tasted it.It's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.Too bad for Meng,but that's just the way things turn out.As a woman,I still must abide by traditioneven if I'm not an aristocrat like you.Don't distance us.From now on, let's be sisters.All right. As a sister,I hope you find real happiness.Miles and miles of nothing.Can't your father get an appointmentcloser to civilization?This place!Jen, are you listening to me?Let's go!Who are you?Dad!Hold it! I'm a friend!I don't care about your sword.Why are you spying on the Yus?I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox.I'm a police inspectorfrom the Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.This Jade Fox is a master criminal.I hear she infiltrated the Yus.She must have come with themwhen he transferred here.But I cannot just go in and catch her there.I have to lure her out.This Jade Fox is a woman?You bet.Then leave her to me. Don't worry.Thank you, but I doubt you can handle her.My wife used to be quite a martial artist.Jade Fox killed her.It's both an official and a personal matterto me.Meatballs are ready!I'm more than ready for them.Wait, dad gets first dip!Hey!They are gone.What does it say?We'll settle this at midnight tonighton Cemetery Hill.Good! The Fox is out of her hole.Please.Shu Lien, look who's here.Sir Te thinks it's not appropriateto cast doubt on Chief Yu.But there is something upin the Yu household. I'm investigating.What have you found?Jade Fox? Impossible!You'd always suspectedshe'd fled out west.She has the nerve to come to Beijing.Is there any place safer thanunder the nose of Chief Yu?I shall avenge my master's death after all.But be careful, Li Mu Bai.Sir Te requires discretion.Official business is alreadydifficult to resolve,it'd be a bigger messwith your personal matters involved.And I don't know,this flyer may not be reliable.It could be some sort of trap.Did you see who posted it?No.It says Fox is hiding at Yu's.Sir Te says the night of the theftthere was a brawl in front of Yu's.Were you involved?No, that was Bo, Sir Te's man.Bo followed the thief to the Yus.Have you crossexamined him yet?Bo? No, not yet...But you've had your menstake out Yu's compound?No, I'd already sent them back.You can blame me for losing the swordbut trust me, I'll get it back soonusing my own methods.That's not what I meant.I don't care about the sword.How can you say that?Didn't you come back here for it?I didn't know it was stolen until I got here.Then, why did you come?Well, we had talked...Pardon my intrusion.Master Li, your room is ready.Thank you.Please, lead the way.This Fox doesn't care much for punctuality.There's no sign of her.Enough! Don't pretend any more.Tsai! You old scoundrel!You won't leave me alone. Payback time!Yeah, old lady? Watch your mouth!If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.If you resist, you're dead today.Dad! Let me avenge my mother's death.You'll end up like her, you little whore!You old fox!Dad!You old fox, you ruined my life.You won't get away with it.Watch out for her acupressure!Sue!Tsai, you dog!You even have hidden hands!Dad, are you okay?I'm fine.Wudang should have gotten rid of youlong ago.It's been a long time, Jade Fox!You probably don't remember me.But you remember my master.You infiltrated my clan while I was away.You poisoned my masterand stole the secret manual.Now it's time for you to pay!Your master underestimated us women.He wouldn't teach me even afterhe'd slept with me.He deserved to die by a woman's hands!You stole the top secretsof Wudang's martial arts.But you've mastered onlythe basic moves in the past ten years.For you to die under Wudang'ssword todayis no disgrace!My disciple! Fight with me!We'll kill them all!Fox has a disciple!I've got to get rid of Tsai!Who are you?Why is the Green Destiny Swordin your possession?It's none of your business.My name is Li Mu Bai.The Green Destiny Sword is mine.Jade Fox can't be your master.Where did you learn this ""Xuan Piu"" move?Piece of cake.Who is your master?Let's go.I'll kill them once and for all.Let's go!Dad!Dad!Dad!This is Tsai?My father. Police Inspector from Shaan.Homicide must be reported to Chief Yu.In addition, the victim is an officer.You believe the killer is hiding outin this compound?I'd put my life on it, sir.Come with me.This needs to be resolved, and quickly.I'll get into the Yu household and get her.I'll ferret out this Foxand her gang in no time.Too dangerous. Yu is a court officialand in charge of security.This could ruin his reputation and career.It might also get Sir Te in trouble.This calls for the utmost delicacy.Sir Te, can you find some excuseto invite Mrs. and Miss Yu over?What do you have in mind?The best way to trap a foxis through her cubs.Oh, my! Mrs. Te is spoiling uswith all these gifts.She is being so considerateto our daughter.I'm sorry she's not feeling well enoughto entertain you today.I heard Sir Te has lost something.And now Mrs. Te is not feeling well.We know who stole the missing item.If the thief returns itI'm sure Sir Te will pursuethe matter no further.That's good.It's a real annoyance to haveservants who steal.Sir Te knows that even wellmeaningpeople sometimes make mistakes.Some mistakes can ruinnot only themselvesbut their entire family as well.But don't be too lenient.Sure. For example,no mercy will be shown to the murdererwho just turned up in Beijing.A murderer?Yes,the very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.Last night she killed a policemanwho had tracked her for many years.A female criminal! Now that's news!You say she killed a policeman?Yes, from the west.He went undercover as a street performer,and followed her here.I'm no detective, but maybethe murderer and thief are the same.I doubt that.This particular thief is very unusual.And most likely smarter than a mere killer.Greetings, Sir Te.Hello, Mrs. Yu.Let me introduce Li Mu Bai,the renowned swordsman.It's a pleasure to meet you,Mrs. Yu, Ms Yu.Ms Yu is getting married soon.Congratulations.Why don't you come in?I'm standing guard.Come in. It's cold.Come in. We don't have to fearJade Fox if we're together.Isn't it a little late to be out?You can give the sword to me.I'll do as I please.Where's your master?None of your business!Had enough flying?You've got potential.But you've misunderstoodWudang's secret manual quite a bit.You need a real master.A master like you? It's a meaningless title.You're right, it's all meaningless.School is meaningless,the secret manual is meaninglesseven this sword.It is just a state of mind.Don't talk like a monkjust because you're in a temple. Just fight!Then tell me where Jade Fox is!Move!True strength is light as a feather.No assistance, no growth.No reaction, no explanation.No control, no desire.Give yourself up and find yourself again.Here's a lesson for you on life.Go ahead.Why should I? You need practice.Learn to defeat movement with stillness.That way you'll be worthyof the Green Destiny.Why do you want to teach me?I've always wanted a discipleworthy of the Wudang secrets.Aren't you afraid that I'd kill youonce I mastered it?That's a risk I'm willing to takeas your teacher.Deep down you're good. Even Jade Foxhasn't been able to corrupt you.Wudang is a whorehouse!Keep your lessons to yourself!You're home late, or should I say early?Why are you still here?You've killed a policeman!You'll bring ruin on my whole family.They wouldn't have tracked me hereif you hadn't stolen the sword.You're not a little girl any more.You thought this would be fun?I'm in this, and you're in too.Come with me, Jen.You don't want to waste your lifeas the wife of some pompous bureaucrat.As master and disciple, we will rule.I'll never live as a thief.You're already the most wanted thief!That was just for fun.Why would I leave, and where?Wherever we want.We'd get rid of anyone in our way.Even your father.Shut up!That's the underworld fighter lifestyle.Kill or be killed.Exciting, isn't it?I've fulfilled my obligations to you.No, I have.To have you as my discipleis the thing in my life I'm most proud of.You think you've been teaching meall these years from the manual?Thank goodness you're illiterate.I studied the illustrations,and you studied the words.You hid the details from me?You wouldn't have understood iteven if you knew how to read.You know you've goneas far as you will go.I hid my skills from you becauseI was afraid you might get hurt.If it weren't for seeing you fightwith Li Mu Bai,I'd still be ignorantof all you've hidden from me.Governess.I started learning from youin secret when I was .You enchanted me with the dreamof the Jiang Hu underworld.But once I realized I could exceed you,you can't imagine how frightened I was!I had no one to guide me,no one to follow,no one to learn from.There will be morefrightening things ahead.Are you happy now that the sword is back?I admit, getting it back made me realizehow much I missed it.But it's not your sword any more, is it?You gave it to Sir Te.True. But I must borrow it for one last job.Jade Fox will die on its edge.Did you know what you were hidingwhen you covered for that girl?My job was to recover the swordwithout embarrassing anyone.I wasn't about to ruin her life,or her father.You did your job well.The sword is back. But...this girl.I saw her last night.I knew you'd be suspicious.She needs controlling.She needs real direction and training.She's an aristocrat's daughter,she's not one of us.It will all be over soon.You'll kill Fox and she'll marry.That's not her.She should become a Wudang disciple.But Wudang doesn't accept women.For her, perhaps they could makean exception.If not, left to her own, I'm afraidshe'll become a poisonous dragon.It's not our affair.Even if Wudang accepts her,her husband might object.I thought by giving away the sword,I could escape the Jiang Hu world.But the cycle of bloodshed continues.I had hoped so, too.I wish there were somethingI could do to help you.Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.Freeze!Lo!Jen!You shouldn't have come.With all the trafficon your rooftop these daysit took me a while to get in here.I can't wait any longer, Jen.I was wrong to let you go.Come with me, back to the desert.You'll be happy there.You can do whatever you want.You have been looking for me all this time?Jen, stop playing with it.I won't break it.Charge!Stop!It's Dark Cloud!Dark Cloud is coming!Lower the shade, don't be seen!Don't be afraid, Miss.Don't touch the women!Come!Hey!Your mother is fine.Hurry back to your mother.Hey!She's mine! Leave her to me!Let's take a break.Give me back my comb!Take a break.You're tired. You need rest.Your horse needs water.There's a spring up here.Well, there was when I last visited.Your name?My name is Lo.The Hans call me Dark Cloud.I'm not that tall or that big,but I'm quick as lightning.HereGive me my comb.If you like that, I can make you a bow.Great for hunting pheasants.They're delicious.You need to eat something. Understand?That way, you'll have the strength to fight.Understand?You'll slowly regain your strength.Don't rush.You have a bad temper.It's much better this way.You coward!Still in a bad mood? But you're speaking.What's your name?I didn't think the Hans had names like that.Relax. If I wanted to do what you thinkI want to do, I'd have done it already.You must be dying for a bath.The water source is far,and difficult to get to.I managed to bring back some fresh water.You can wear my clotheswhen you are done.They're clean.Don't worry.I'll sing a song, so you'll know where I am.After the bath, you will calm down a little.But promise me,no more rocks on the head.All this trouble, just for a comb?It's mine.And it's worth a lot to me.But to a barbarian like you, it's nothing.Not true. I can use itto pick fleas from my horse.By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.I'm sorry, I guessed wrong.I thought you were a Han.Give me back my comb.I don't take orders from anyone.Give it to me.One night, when I was a boyI saw a thousand stars fall out of the sky.I remember thinking,where did they all go?I'm an orphan.I used to look for stars alone.Maybe if I rode to the other endof the desert, I'd find them.I've been riding in the desert ever since.And that little boy becamea fearsome bandit.Couldn't find the stars,so now he steals my comb.Out there,you're always fighting for survival.You have to gang upjust to stand a chance.Slowly, your gang becomes your family.All that Dark Cloud stuffis just propagandabut it does make my life easier.So you are still the little boy at heartlooking for fallen stars.I am a man. And I've foundthe brightest star of them all.Your father's men are looking for you.They're still out there, circling closer.Let them look.They'll keep looking. It's trouble for me.Don't even think of sending me back.It's up to you.You might get tired of thisand start missing your family.If we had a daughter,we'd look for her, too.She'd miss us, too.Jen, I want you to be mine forever.What if I make my mark on the world,earn your parents' respect?We have a legend. Anyone who daresto jump from the mountain,God will fulfill a wish of his.A long time ago, a man's parents were ill,so he jumped.He didn't die, wasn't even wounded.He just floated away, far away,never to return.He knew his wish had come true.If you believe in it, it will happen.I've asked Han people, they say,""A sincere heart will makeyour dreams come true.""Keep it safe.And return it to mewhen we are together again.I will.If you don't return it to me,I will have to chase you down.And next time, I won't go easy on you.Wherever I went,they always recognized me.I really tried.I heard you came to Beijing.I was afraid I'd never see you again.So I came.I can't let you get married like that.Go back.Jen.Don't ever come back.This is it?Yes.We heard noises. Is everything all right?Fine. It was just a cat.You think Jade Fox will show up?She must be nearby.But I doubt she'll show herself.We'll keep our eyes open.She'll come for the girl sooner or later.Jen!Go back to Xin Jiang with me.Let go of me.You're mine.Go back to Xin Jiang with me.Jen, come back to Xin Jiang with me.Tell me. Where is Jade Fox?Come with me. Hurry.You really thought she'd give it all upand go back west with you?She's mine.Whether she's yours or notyou will be no good to her dead.With Gou and Yu hunting you,it won't be long untilyou're in their hands.I don't care anymore.If you truly loved her,you wouldn't say that.Don't you want to see her again?I'll write an introduction for you.Take it to Wudang Mountain.Wait there for news from me.Okay.When will this end?They take it, put it back, and take it again.My place is no better than a warehouse.Come in.Speak.Jen Yu's run away.The groom found her missing.Chief Yu requests your assistancesince you knowthe Jiang Hu underworld so well.He wants to find herand keep her from harm.Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry.What can I serve you?This cup is dirty.Hi there. May I ask your name?Long.It's young master Long. My apologies!I'm Iron Eagle Sung.This is my fellow brother,Flying Cougar Li Yun.What brings you to Huai Anand where are you headed, Master Long?Anywhere there's action.In that case,perhaps we could be of assistance.Don't bother.You don't seem to be getting our drift.So what if I don't?We have ways of dealing with peoplewho don't get it.Are you related to Li Mu Bai?He's my defeated foe.Some tea.Shu Lien.There's no eternityto the things we can touch.My master used to say,""There's nothing we can hold ontoin this world.""Only by letting go can wefinally possess what is real.""Even to an old Taoist like you,not everything is an illusion.When you were holding my hand just now,wasn't that real?Your hand is cold and callusedfrom practicing machetes.All these years,and I've never had the courage to touch it.Crouching tigers and hidden dragonsare in the underworldbut so are human feelings.Swords and knives harbor unknownperils, but so do human relationships.I gave away the Green Destinywith sincerity.But it brought us more troubles.Repressing your feelingswill only make them stronger.I can't repress my desire.I want to be with you.Just sitting like thisgives me a sense of peace.Please follow me.I want a clean room.There are plenty of rooms.What would you like to eat?Some steamed cod, fried ribs,meatballs, not too big, with little starch!And cabbage soup with shark fins,plus a bottle of warm rose wine.I have to order them froma bigger restaurant.Hurry then.Yes.It's him.I am Iron Arm Mi.I heard a true master has arrived.I have come to seek a lesson.You asked for it!What kind of Iron Arm are you?That's amazing technique!I am Flying Machete.Are you related to Southern Crane?Southern Duck?I don't eat anything with two feet.Who could remember such lengthy names?You!If Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe,why don't you know his master?Who are you?I'm Phoenix Mountain Gou.Gou? I hate that name.I feel like throwing upwhen I hear that name.Too bad you're named Gou!You'll be the first to taste my sword today.Hold it! Don't you know Monk Jing?A monk eating meat and not readingscriptures? You need a lesson, too.Who the hell are you?I am...I am...Be careful of her sword!...the invincible Sword Goddesswith the Green Destinythat has no equalbe it Li or Southern Eagle.Lower your head and ask for mercy!I'm the dragon from the desertwith no trace to be discoveredin my wake.Today I fly over EhMei Mountain,tomorrow, I'll uprootthe last dregs of Wudang!We politely asked for a friendly match,but she showed no respectand started to reproach and attack us.My friends offered to come byand teach her a lesson.Her sword is just too powerful.I've travelled far and wide,but I've never met anyone that uncivilized.She kept accusing me of beingthe brother of Gou Jun Pei.Who is this guy Gou, anyway?Her husband.Sun Security is nearby. Why don't yougo home and see how things are going?What about you?I'll look around and catch up later.Not a bad idea.Let's stay at Sun Security tonight.Get a good night's sleep.Yes.You are back.Yes.You're back, Master!Hello guys. How's home?Things are fine.You've been gone a while.Something came up. I leave tomorrow.Wei, your wife was due?Yes, a baby girl.A girl? Good.I'd be happy if she grows up like you.Mrs. Wu.You're back!How's the arm? Still sore?Much better.I've been worried about you.Mrs. Wu,Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.Really? I'll go and tidy up the room then.Sister Yu!You came to find me.Let's find you some proper clothes.I'm just borrowing them.I'm not moving in.You get around pretty well.I don't think you need my clothes.I just happened to be around.I wanted to see how you're doing.Sister...Now, now.With all the trouble you've caused,now you know what Jiang Hu lifeis really like.You came here,that means you think of me as your sister.If so, let me give you some sisterly advice.You don't have to marry,you can't just leave your parents.But they're the oneswho forced me to get married.Go back to your parents first.Then you can decide about Lo.You know about Lo?He really loves you.Come back to Beijing with me.We'll figure a way out for you.Where is he now?Li Mu Bai has made arrangements.Li Mu Bai?He sent him to Wudang Mountain.So, you're all working togetherto set me up.Shut up! How dare you accuse us!From the beginning,I knew you stole the Green Destiny!I've done nothing but protect youand your family.And you've repaid mewith nothing but contempt.Li Mu Bai spared you,and all you do is insult him.All we hoped for was a little peace,and you've ruined it for us!You're no sister of mine!I don't give a damn.Friendship is not real anyway.But I wonder,how long could you last as my enemy?Put the sword down.Jen!Everyone out. Shut the doors.Fine. No more friendship.That's Li Mu Bai's sword.Come and get it if you can.You just rely on the Green Destinyto do your fighting.Don't blame the weaponif you can't fight me.Go ahead. Take your pick.I'll wait.Go ahead.Give me the sword.Take it!Stop!You are not worthy of this sword.Not another lecture! On guard!Stop yourself before I do.Now the sword will settle it.I didn't force you at the monasterybecause I wanted to see the real you.What do you know about seeinga true heart?Why can't you leave me alone?I'll say it again,let me teach you.Okay, if you can take back the swordin three movesI will go with you.Give it back.Greet your master.You wish.Then the sword is useless.It's only a matter of time beforethose guys get their revenge.Your parents value their reputation.They'll never take you back.What good's a home? You've gone so far.Now we can go all the way together.You'll always be my Lady.After all, happiness is the mostimportant thing in life, isn't it?We'll be our own masters at last.All we have left is each other, isn't that so?Now lie down and rest.Crazy girl like that,you should have killed her.I didn't have the heart to do it.Maybe Li Mu Bai can do it.Is it me or the sword you want?You've been drugged.Where's Jade Fox?What's going on?Jade Fox drugged her.How did you get here?We followed Jade Fox.Watch out!Watch out!Governess!This is the end of the road.For you too.A poisoned needle!You deserve to diebut I was reallyaiming at Jen.Ten years I sacrificedbut you deceived me.You hid the book's true meaning.I never improvedbut your progress was limitless.You know what poison is?An eightyearold girl who's full of deceit!That's poison!Jen!My only love,my only enemy!You can't die! Tell us,what poison did you use?What poison?You can't die, tell us the antidote!You can't let him die! Li Mu Bai can't die!It's the Purple Yin Poison.What?Purple Yin Poison.It goes straight to the heart.My blood will stop flowingwithin two hours.It's the same poison that killed my master.There's no antidote.There must be an antidote!Every living thing has its antithesis.And not this?There is. Fox taught it to me.The recipe isn't complicated, but theingredients are hard to find. It takes time.Please, trust me.As you have helped me, let me help him.All right. Hurry up.Maybe I can hold on for two hours.Ride my horse to headquarters.They have the ingredients.Give this to Mrs. Wu.She'll help you. Hurry!Save your breath.Guard your energy. I'll be back.Who is this?Mrs. Wu! Where's Mrs. Wu?Stop it!Yu gave me thisand told me to come to you.Let her come in!Mu Bai, hold on.Give me some hope.Shu Lien.Don't waste your breath.My life is departing.I've only one breath left.Use your last bit of strength to meditate.Free yourself from this worldas you've been taught.Let your soul rise to eternitywith your last breath.Don't waste it on me.I've already wasted my whole life.I want to tell youwith my remaining strengththat I love you. I always have.I'll drift next to you everyday as a ghostjust to be with you.Even if I was banishedto the darkest place,my lovewill keep me from being a lonely spirit.He's gone?Bo,please take this sword back to Sir Te's.You may go to Wudang Mountain.Lo awaits you there.Promise me whatever pathyou decide to take in this life,be true to yourself.Jen!Jen.Remember the storyyou told me in the desert?Have faith, then the dreams will come true.Make a wish, Lo.I wish that we'll be in the desert,together again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smith has been assuming controlof organized crime in Los Angeles.This includes the assassinationsof Mickey Cohen lieutenants......the systematic blackmailof city officials......and the murders of Susan Lefferts",Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens......and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.Captain Smith admitted as much to me......before I shot him......at the Victory Motel.That's it.The press will have a field day.Christ!It'll stain the Department for years.Decades.If we can get the kid to play ball......who's to say what happened?Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero. Good idea. If we get the press to play.Want to tell me whatyou're smiling about?A hero.How'd he know what we said?He couldn't have heard us.In this situation......you'll need more than one.It is my pleasure to present this awardto Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley...... twotime Medal of Valor recipient.Next year the LAPDwill move into its new facility.With leaders like Edmund Exley......the image of fat cops stealing appleswill be left behind......and Los Angeles will finallyhave the police force it deserves.You just couldn't resist.They're using me.So for a while, I'm using them.Come on.Thanks for the push.Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.Some men get the world......others get exhookersand a trip to Arizona.Subtitled by:GELULA & CO.," INC.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...the second most highly regardedProust scholar in the U.S. Who's number one? That would be me, Rich. Really? Mmhmm.So that's when.No. What happened wasI was a bit upset...so I said some thingsthat I shouldn't have said...and I did some thingsthat I shouldn't have done...and subsequentlyI was fired from my job...and forced to move out of my apartmentand move into a motel.[Blowing Nose] And that's when you tried to Well, no.Actually, all of that was okay.What happened was two days ago theMacArthur Foundation, in its infinite wisdom...awarded a genius grantto Larry Sugarman.And that's when lDecided to check out early.Yes.

Not about luck, Frank.Luck is the name losers giveto their own failings.It's about wanting to win,willing yourself to win. You've got to want it badder than anybody else. I do.

Just knock.Look, just put himin the wardrobe, all right?What's it gonna hurt?Then if you need him,you got him.But then I gotta havea conversationwith thatwardrobe assistant, and, man, she's a fucking bitch.

You don't believethat old shit, do you?Yes, Rick, I do.And I work with my wife,and she believes it.She doesn't wanthis creepy ass around.You know, this is probablythe shittiest weather ever.The shittiest weatheron the shittiest boatwith the shittiest person.Natalie, my sister, said,""He's a loser. He's a loser.""They all said it,""He's a fucking loser,""and I didn't believe them.So I guessI'm the fucking idiot.And now you're notgonna talk to me?What, you don't feellike fighting?Well, I feel likefucking fightingbecause I've been up hereby myselffor four hours on thisfucking shithole of a boat.Yeah.Hhe's a goddamnwar hero. Fuck.Yeah, appreciate it.Okay, you fucking horse's ass.Let's get you over to wardrobe.Now, I'll put youin wardrobe,but you don't stunt,I don't pay you.Appreciate the opportunity,Randy. I won't let you down.You know my wife Janet,don't you?Yeah.Steer clear of her.Now, I admireCassius Clay, I do.What I admire is,in his sport,there's an elementof true combat.When Cassius Clay meetsSonny Liston in the ring,that's not two athletesposturing.That's combat.Two men trying to killeach other right now.If you don't beat him...he kills you.That's beyond athletics.That's beyondWide World of Sports, you know?That's two warriorsengaged in combat.That's what I admire.In martial arts tournaments,they won't let you fightlike that.It's very frustrating.You stand in front of a guy,and you just wanna let himhave it. Ha!But you can't.So you gotta do thisplayacting, pattycake version.Cassius Clay. Sonny Liston.Joe Louis.The colored boxer,not that whitekickboxing asshole.They do whatthey need to do to win.They unleashas much punishmentas they have toto defeat the other guy.But in martial artstournaments,I do to win whatthey do to win.I unleash all my power.I kill people.If you fought CassiusClay, who would win?Well,that would never happen.But if you did,what do you think would happen?I'd make him a cripple.Hey, you. What's your name? Me? Yeah, you.My name's Cliff.I'm Rick Dalton'sstunt double. Stuntman? Yeah.You know,you're kind of pretty for a stuntman.That's what they tell me.So did I say somethingfunny, stuntman? Yeah, you kind of did. What's so funny?Look, man,I don't want any trouble.I'm just hereto do a job.But you're laughing atwhat I'm saying.But I'm not sayinganything funny.So, what do you thinkis so funny?What I think is...you're a little manwith a big mouth and a big chip,and I think youshould be embarrassedto suggest you'd beanything more than a stainon the seatof Cassius Clay's trunks.Brother, you're the onewith the big mouth.And I would reallyenjoy closing it,especially in frontof all my friends.But my hands are registeredas lethal weapons.That means,we get into a fight,I accidentally kill you,I go to jail.Anybody accidentallykills anybodyin a fight,they go to jail.It's calledmanslaughter.And I think all that""lethal weapon"" horseshitis just an excuseso you dancersnever have to getin a real fight.Okay.How abouta friendly contest?No punching in the face.Two out of three.Who puts whoon the ground first?Nobody tries to hurt nobody,just who ends up on their butt?That's a great idea, Kato.You know, Bruce,that guy's kind of famous.That guy?For what?Killed his wifeand got away with it.That guy?That guy.Not bad, Kato.Try that again.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.What the fuckis going on here?Hey, jackass,this is our series lead.What the fuckare you thinking?You're right, Janet.I'm sorry about that.Don't fucking ""Janet"" me,you prick.Hey.What's up, babe?What's up, Randy,is that your loser asshole,wifekilling buddy boy here wasbeating the shit out of Bruce.What? Hey, Randy. Cliff.What the fuck, man?Let me just say, nobody beatthe shit out of Bruce.It was a friendly contest.He barely touched me.I think that dent in the carsays something different.Oh, my God!What the fuckdid you do to my car?!What the fuckdid you do to her car?I threw thislittle prick into it,but I did not knowit was her car.Get the wardrobe off,get your shit, and get fucked! Janet! What?I will handle this.Then fucking handle it,Randy.Cliff...get the wardrobe off,get your shit,and get off the lot.Fair enough.Aw. What's the matter?Are you afraid I'll tellJim Morrison you were dancingto Paul Revereand the Raiders?Are they notcool enough for you?Who's thisshaggy asshole?Hello? Can I help you?Oh, yeah. Hey, man.I'm looking for Terry.I'm a friend of Terry'sand Dennis Wilson's.Well, Terry and Candydon't live here anymore.This is the Polanskiresidence now.Really? He moved?Dang.Uh, you know...?You know where?I'm not sure,but the owner of the property,Paul, might.He's in the guest house.Who is it, Jay?It's okay, honey.It's a friend of Terry's.Yeah, just takethe back path.Thank you kindly.Ma'am. All right, that's an hour! Hey, Rick.I know they justbroke for lunch,but you need to wait at leastan hour before you can eat. Give that glue a chance to dry. Oh, no worries, honey.I got my book. Say, say,where's the badguy saloon?You just go straightthrough the Western town,take a right and a left,and you see it right there.Thanks, honey.Can we move to number two?How is his bounce?Can I get a bounce there?Just grab the crescentwrench, come right back.Just make it a quick one. Tim! Looks great. Right there.Hello.Hello.Hello.Would...Would it bother youif I satnext to youand read my book too?I don't know.Would you bother me?I'll try not to.Sit.Ah.Sorry. Sorry about that.Ahem.You don't eat lunch?I've got a sceneafter lunch.Yeah?Eating lunch before I doa scene makes me sluggish.I believe it's the jobof an actor...And I say ""actor,""not ""actress,""because the word ""actress""is nonsensical.It's the actor's jobto avoidimpedimentsto their performance.It's the actor's job to strivefor  percent effectiveness.Naturally, we never succeed,but it's the pursuit...that's meaningful. Who are you? You can call me Marabella.Mar... Marabella what?Marabella Lancer.No, no, come on, come on.What's your real name?When we're on set,I'd prefer to onlybe referred toby my character's name.It helps me investin the reality of the story.I've tried it both ways,and I'm always justa tiny bit betterwhen I don't break character.And if I can bea tiny bit better, I want to be.You're the bad guy.Caleb DeCoteau.I thought it waspronounced Caleb ""Dakota.""I'm pretty sureit's ""DeCoteau."" DeCoteau. Mm.DeCoteau. DeCoteau.Hmm.What are you reading?It's a biographyon Walt Disney.It's fascinating.He's a genius, you know.I mean, a onceineveryoryears kind of genius.What are you, ?I'm .What are you reading?Just a Western.What does that mean?Is it good? Pretty good. What's the story?I haven't finishedit yet.I didn't askfor the whole story.What's the ideaof the story?Well... ahem,it's about this guywho's a bronco buster.It's the storyof his life.Guy's nameis Tom Breezy,but everyone alwayscalls him Easy Breezy.Now, when Easy Breezywas in his sandandand young andgoodlooking, he could...He could break any horsethat you could throw at him.Back then,he just had a way.Now he's intohis, uh, late sand he takes a bad fall,and it messes up his hip.He's not... He's not...He's not crippledor anything like that, but...But he's gotspine problemshe never had before,and he spends, uh...more of his days in painthan he ever did before.Jeepers, this soundslike a good novel.Yeah, it's not bad.Where are you in it?Mm. About midway.What's happeningto Easy Breezy now?Uh, he's, um...He...He's not the bestanymore.In fact,far from it. And...he's coming to terms with whatit's like to be slightly more...use...Slightly more uselesseach day.Iit's okay, Caleb.It's okay.It sounds likea really sad book.Poor Easy Breezy.I'm practically crying,and I haven't even read it.About  years,you'll be living it.What?Nothing, pumpkin puss.I'm just...I'm just teasing you.You know something? You...You might be rightabout this book.I think it hits harderthan I gave it credit for.I don't like nameslike ""pumpkin puss,""but since you're upset,we'll talk about thatsome other time.I'm only going as faras Westwood Village.Hey, beggarscan't be choosers. Come on in. Thanks. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Good luck on your adventure. Thank you. Have a good time in Big Sur. Thank you so much. Take care. You too. Oh, hey.

Mmm.After that Musso& Frank's lunch meeting,Marvin did provide Rickjob opportunitiesin the Italian film industry.Rick Dalton,Marvin Schwarz here. Hold on.Hennessy X.O on the rocks.Yes, Mr. Schwarz.Two words.Nebraska Jim, Sergio Corbucci.NNebraska what?Sergio who?Sergio Corbucci.Aand who's that?The secondbest directorof Spaghetti Westernsin the whole wide world.He's doing a new Western.It's called Nebraska Jim.And because of me,he's considering you.Well, Rick got Nebraska Jim.And Rick made a rathercompelling Nebraska Jim,existing quite nicelywithin Sergio Corbucci'srogues gallery of antiheroes.In Rome,Rick loved the paparazziand the fussthey made over himand his Nebraska Jimcostar Daphna BenCobo.All right there, paparazzos.All right. Take it easy.He loved the foodso much that during his stay,Rick gainedalmost  pounds.But he didn't love theItalians' way of making movies.In fact,he thought the postsynced,every actorspeaks their own language,Tower of Babel shooting styleof European movieswas ridiculous.While in Rome,Marvin plugged Rickinto three otherItalian productions.His second Western wasKill Me Quick, Ringo,Said the Gringo,also starring Joseph Cottenand directedby Calvin Jackson Padget,pseudonym for Giorgio Ferroni.His third wasan Italian/Spanish coproductionthat paired himwith Telly Savalas,titled Red Blood, Red Skin,directed byJoaqun Romero Marchentand basedon the Floyd Raye Wilson n,The Only Good IndianIs a Dead Indian.And his fourth,a Spaghetti secret agent,James Bond ripofftype flickcalled Operazione DynOMite!,directed by Antonio Margheriti.Ultimatelymaking Rick's sixmonthItalian sojournfairly profitable,although his swankRoman apartmentate up a big chunkof his earnings.So as Rick returns to Hollywoodvia Pan Am,he has four new moviesunder his belt,some money in his pocket,and his brandspankingnewItalian wife,starlet Francesca Cappucci.Hurtling through the airtowards a new lifeand uncertain future,Rick was really not sureabout what lay ahead for him.Way back in coach,working on hisbottomless Bloody Mary,Cliff Booth returnedto Los Angeles as well.He kept Rick companyduring his entiresixmonth stay in Italy.However,as the two men return home,they've cometo an understanding.Well, here it goes now.With the, uh...With the new wife, I, uh...I just I can't afford youanymore, Cliff.You know? I can barely affordmy own house anymore.So I think the planis to sell the houseand buybuy a condo inininToluca Lake, bank the money.You know, live off it.That type of thing.Hopefully,I score come next pilot season.That's a good plan.Yeah. You know,by then, I'll knowif I have a career or not,if I'm a solid Los Angelescitizen like Eddie O'Brien says,or if I'm one step closerto going back to Missouri.So when this wholeEuropean journey is over,I think we've, uh...We've reachedthe end of the trail, Cliff.So these lastfour Italian flicks,after nine years together,would be Rick and Cliff'sfinal rodeo.Cliff doesn't have a cluewhat he's gonna do.The only thing the two menknow of for sure:Tonight,Rick and Cliff will havea good oldfashioned drunk.Both men know, once the planetouches down in El Segundo,it'll be the end of an erafor both of them.And when you come to the endof the line with a buddywho is more than a brotherand a little less than a wife,getting blind drunk togetheris really the only wayto say farewell.Here it is, honey. You like it? I love it.Where do you want it?Hello?Hey, it's Joanna and the baby.Hi! Come on up.Hi!Oh, honey. How are you? Oh, my gosh, you're about to pop! I know! I know. Oh! And this is the nursery. Oh, my God, Sharon. It's perfect. Do you love it?Little shoes!I know.I'm about to burst. I think you're gonna be a wonderful mother. Thank you.Mm! Thanks, Gillian. Bye!Bye, Brandy!Sharon had two friendsmove intothe Cielo Drive residencewhile Roman was in Londonpreparing his next movie:Voytek Frykowski, an old friendof Roman's from Poland,and his girlfriend,social worker Abigail Folger,heiress to the vastFolger coffee empire.That night,Sharon, her two houseguestsand, naturally, Jay...all went to the West HollywoodMexican restaurant landmarkEl Coyote,on Beverly, for dinner.What's going onat the dirty movie place?Oh, they're havinga premiere.Dirty movies have premieres?Yeah. They're fun. This place is always so busy. I know.It's crazy in here.And right here for you. Gentlemen. Oh. Thanks.While closer to:, Rick and Cliff wentto the ValleyMexican restaurant landmarkCasa Vega on Ventura.Hello. Welcome.You're welcome, sir.Well, well, well,if it ain't the cobra himself. Hey, Doug. What's happening? How you doing? It's good to see you. How's the wife?I'm just kidding.I'm just kidding.Brandy stayedbehind at Rick's house,guarding the beautifulItalian woman asleep in her bedand waiting for Cliffand Rick to come home...while jetlaggedFrancesca slept.But you just get paidfor the day that you cut his hair? No, no, no.I get paid $ a day.I get paid $the day I arrive. I get paid $... At El Coyote,margaritas and good timeswere had by all, except Sharon.Sharon was experiencinga touch ofpregnancyinduced melancholy.Not only that,it was later reportedthat it was the hottest nightof the year,and it made her feelespecially pregnantin all the worst ways.I don't want to party anymore.I am tired.Because he got it done.No, it's not... It's notbecause he just got it done.He had just as much timeas all the restof the goddamn directors.What he did with that time...That's what counted.At Casa Vega,Rick and Cliff drank so much that,when they left,they left the Cadillac thereand took a cab home.The greatest action director,underrated guy of all time.Around ,Sharon and her friendsleft El Coyoteand arrived back at her house.You've had,like,  margaritas.The four of themhung out a little longer,with Abigail even playingthe piano for them... Don't get me madDon't tell no lie  Don't make me sadDon't pass me by  Baby, are you holding  Holding anything but me?  'Cause I'm a realStraight shooter  If you know what I mean  You can bring me loveYou can hang around  You can bring me up  Don't you bring me down ...until shereturned to her room,smoked a jointand read a book.That was around .At more or less the same time,Voytek laid on the couchwatching American televisionand thought abouthow much better it wasthan Polish television,as he smoked a big joint.Somewhere around :,Sharon changedinto her comfy house attire.Feel better?That is drastically better.It was after : by the timethe yellow cabdropped Rick and Cliffin front of the house.Thank you. Right here.All right. Grazie, amigo. How much do I owe you? Three dollars.Brandy wasglad to see them return. Thank you, brother. Thanks.More margaritas.Around midnight,a completely drunkRick Dalton started makinga blender of frozen margaritas.All right. We're walking. At the same time,Cliff was attaching a leashto an excitedBrandy's dog collar.I know.I remember you.A cigarette dipped in acid. What's that do? You smoke it. It gets you high. How much? Fifty cents.Fifty cents.Hippie girl,  cents.Tonight the night?Why not?And away we go.Our Polish friend said it wasthe hottest day of the year.Despite thefact that he said it,actually, it might be true.Goddamn.Fucking private road.Damn property taxesup the butt.Goddamn.Bunch of goddamnfucking hippies.What the fuck?Hey, you!Yeah, asshole,I'm talking to you!What the helldo you think you're doingbringing that noisy hunk of shitaround here at midnight?This is a private road,all right?Who are you?And who are you here to see?Nobody, sir.

He doesn't likethe dark and cries on occasion......but other than that....He cries, does he?Got a lot to cry about, I'd say.You know what he did.I read the court transcript.Thank you, missus.My pleasure.Kids!Lunch is about ready.Y'all come on up.Coming, Mama!What exactly are youtrying to find out?I wonder if he did anythinglike that before.Why? Has he said anything?No, but a man who doesa thing like that......has often developed a taste for itover time. lt occurred to me......that it might be easy enough tofollow his back trail. Find out.A man his size, and colored to boot,can't be that hard to trace.You'd think so, but you'd be wrong.Believe me, we tried.Like he'd dropped out of the sky.How can that be?We're in a depression.A third of the country's out of work.People are drifting by the thousands,looking for jobs, for greener grass.Even a giant like Coffeywouldn't get noticed everywhere.Not until he killsa couple of little girls.He is......strange, I admit.But there doesn't seem to beany real violence in him.I know violent men, Mr. Hammersmith.I deal with them day in and day out.You didn't come to ask mewhether he killed before.You came to see if i thinkhe did it at all.Do you?One seldom sees a less ambiguous case.He was found with the victimsin his arms.And yet you defended him.Everyone is entitled to a defense.Kids! Lunch!Y'all listen to your mama!I'll tell you something.You listen close too, because itmight be something you need to know.I'm listening.We had us a dog.Just a sweet mongrel.You know the kind.Well, in many ways,a good mongrel dog is like a Negro.You get to know it.Often, you get to love it.lt is of no particular use......but you keep it aroundbecause you think it loves you.lf you're lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, younever have to find out any different.My wife and i were not so lucky.Caleb, come here for a second.Come here.Please, son.He still has the one good eye.I suppose he's lucky......not to be completely blind.We get down on our knees and thank Godfor that much at least.Right, Caleb?Go on in, now.That dog attacked my boyfor no reason.Just got it in his mind one day.The same with John Coffey.He was sorry afterwards.Of that i have no doubt.But those little girls......stayed raped and murdered.Maybe he'd never done it before.My dog never bit before.But i didn't concern myself with that.I went out with my rifle, grabbedhis collar and blew his brains out.ls Coffey guilty?Yes, he is.Don't you doubt it.And don't you turn your back on him.You may get away with it onceor even a hundred times......but in the end......you'll get bit.Oh, me! Oh, my!I'm smelling me some corn bread.lt's from my missus.She wanted to thank you.Thank me for what?Well, you know.For helping me.Helping you with what?You know.Was your missus pleased?Several times.John, I can smell that from over here.I surely can.Can i give Del and Mr. Jingles some?Well, it's yours, John.You can do with it as you please.Here. This for Del and Mr. Jingles.Hey! What about me?I'm gonna get some too, ain't l?lt's yours, John. As you please.I think i'll just keep the rest, then.Courtesy of the gentlemanacross the way.John, that's so very fine of you.I thank you.

I think he slipped. He knocked him down. He didn't slip. He slipped. Oh, Jack... Come on.That's a fucking lie!They say he's in trouble with drugs...What are you doing?Are you talking shit about the family? No, not at all. Yeah. I heard you say.We're not like that.This is not what Lowell is all about.I thought he could make a comebackand make us proud, but he didn't. I don't know what Dicky was thinking.

Oh, my God, you know what that sounds like? He's a crook, George! He owns a taxicab company! He's organized! Oh, my God, he's a cab driver. He knows everything about boxing, right?

""""No E"""" Micky Ward. Hey", somebody push that. Where are we going? To the ring. The ring's across the street. The ring's across the street? Yeah.Smaller venue. They've gotno dressing rooms over there.It's a starter, Micky.Hey.Good luck.That's it. That's it.Yeah!Yeah!Visit for Dick Eklund.Dicky!Heard you won a bunch of fights, Mick.That's good.I know you know what I'm doing.I'm sure Alice and everybody else told you.I just wanted to tell you to your face myself.I've got a new manager andMickey O'Keefe's my trainer now.It's going good.Yeah. They've got you fighting Alfonso Sanchez. On HBO. Bet you're proud of that. Fucking right. HBO is the best at the Mexican fight. Wake up.I didn't think they weregoing to be invested in me. I've got a shot. I'm going to take it. Wake up.They don't care if it kills you.Mike Toma did it. He's using you.Like a stepping stone for Sanchez. Why don't you see? Oh, I see.How could I stand a chance withoutthe great Dick Eklund in my corner, right?You didn't give a fuck if I gotkilled by Mungin,now, all of the sudden, you're worriedSanchez is going to hurt me?Why?Come on, Dick. Because you're stuck in hereand can't be the center of attention no more? You need it that bad? It's a Mexican fight.He fights you,hits like a fucking mule, all right?Fifteen counts undefeated. You crazy?And that taxicab idiot, Lanano?He went right for it.He's a paper gangster.He's using you to steal money.Why can't you just shut upand be happy for me?I've spent the last ten years of my lifein bad fights set up by you and Alice.I've finally got a good thing going for me,and you can't be fucking happy for me? Why?What's your plan?How are you going to fight Sanchez?I ain't going to talk about that.What's your plan? I'm not here to talk about that. Bullshit. Yes you are.You watch the fight and you'll see the plan.I can't watch it. They don't let us.It's too fucking violent, you know?Two minutes, Dicky.They let us watch a stupid documentary about crack,but I can't watch my own brother fighting.Hey, Mick. What is it?You scared? You embarrassed because you don'teven have a plan? I'm your brother. Just tell me. You're going to shit on it no matter what I say. I'm not going to shit on it. Just tell me.Go toetotoe, overhand right in middle rounds.He's weak against overhand right. Who came up with that? Fatty fuck O'Keefe? Fuck you, Dicky.You've got to run against this guy.Let him burn himself out.Take it to the body, right?Get inside, switch stanceslike you're going to work his right.Hit him on the left.You ain't me.Okay, you can't be me.You had a hard enough time being youwhen you had your fucking chance,and that's why you're in here, all right?I'll fight Sanchez the way I fight.I'm talking about the way you fight,you moron! You know I'm right. He knows I'm right. All right.Blow to the right.Ward just in. wins,  losses so far.Twenty KOs. He's been a little bettersince he refocused himself on the sport,as J.B. pointed out.Now here's Ward's opponent, Alfonso Sanchez,out of Tijuana, Mexico.See the record,  wins,  KOs, firstround KOs.There's Mike Toma, the promoter of the fight,who has a lot invested in Sanchez.He says that Sanchez is one of the mosttalented young prospectsin the sport of boxing.This is really one of the saddestkinds of fights in boxing.Micky Ward is  years old.He's here because he needs the money. He's taking a beating. My point is thathe doesn't really have to sit hereand take this beating. He can do something about it. Which is what? Have his corner throw in the towel? Or fight back.You can see his power.Every time he hits Ward, he backs him up. Unless the referee thinks he can't... The referee should just stop this fight.We know that Micky doesn't want to be here. I wouldn't make the crowd... No, he's fighting scared, Dick.Running away, not hitting back.Oh, Jesus. He's going to get hurt.Doing the same old shit.Never seen such an embarrassing performance.He's doing what I told him, Mom.He's doing what I told him.Don't worry about it.He's doing what I told him.Micky Ward showing nothing but respect.What are you running around for?Stop running around.Shut the fuck up, Sal.Shut the fuck up!I don't know what you're doing, Micky.You want to fucking tell me?Because I don't know what you're doing.We'd have lost all five rounds.Is that what you want?This is dreadful, dreadful stuff.You've got to show me something soon,Mick, or I'm going to stop the fight.They're going to stop the fight, Micky.He's got to go inside, Mom.He's got to take it to the body.He's got it. Don't stop the fight. They're going to stop this fight.You've got to do something, baby.You've got to do something.Try what we talked about, Micky.We had a plan, and you're not doing it. Let's go. All right, Micky.You've lost the first five rounds,what's the next strategy going to be?Double right hand by Sanchez,then a triple left hook.Couple of the left hooks landed flushon the cheek of Micky Ward.Ward tying Sanchez up.Very curious performance by Micky Ward.Ward seems to be trying to land one big shotto either change Sanchez's mind...And he's beginning to open up, takingadvantage of opportunities to get close to Wardand throw against a fighter who isnot defending himself by punching.Sanchez is going to try to end this fight.What are you doing? Come on.Come on!He's down on an uppercut.Nicely thrown left uppercut inside.Very good. And right after Wardthrew a pretty good right hand.Mick, you all right?This is a fight that should be stopped. Come on, head, body, head. Ugh. This is not professional. That's exactly what I'm saying.I sure wish they paid me to watch this.Come on, Mick!Head, body, head.That was a good body shot by Ward. Maybe he'll turn it around. I'm talking about his body shot.Sanchez dropped by that shot!Oh, my God!What a punch!The most unlikely knockoutyou have ever seen!That is a kidney shot,The kind of kidney shot that's not as severe...Yeah!I still don't believe what I just saw!Micky! Micky! Micky!Micky won!Now did Micky Ward just make idiots of us allwith a spectacular piece of strategy? Take another look. Amazing.A big win in the career of Micky Wardof Lowell, Mass.Unbelievable defeat at the hands of Micky Ward,who had all but given away the firsthalf dozen rounds in the bout.I think what Micky did was he recognizedthat he'd hurt the guy with the body shot.Micky's a better fighter than thatto not be running from that guy like that.Theater of the unexpected.Hey, you never knowwhat can happen, right?Never give up in this game, right?Never give up.You can't make it up, folks.You know what Micky just said?He said you can't give up in this game.Well maybe Micky Ward heard me sayhe should stop this fight, and he went out and stopped it. Yeah.I can't believe it.I'm looking over and I'm thinkingto myself like they were thinking:This thing is over.But I tell you what.Even look at the commentators.They started to take their headsets offbefore he was even counted out. They just wanted to get out of there. Mick. Mick...I just spoke to Mike Toma again andhe just told me something very interesting.He just told me, had Sanchez won tonight,he would have gotten the title shot. Holy Christ, that's beautiful. Why? Why is that beautiful? A title shot. Micky gets the shot. Are you sure about that? You've got to be very clear about this, because this is my kid's future. I just spoke to the guy. Mike, come here. Look, tell these guys. Hey. Congratulations. Thank you. Not a stepping stone anymore.I always knew you had the talent.That was a hell of a strategy,wearing him down like thatand taking it to the body.Thirty years in the business,I've never seen a knockout like that.Larry Merchant was writing your obituaryand Sanchez drops like he was shot with a gun.Where did you get that?That's the first thing my brother taught me.Tap them to the head, dig into the body. That's a hell of a body shot. Thank you.You ready for a title shot? Yes! Yes! That's what I was talking about. He's ready. You're ready, aren't you?Shea Neary in London for the title!Are you kidding me?We've got some celebrating to do. Yeah, I think so. Thank you so much.You're going to havea great champion, my boy.It's what your brotherwould have always wanted.He's not even going to be there. Hey! Daddy! Hey there, buddy.

You know...Alice says prison might have beenthe best thing for me.It got me clean. Got me clear up here.It's a beautiful thing, Dick.I've got to talk to you about something.Yeah.The old locker, huh?I made a promise to themI wouldn't work with you again.Huh?I had to, after everything that happened.I'm sorry.You sticking to that?I'm glad you're back.You look good.I don't know what else to say. Mick, you fucking kidding me? No, I'm not. Hey, Micky. Micky, come on in.You're too loud.You've got to do this at home, please. What are you talking about? Mom, please.All right, girls. Let's pack it up. Why? Let's get it put away.If that's what Micky wants,we're going to put it away. There's your brother. Dicky!Hey there. Hey there.It's nice. It's nice. Been working on it for two weeks. Hey, Sherri, come on. Stop.All right, girls, come on. Let's go home.It's not the time to do this, obviously. What's going on? We ain't going to work together.They don't want me to work with him.What are you talking about?That's not right.Micky never would havewon Sanchez without Dicky. That's fucking bullshit! Take it back! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't you fucking talk to my mother like that. Fuck you!Why don't you ask Micky?We're going to train. They've got to go.They've got to go, Mick.Come on. You all right? Ask him, George.Ask him if he would have won Sanchezwithout his brother.No, I wouldn't have won Sanchezif it wasn't for Dicky. How can you say that to O'Keefe? Because it's true.I went in with our game plan and it wasn't workingso I went back to what I learned with Dicky.And I wouldn't have won without you,either, O'Keefe, okay?I mean, you know that.We worked hard. You got me ready.You got your confidenceand your focus from O'Keefe,and from Sal,and from your father, and from me. Dicky is a junk bag. Hey!He's a junk bag! Fuck you, Charlene. Oh, fuck you!I'm sober.Oh," yeah. And I'm sure you're going to needsomething for something now that you're out. """"Oh", my back! Oh," my back!"""" Fuck you! What are you always picking on me for", huh? No, fuck you!And what about O'Keefe?We're in the same boat.One day at a fucking time, right, O'Keefe?You and me.It's all right for him to be here?Why am I the fucking problem? I'm his blood! I'm his family! You're the problem!I'm the one fighting, okay?Not you, not you, and not you. I know what I need. And you need Dicky?I want Dicky back.And I want you, Charlene,and I want O'Keefe.I want my family.What's wrong with that? Not the deal we made, baby. She's right, Micky. That's not the deal. It wasn't the deal.Come on, you can't do this to us.You sound like them now. I sound like them now? Yeah, you sound like them. We sound like them? You can't do this to us. You can't do this to us.You sound like them.You should fucking listen to yourself.You sound like them, just like them.Maybe this is where you belong. That's the way you love him? Charlene! Come on! You want your brother? Good luck. O'Keefe, come on...

One of the bestto do anything to hurt him.You're my hero.I was.I was... I'm sorry. Yeah?There's a press conference downstairs. Come on. Let's go. Guys...Neary: Ten stone, six pounds.Ward: Ten stone, six pounds.Hey, Micky. Micky Ward!We have a question over here.How have you been training? I train. I train hard. Shea's  in . Never been knocked down.Well that's going to change tomorrow.In fact we expected a much better fighter.I'm just grateful to be here and havethe opportunity. Thank you, guys, for the shot.Shea, who do you respect as a fighter?And who would you like to fight next?I plan on movingright through Micky Ward tomorrow,moving on to other big fighters,like Gatti.I believe Gatti and I wouldmake a great match.And now, ladies and gentlemen,twelve rounds of boxingfor the WBU WelterweightChampionship of the World!Don't listen to them, Mick.And there is Micky Wardof Lowell, Massachusetts entering the ring.It's his first fight outside the United States.Micky Ward,  wins,  losses....He's back and better, recently.Twenty KOs.And now Ward awaits his opponent,Shea Neary.Neary regards himself asthe European Arturo Gatti,"meaning that he is a headonhighcontact fighterwho throws seventy punches per round.Neary is from Liverpool and shouldhave a huge following her tonight.Accompanied by """"Paint the Town Red""""by the Mahones.Neary is the currentWelterweight Champion of the World.He is a very tough young man.Beyond dedicated. Lives a spartan existence.And according to his promoters",there's nothing but eat, drink, think,fantasize and dream of fighting.Shea Neary has had  professional fightsand won them all.Seventeen KOs.Start when you hear the bell.Shake hands.Both of you. Shake hands.As close as we just saw them in the middleof the ring, forehead to forehead.That's how close we expect them to befor as long as this fight goes on.Ward is a long ways from home.Don't coast in a foreign country.Well the big challenge for Ward is to get offto a faster start than is customary for him.Micky Ward a notoriously slow starterin big fights.Shea Neary an ultrafast starter.And that's the question that hoversover round one. Get ready for the fight.Already Shea Neary startstaking it to him on the ropes.And Neary going to the body,which is Ward's specialty. Whoa! Neary bangs Ward to the body. And a big uppercut by Neary. Neary leads off with a good left jab.Keeps opponents off balance,jabbing here and there.That was a good left hook by Nearyas he stepped in on Ward.Ward not able to deal with him very wellwhen Neary stands at range like this. Come on! That's it! Get him!My, is it tough for Micky Ward.Neary digging his own right hand to the body.They trade shots at close range.Ward is trying to match Neary blowforblow,and now Neary starts to come onand take the last thirty seconds to the round. How about that! Break!Tremendous barrage in the first minute.Just look at this. Unbelievable.What a great round one!Ward is going to have topick up the tempoand beat him with volumes of punching.No doubt Neary is a better boxer.Four hard right handsNeary has belted in the last minute.Quicker than Ward, more assertive than Ward.Surer of what he wants to do.They're standing and trading shotsat the center of the ring.Ward's going to have to step it upa little bit more than he is right now.Micky Ward's corner takinga really deep look at what's going on now,and his family at ringsidewell aware he's stepping up in class.Ward has to got to be more aggressive.He can't just try to wait untileverything is perfect.Despondence over Micky Wardis increasing as the fight goes onbecause his plan was the right oneand he's executing it.Punches like these make it seemthat it's now Neary's fight.Ward hasn't been in this kind of warwith as strong a fighter as Neary.They are trying to hurt each otherwith only punches.They've tested each other's will,now they're testing each other's skill.And Ward fumbled thereby a right cross from Neary. Ward hurting now, his legs are gone. Neary goes to the body as he tries to finish Micky. Vicious body shots from Neary. And Ward doesn't even try to move off the ropes.I don't know if he can, Jeff.He's waiting for Neary to punch himself out.Down goes Micky Ward, and he may be out.Come on, that's it!That's my boy!Forward! Forward!Come on! Ward is out on his feet! Loser! Go back to America!This could be it for Micky Ward.Dicky, get him a fucking stoolWhere's the stool?Charlene, will you get the fuckout of here with your high heels?His brother's got Ward jumpingto wake up his legs.I think this could be Ward's last chanceto turn this fight around.It's Micky Ward against the aggressivenessand clean punching of Shea Neary.If you don't have your defense upyou can really get hurt.He's making it very difficult for Micky Ward.I don't think he's going to give it to him,at this rate.This is a survival move.Are you like me? Huh?Just good enough to fight Sugar Ray?I never had to win, did I?You've got to do more than that.You've got to win a title.For you, for me, for Lowell.This is your time, all right?You take it.I had my time, and I blew it.You don't have to, all right?Now fucking get out there.Bring that fucking anger.All the shit you've been throughover the fucking years,put it in the ring right now.This is yours. This is fucking yours. Okay. Fucking head, body, head, body. Say it back to me. Head, body, head, body.You can do it.Stay off the fucking ropes.If I'm in Micky Ward's corner tonight,I'm thinking if he doesn't pick things upthis round and get going,he'll just get totally wiped out.Get off the ropes!Get off the ropes, Mick!Once again, Ward against the ropesas Neary is free to attack.What are you doing?Come on, Mick...Sometimes if you want to win,you've got to be something that you're not.Off the fucking rope, man!That ain't it!Neary continues to pound away.Don't take no abuse!This is your time," Micky!It's all for you!
