tt7131622,1,I can't spoil this movie because there's nothing to spoil!!! No plot. Nothing happens. If I submitted this same screenplay to Hollywood it would get rejected.
tt0449059,1,"""I have to admit, I was drawn to this movie because of the great cast and a lot of positive word of mouth. I watched the movie in a very good mood and when it was over, I said, what is the big deal? I did not laugh, I did not cry, I did not feel anything, except that I had seen this movie a dozen or more times already. It really was nothing special. Arkin's comedic performance was a rehashed role that I have seen others play. I remember a film called """"Flirting With Disaster"""" which was kind of a road movie as well, it was better than this. """"Raising Arizona"""" was much funnier than this. The so-called side-splitting ending with the dance to Super Freak was so tipped in commercials that you knew what was coming. Moreover, the dance just keeps going and going, it got so tedious and unfunny. I'm sorry, I don't want to be a cynic, but this film is just being played up way too much and I cannot believe that it was nominated for Best Picture, it was a weak year, but not that weak."""
tt0388795,1,"""I'm in a tiny minority, but I was so disappointed with Brokeback Mountain. I suspect in a few years time people will wonder why it won so many awards - maybe it was just a movie of its time. There is no empathy with the central characters, the falling in love is sudden and brutal, and the pacing throughout was incredibly ponderous. And, for a poor Englishman, trying to understand the muttering dialogue was a real challenge. It was completely cold throughout - none of the characters mattered, nor did their fate stir the slightest emotion. One scene slipped into the next, endlessly, as the movie meandered its way towards a finish. And, boy, did it meander! It seemed to take forever. This movie felt every second of its 2 hours and 15 minutes. Avoid."""
tt0190332,1,"""With the amount over-zealous hype surrounding this film, one would expect something of grand design. Sadly, that's all it is, over-zealous hype. Possibly the most over-hyped film since Star Wars: Phantom Menace. As I sat in the theatre watching this I couldn't help but laugh heartily at the defying gravity antics that only made me want to start singing, """"Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can."""" Yes, it is that bad. Two women sitting in front of me kept shooting dirty looks my way, but really how could anyone take this absurd movie seriously? In fact, Jade Fox (the film's remorseless """"bad guy"""")merely alters the hairdo and for some strange reason no one recognizes him. I suppose everyone is blind, and dumb. And that's what this movie is, dumb.First, the acting is on par with every other absurd """"action,"""" gravity defying kung-fu film. Nothing special, period. The script is littered with the most inane dialogue, again like most films of this type. Really, had it been dubbed the pathetic reality of that would be more noticed. The story is, again, on par with every other film in this genre... tinged with a little spaghetti western thrown in for good measure. So, in reality there is nothing special about this film. Nothing!Ok, so perhaps some people will find the gravity-defying antics some sort of brainless entertainment for two hours. I didn't. The action scenes are well choreographed, but when they begin to toss their hands in the air and take off like Superman, crawl around on bamboo tree tops like somekind of monkey, crawl up walls and skip across roofs you just can NOT take it seriously. It's just comical to the extreme. And really, it is so very obvious that these people are on wires, you can practically see them (and in a few scenes, if you pay close attention, you can).This film is too absurd to be any good, too serious to be campy or fun and just doesn't work at all. With the boxoffice booming on this, I can only imagine a select few people are seeing it over and over and over, and in the process tricking their friends into seeing it too. I rarely feel as though I wasted my money when I go see a film, but I DID in fact waste my money when I saw this turkey."""
tt7131622,2,"""I LOVE QT films and couldn't see this movie fast enough. All I can say is what was that all about? It was so boring. Did anyone edit this film? Leonardo's character was not likable. The only person tolerable was Brad Pitt. Nothing happened what so ever. The dialogue was not clever. The movie never went anywhere at all. It was just endless scenes of other movies being made. People driving in cars. Bare feet over kill. By the time the ending happened I didn't care anymore. I wanted to LOVE this movie, but I haven't been this bored in a long long time. I wish i felt differently."""
tt0120689,3,"""Frank Darabont's follow up to the Shawshank Redemption is a poorly written and painfully unoriginal story. For starters, the Noble Savage stereotype is racist at best. A character that is misunderstood by society and doesn't want to live in that society due to the character's extreme moral idealism (i.e. edward scissorhands, powder, etc.) is far from new. Coffey's character is not the only one that is one dimensional. Pretty much all the characters' dispositions are made to be one of two things: good or bad. There are no gray lines and it is obvious who the audience is supposed to hate and who they are supposed to root for. It's boring and childish. The frenchman, Michael Jeter, is made up so that we feel completely sorry for him. We're not even allowed to know what his crime was because then we might not love him so much.The prison guards are the most loving forgiving group of prison guards that have ever lived. Hell, they're the most loving forgiving people that ever lived. A prisoner spits in Tom Hanks's face and he actually does nothing about it? My grandmother isn't that nice.Stop reading here if you have not seen the movie.And wasn't it convenient that that prisoner, Sam Rockwell, just happened to be the actual criminal behind Coffey's crime? And when they """"caught"""" Coffey with the girls, can anyone honestly say that if a black man was found with two dead white girls that they would not shoot him? Black men in the 30's, and especially in the South, would be killed for being seen in public with a white woman, much less killing a white child.And when Coffey does die, Tom Hanks doesn't put too much effort into stopping the execution. He just asks Coffey what he should do, and Coffey says nothing, so that's what he does. Of course Coffey must die, because in all racist Noble Savage films the savage must die so that his white savior can learn a valuable lesson.And where is the warden at this point? He said he can't stop the execution, but I find that implausible. I'm sure he could at least try to save the man who saved his wife. And wasn't that a plot twist that was hard to see coming? I also found it interesting that when Coffey healed her, he also did her hair and put makeup on her. The whole movie has no real continuity being that it was adopted from a serial novel. The movie could have ended in about five different places and the audience wouldn't have minded. The only interesting element of this movie is its ending which certainly does not save it. I suppose this movie is more Stephen King's fault than Darabont's, but regardless the movie is a disappointment in front the backdrop of all the superb movies that have been released with it in the past few months."""
tt0119488,3,"""L.A. Confidential is one long dull confusing movie with small sparks that quickly fade and burn out, even a stellar cast including Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe cant get past the convoluted script that makes so many twists and turns you will get a headache, the acting is good except for one person and that one person is Kim Basinger who for some unknown reason was given an oscar, I say given because her performance in this movie was not only terrible but it was one of the worst I have ever seen. If you like good movies try something else, if you like watching a movie for three hours that bores you to tears and makes you say thanks god that is over try this. 3 out of 10 stars"""
tt0111161,3,"""WEll I had high hopes for this movie.  But it fell way short.  I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen.  Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.Jason"""
tt0964517,4,"""As any movie of this type has to do, it finally draws you into the protagonist's situation and gets you rooting for him. In this case the protagonist is real-life boxer Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who has to overcome big odds - not the least of which is an extremely dysfunctional family headed up by his controlling mother Alice (Melissa Leo) and his drug addict brother Dicky (Christian Bale) who used to be a boxer and who's claim to fame was knocking down Sugar Ray Leonard (or did Sugar Ray slip?) and who now wants to live his dream through his brother. I appreciated the fact that Sugar Ray appeared as himself in a couple of brief scenes. By the time Mickey gets his title shot you are rooting for him, and you do admire his strength in overcoming the challenges he's faced. The actual title shot, mind you, struck me as a bit anti- climactic to be honest. It was pretty quickly portrayed and frankly the whole thing ultimately left me a bit empty, although I was satisfied to see Mickey become the champ.For three-quarters of the movie, though, the focus is really on the dysfunctional family relationship, and the challenge presented to that relationship by the sudden appearance of Charlene (Amy Adams) - a local bartender and college dropout who hooks up with Mickey and pushes him to escape his family's controlling influence. This was a good performance from Adams. I found her the most interesting of the cast, because she was playing a character very different from the usual cute and sweet roles I've seen her in, and so she demonstrated a versatility I hadn't seen from her before. Wahlberg and Bale were all right, but I didn't find anything especially noteworthy about their performances.In the end, the biggest weakness of this movie was that it really failed to draw me in until the title fight (and to an extent the fight that led up to the title fight.) I was bored frankly by the family, who struck me as a sort of Massachussetts version of """"white trash"""" and who weren't really all that interesting. I can't imagine growing up with those sisters. Mickey deserves credit just for not punching any of them out. This really didn't do a great deal for me. It offers about half an hour that really intensely interested me, which fizzled out in a truly too abrupt ending and focused mostly on an unappealing family."""
tt9770150,4,"""I am one of those people who live on the road by choice, and have done so for 10 years.I felt as though this movie did not paint a true picture of folk who are houseless, but NOT by choice. Their day to day struggle was only touched on. Safety, security, health, food, fuel costs are all issues faced by these good folk every single hour of every single day.The raw close ups did make you feel every emotion and the scenery was beautiful, but the movie didn't hit the mark for me. The camaraderie with fellow travellers was spot on. We all help each other out, no matter the circumstances.I would be very interested to hear what other permanent travellers think of this movie."""
tt5052448,5,Went to watch this film after hearing good things about it and seeing the overwhelmingly good reviews on IMDb and rotten tomatoes. But unfortunately I am severally unimpressed. Whilst the film was ok it did not live up to the hype. The plot was predictable and transparent. And for labeling itself as a horror it wasn't scary at all. Though I understand that it's trying to make a point and I feel it does this very well since it's influenced so many people. But overall I would say this film is average and I would much rather reccomend my friends something else.
tt5052448,5,"""I was looking for a good horror movie and decided to pick this one after seeing very high ranking in the reviews.After watching the movie, I am pretty surprised. I don't understand the level of praise in the reviews. I don't think it deserve half of it.The message of the story is disturbingly obvious. All the way, I was expecting a deeper meaning or a twist. But disappointed to find none. It was pretty straight forward and predictable.It is not scary at all. I would not consider it as a horror category. Sometimes it was cringe too.In general it was a boring experience for me. Hardly 5 out of 10."""
tt0120689,5,"""This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of all time.  It didn't suck really bad, IMO, but was just plain average - and on the boring side of that.  I didn't find it very emotionally moving, and I thought it was quite """"cheesy"""".  I didn't get really involved and enveloped into the movie as one would when watching a truly great film, and I even say this in a nice big theatre too.  This movie just didn't turn my crank, it was very predictable, was not very thought provoking, and I'm very surprised there aren't more mixed reviews at least from the users of this site...The Green Mile is NOWHERE CLOSE to The Shawshank Redemption, and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same sentence as an emotionally powerful masterpiece such as that.  Granted that neither film is meant to appeal to your intellectual side, but more to your emotions - this film even fails at that, in my opinion.  Perhaps I just couldn't get into it because it was too cheesy...Overall, this was a disappointing film, and I know I'm not the only one who thinks that as well.  Based on people I've spoken with, this film should have more mixed reviews rather than the overwhelming praise it seems to have got."""
tt0111161,5,"""Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so.  It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination.  I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama.  Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this."""
tt0499549,6,"""I did see Avatar for the first time a while ago, and didn't know what to make of it. To me it felt like a visual feast if little else. Re-watching it again, I found more strengths, but there are several weaknesses that prevent it from being a masterpiece.Starting with Avatar's strengths, it is absolutely mind-blowing visually. The cinematography, landscapes, scenery, colours, make-up and effects are outstanding and are by far and away Avatar's strongest asset. I also liked the score, it is certainly not the best score I have ever heard, but it had some very nice moments, while Cameron's direction is competent, the message admirable, and the finale well and truly explosive. I also loved the flying sequences, they were breathtaking.The acting in general is a mixed bag. Sam Worthington is a charismatic enough lead, while Zoe Saldana is strong and spirited. Stephen Lang is an enjoyable and over-the-top villain of the piece too, however Sigourney Weaver is somewhat so-so, doesn't help really her character isn't that interesting while Michelle Rodriguez and Joel Moore aren't given very much to do.What didn't work so well is that Avatar's story, with themes of love in a time of chaos and man alone in a hostile environment, is rather simplistic and predictable. I also felt it took a while to get going, and that the relationship between Jake and Neytiri was on the dull side. And is it me, or does this film drag at times, particularly towards the end? Now don't get me wrong, I liked the concept, it wasn't exactly original, as I often heard it described as """"Dances with Wolves in Space with rip-offs of Pocahontas and FernGully""""- but I am not going to join those who say that- I have to admit regardless of its originality or lack of it the concept intrigued me. Then there is the dialogue, which is nothing special and never quite rings true. There are some amusing moments but a vast majority of the dialogue in the middle of the film never quite convinced or came across as cheesy. The characters also came across as rather clichéd, especially Giovanni Ribisi's, and the character development was lacking.So all in all, Avatar does have a lot of strengths, but a lot of weaknesses too. I will say I preferred it over The Hurt Locker, which to be honest left me cold, but I think I would be stretching it a bit if I said it was 5-star masterpiece. 6/10 Bethany Cox"""
tt0499549,6,"""""""Avatar"""" is not the next """"Star Wars"""" or """"Lord of the Rings."""" It might be the next """"Matrix,"""" though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next """"Matrix Revolutions."""" It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after """"Return of the King."""" There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the """"Na'vi,"""" aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen """"Dances with Wolves"""" and """"The Last Samurai."""" Heck, even """"Dead Man."""" The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, """"we have to fight terror with terror."""" The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about """"Star Wars"""" was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember """"Jake Sully."""" 6/10"""
tt0499549,6,"""Yeah this movie took several steps forward in terms of cinematography and filming technology, but that is all that can really be said to be what makes this film worth seeing. Everything else that makes a film great is totally lack luster.There is no deep character development. Why does Jake Sully really want to become a part of the Navi? What was life on Earth like? What really makes him want to break away from his roots there? Is it just the ability to walk? I mean are there no more Native Americans or Buddhists left on Earth (which is clearly who the Navi were based off of) to give him that spiritual satisfaction? How does he feel about filling his brother's shoes? Twin relationship? The conflict between scientists and the military is not developed. Every supporting character was a stock character. Michelle Rodriguez somehow manages to have a place in Hollywood after literally playing the same type of character in every film she is in (Fast and the Furious, SWAT, Blue Crush...yeah just put her in a futuristic helicopter and thats her in this one). Was Sigourney Weaver supposed to be a mother figure? How did the bad guy from the Last of the Mohicans feel about faking a Native American language? The plot was totally predictable, and the dialogue was crap. It was like James Cameron turned in his dialogue assignment a day late.This movie deserves no award nominations at all outside of those in technical categories."""
tt7131622,6,"""I'm a huge T fan, absolutely love many of his movies, but not all and sadly this joins the later list. The best way to describe this movie is """"A day in the life of a Hollywood Actor in 1969"""". That is, mostly just an AVERAGE day, which is largely where the problem lies for many of us who expected more here.Acting is great all around and saves it somewhat but like too often these days I really feel the script was weak. An example of this would be just how often we see Brad Pitt driving around by himself, where really nothing happens; it reeks of filler material but why even have it there in an already long film? Margo Robbie kind of got robbed here to some degree, her character just gets a very very minor role, didn't come off right at all.A day in the life of in 1969 is somewhat interesting to many but if that is going to be the core it really needed some more Ooommph; like the Bruce Lee scene, German meeting scene and sequences like the ending, which finally had his trademarks all over it. Even though the film does have a """"climax"""", there was really almost no lead up to it, and almost no really story tension throughout, sadly it mostly just plods along.Really hoping for a return to form for his 10th and apparently possible last film. This film has some charm, which mostly comes through in the great acting, but overall this was disappointing."""
tt7131622,6,"""Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood is maybe proof that Quentin Tarantino ranks alongside Stanley Kubrick. Both started to make overlong movies and were lionised by critics, many who were afraid to be critical of them.This might be Tarantino's most self indulgent film so far despite being a glorious period piece.Set in Los Angeles 1969. The film is an alternate history as it focuses on Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) who was once a star of the hit television show Bounty Law. Now Dalton's career is fading. He drinks too much, he does not remember his lines and his regular work is guest starring as the villain of the week.Accompanying Dalton is his stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) who acts as his driver and gofer. Booth is also short of work as he has a bad reputation in the stunt industry.Living next door to Dalton in LA is actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) who has just moved in with her director husband Roman Polanski. Life for her is attending parties and going to the cinema to see her latest movie.Dalton wonders if he should take up a suggestion to go and work in Italy and make spaghetti westerns which could kick start his career. Booth gave a pretty hippy a lift to a ranch which is full of strange people belonging to a cult. Booth seemed to have rubbed them up the wrong way.Eventually the various people cross paths in this reimagining of what might have happened on a fateful night in 1969.There is no doubt that that DiCaprio and Pitt give their all in this film as two middle aged men fading away at an uncertain time. Tarantino seems to have given this film a conservative hue, he really dislikes the counterculture. I wonder if he is angry with the #metoo movement which destroyed his friend Harvey Weinstein and raised questions over his own conduct in the past.Clocking in at under 3 hours this film meanders until it reaches its explosive climax. Until then you wonder what exactly is the story. The movie is a series of vignettes that hints at a director/screenwriter who is past his prime and seems to be obsessed with bare feet."""
tt7131622,6,"""Folks like me and you, come to see a Tarantino Film with great actors Leo and Brad. Half way through the show, despite having great art work and film that stays to the 70s, all of us are wondering...what on earth is this? Only people who actually heard of the infamous hollywood incident, would know what this show is about. Which is towards the last 40mins. The classic fable tale, summs everything up, folks are gonna lie to themselves, and claim this is unique and sophiscated blah blah blah. Unless you belong to that specific, smart group of people, you aint going to enjoy the 3hours long show. What we have here is the emperor's new clothes dilemma."""
tt7131622,6,"""Not even Tarantino with his blood-soaked trademark violence can save this year from mediocrity. It's abundantly clear that his ninth film is a passion project, his love letter to 60s Los Angeles when it was deemed cool for the hippie lifestyle to integrate with mainstream America. It's substantially glossy, kaleidoscopic, heck some may even describe this three hour long """"epic"""" as, well, epic. The only thing epic about this behemoth is Dalton's beastly flamethrower as he incinerates a group of Nazis. This is, without a doubt in my mind, Tarantino's weakest film to date and another sign of his progressive downfall in quality. An ageing television actor, his swooning stunt double and actress Sharon Tate navigate the alterations of the Hollywood film industry, with the Manson """"Family"""" providing a suitably bleak backdrop.Technically, this comedy-drama is good, and I'm not just saying that to ease the scathing hatred that is inevitably flying my way from Tarantino fans. His directorial efforts were effortless. Managing to sustain multiple storylines with a wide array of cameos from his ensemble cast and allowing the lead actors to chew the scenery til it's just mulch. A tribute to the art of filmmaking whilst also providing insight in an actor's mind during vast changes within the industry that made him famous. Tarantino's foot fetish aside, his ability to swoop the camera from high octane tracking shots following a horse to sub-urban houses in Hollywood hills (mostly comprising of single takes) is unprecedented. Even with a simple conversational piece, much like when Dalton meets Fraser for the first time and talks about the novel he's reading and resembling, it's executed with such confidence that it immediately entrances you. Overextended and laborious? Absolutely. Yet witnessing Dalton come to terms with his acting talent, alongside the beautiful creature that is Olyphant playing James Stacy, is oddly engrossing.Of course, only possible due to DiCaprio's electric performance. Purposefully overacting, consistently shouting and harnessing the only developed arc out of all the characters Tarantino shoves into the film. His comedic timing, reminiscent of his venture in Scorsese's 'The Wolf of Wall Street', is impressive and allows a handful of laughs to sneak in, particularly when on the set of 'Lancer'. These characters all residing in a well-designed, precisely replicated and exuberant city that encapsulated the culture at the time. The production was immaculate, accompanied by a signature soundtrack that oozes sophistication and provides a mixtape for golden rock'n'roll.So, like I mentioned, technically this is a very proficient film. Which begs the question """"why was I underwhelmed?"""". Well, that's because nothing happens. A near three-hour collage of Cliff Booth driving across Los Angeles, Sharon Tate watching her own film and the Manson """"Family"""" walking bare feet on lukewarm sand. It's so self-indulgent with no actual substance that it borders on being pretentious. The multiple storylines rarely mesh. Booth is the exact same character from start to finish and is only present to beat the smack down out of Bruce Lee. Tate has no purpose to the over arcing story whatsoever and diminishes the talent of Robbie who has considerably limited screen time. The entire Manson backdrop is utterly futile in terms of placement, that it seems incredibly forced during the last act (although ridiculously fantastic to watch) just so Tarantino can address the cult's motives. The length that various scenes last for was enough to send anyone to sleep, mostly due to the restrained writing from Tarantino that lacks the punch from his previous efforts. An unaccomplished conclusion that left me questioning the entire purpose of the film. Aside from Dalton being introduced to his neighbours, the start of the story is the exact same as the ending. No one has any development! When Tarantino alludes to something happening, like Booth investigating Spahn Ranch, he deviates and sets the pace back to pedestrian mode. Simply a mish-mash of cameos so that everyone working in Hollywood today can claim they were part of a Tarantino feature.For a film that is designed to be a homage to the golden age of Hollywood, there is a distinct lack of gold to be found in this bejewelled ensemble presentation. Whilst technically proficient and wonderfully acted, the absence of substance and genuine character development makes a three-hour affair feel more like a five hour ordeal. And it pains me to say that, as I wanted Tarantino to be the saving grace of this lacklustre year."""
tt7131622,6,"""Im sorry, i do rate tarantino but OUATIH is missing too much for it to be enjoyable. Tarantino has never worked with linear plot but it never seemed to matter because the artistry, dialogue and individuality carried the films (pulp fiction etc) but this is no longer the case. Yes the cinematography and the mood is great but the rest is just boring. The multitude of irrelevant western scenes last for hours on end (why so many for so long) and so many other scenes do not stand up on their own (why does damian lewis arrive? And the little girl?). Im not being cynical but the film lacks any power or meaning and little enjoyment."""
tt7131622,6,"""This is a tricky one. The acting is superb trhoughout. DiCaprio does himself proud, as does Pitt. It's shot well, it's incredibly nostalgic, but I can't help feel it's missing something. The last 30 mins are ace - that's where the positive reviews are kept. Tarintino does what he does best in that last half hour. It's a shame it took two hours to get there. More time developing the final storyline and less nostalgia would probably have led to a better experience. Or tell the same story in 90 minutes. The soundtrack was ace - pure sixties.All in all, go see it, but go for a wee first.Plot 3/10 Acting 9/10 Ending 7/10 Duration vs interest 3/10 Soundtrack 7/10Overall 6/10"""
tt5052448,6,"""Get Out Directed by Jordan Peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story, surrounding an African American man meeting his girlfriend's Caucasian family. The first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension. The start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown. I really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off. All the performances were great, particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion. Also the cinematography was very nice, containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts. As for negatives there are quite a few. The tone of this film is very messy. I wished the horror really got under my skin. Although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief. To me this broke all the tension, and really made me question the type of film I was watching. There are also quite a few plot holes, and scenes which really don't have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience. Once the film reaches the third act, I was really let down by the direction they took. I was expecting a smart and unique revelation. But all I got was a standard messed up horror movie """"twist"""". I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket. I really thought this movie would be insanely smart, but honestly it's really not that special. It didn't impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have. It's a solid and enjoyable film. But it's far from groundbreaking, so therefore I give Get Out a 6. I feel like many will disagree with my rating. If you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead. One thing I still don't see is why African Americans were targeted in the film. When it was asked the question was just brushed off..."""
tt5052448,6,"""I'm confused by this film, and after the hype I truly expected a lot more.Two lovers; a white woman and a black man go to visit the womans family, at their mansion where everything is a little unusual and slightly tense. The family have black servants, reminiscent of plantations of yesteryear, and they all act possessed.I didn't like any of the characters except Chris, who was brilliant, underplayed his role and was a genuinely likable character. Only he and his friend Rod, who was pretty damned funny, were the only good characters here.It had some quite creepy moments, but they were too few and far between, and some of the dialog was so cringe worthy I actually gave up on the film initially.What it could have had, if the plot been more plausible, is potentially a Jacobs Ladder/The Shining horror type quality. Mixing comedy with horror is no easy task.

Why had they not taken any interest in the girl's talent routine? Why had the boy not noticed his colour blindness earlier, had he never used crayons at school? Then you've got the uninteresting, unsympathetic characters like the grouchy old man, depressive gay man, sullen teen...all stereotypes who grate quickly.

I wasn't even watching a new work that Ang Lee put out just to say he did something. No, I was watching an engaging, emotional, heart-felt romantic drama.

Also, I liked other works by Ang Lee, specially EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN. I came to the obvious conclusion there must be something utterly boring about this film that makes me not give a rat´s ass about any character or any of their affected dialogues.

tt0190332,6,"""Being that I had seen many films from Hong Kong, my basic feeling is that this movie was overrated.  Yes, I expected some action with drama, which the movie did give, but the plot of the movie (spoiled rich princess wants to be #1) didn't captivate me.First the good.  Yes, the cinematography was beautiful, giving one glimpses of China never seen.  Second, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat were great.  I was especially surprised to see Chow do so well for an actor known as a gun toting hero.  The fight scenes were, for the most part, well choreographed, especially the scene with Michelle and Ying Zhang.So why overrated?  First of all, there were many kung-fu movies with similar or even better fight scenes.  Second, I just couldn't buy the """"flying leaps"""" seen here, especially for a film trying to be dramatic; how do they get the magic to do it?  Third, the character of the princess just annoyed me.  I think it would have been better to focus more on the characters of Michelle and Chow than on what seemed to be a spoiled brat.  Finally, I try to get the main gist of the film, but it just doesn't come to me.Quite frankly, if Ang Lee's name wasn't on this film, I doubt it would have gotten the recognition it got.  Yes, I know that's how the world turns, but a director's name can't influence how you see a film; it should be able to stand on its own.  For me, """"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"""" is slightly above average, but not worthy of the recognition it got."""
tt0190332,6,"""I finally got around to seeing CROUCHING TIGER , HIDDEN DRAGON at the weekend . It`s a movie of almost legendary status but I was slightly disappointed with it for one reason that I`ll come to shortly . First of all may I just point out that there`s a lot of acclaim that is justified , it`s a beautifully made film down to its technical areas like the cinematography ( Check out the final stunning scene ) the editing , the soundtrack and the choregraphy . It also has a sense of humour best summed up in the scene at the tea house but this scene - Indeed the whole movie - is let down by something and that something is this : It`s obvious the fleet footed characters are being pulled up and down on a harness . No matter how much the production team try to disguise it it`s obvious this is how the technique is achieved and spoiled the film for me greatly Am I cruel cynic ? Well maybe but think about this : Would LORD OF THE RINGS have been such a sucess if it was painfully obvious that Gollum was a CGI character ? Never once did I believe Gollum was anything less than a real character . Even to this day I have visions that Gollum now sits at home anxiously waiting for Peter Jackson to ring him to tell him he`s starring in THE HOBBIT , that`s how convincing he was to me , but CROUCHING TIGER , HIDDEN DRAGON fails because as soon as I saw characters running over roof tops and along tree branches I realised I was watching people on wires .

tt0190332,6,"""What's all the fuss about? This movie is a Japanese romantic drama about male and female roles and a special sword and tons of other stuff. The story is so convoluted, I can't really recount it all. Basically, the film has, as I said, incredible fight scenes and beautiful wide-screen cinematography, but little else. The story is confusing and boring and, with the sole exception of Michelle Yeoh, badly acted (even Chow Yun-Fat!). I gave up on the film about halfway through when they threw in a needlessly long flashback that's a Western!!!! It adds very little to the story. It seems to be there just to up the romance in the movie. Also with such bad acting, you could care less about the characters. Also, the fight scenes aren't that original...Jackie Chan has been doing them in his movies since the 1970s. Also, the film is subtitled...it doesn't bother me but other viewers might not like it. So an overpraised Japanese film. In a few years, nobody will remember this."""

The biggest frustration for me, was that it beat Promising young woman to the best picture Oscar, I don't see it at all.I have to be honest, my opinion hasn't changed a huge deal, it's good, but it's just such a frustrating watch, at times Fern just drives you crazy, she is given opportunities, she just doesn't want to know half the time.The major plus here, Frances McDormand is outstanding, her acting is phenomenal, she is one exceptional talent. You really do get the sense of how hard life is for someone in her situation.I'm not sure the combination of actors and real life people always works, sometimes it feels a little awkward.Chloé Zhao did a good job with the direction of it, much better than she did with Eternals. The cinematography is unbelievable.6/10."""
tt9770150,6,"""Let's get the obvious point out of the way first: Frances McDormand is a national treasure. She may well be the ranking American actress, and she conveys an """"everywoman"""" aura that is almost hypnotic. The lines on her face, a limitation for many actresses, are an outstanding feature for her.Now, as for the movie: As many have observed, there's scarcely a beginning, middle, or end. We're told how Fay got to be on the road, we see a handful of interactions with others, we get some gorgeous cinematography, and repeat; and repeat again. Life isn't half-bad for Fay and the people she encounters; as bad as it gets is a flat tire or a """"helpful"""" friend inadvertently breaking a beloved piece of china. Somehow, there's money to pay for more serious problems. Other reviews have summarized dozens of ways that the life hinted at here is actually far more harsh than we see.In many ways, this plays as the first episode of a limited TV series about being on the road. In my humble opinion, despite the gorgeous sunsets, such a pilot would not have been picked up.One final thing, and perhaps my biggest problem - it's sometimes referred to as the """"observer effect."""" In a movie filled with dozens of """"real"""" people, the interior of a real Amazon, and so on, I found myself constantly wondering about the crew hovering on the edge of the screen with lights and cameras and a director. It really took me out of the movie. Apparently, it worked for the amateur cast; there's a story on the Internet about one of the amateur leads being really moved by hearing a sad story from Fay; once the scene ended, he was stunned when McDormand reminded him that she was acting, and everyone described in the story was actually alive and well. I guess it's great that Ms. McDormand is such a great actress that these real people believed her in real time. But for me, I wondered how real people could melt into being characters in a movie."""

They make up the bulk of the film, as if the makers were thrilled with """"Days of Heaven"""" and it's minimalist photography.

This film is basically a solo effort where we are to get character, motivation, inner thoughts all from McDormand's face in closeup. This could have been a """"Grapes of Wrath"""" type of film, based on its subject matter and milieu.

tt9770150,6,"""'Nomadland' is based on a work of non-fiction - and it shows. It's a well made movie, but not a lot happens. It's the kind of movie where if someone asked you what the plot was it would be hard to answer. You'd basically just say we follow a woman around for 108 minutes while she travels around and changes job a lot. Some people seem to be falling in love with this movie, but I'm not quite sure what they're seeing in it that I didn't.Frances McDormand is critical to this movie being as watchable as it is. She is becoming one of the most likeable and consistent actresses working today. I do prefer her in roles like 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri' where she has a little more sass and edge to her character. Here she is a little flat, but that's more to do with her character not actually having a whole lot to do throughout the film.I guess I just wanted more out of this film. I wanted it to be inspirational or moving or even just thought-provoking. I was hoping for a film more akin to 'Into the Wild'. I did get that sadly, and what I did get was pretty forgettable."""
tt9770150,6,"""Thanks to NSW government's dining and discovering vouchers I eventually get to enjoy this Academy Award winning movie in cinemas after a good few years. And in admiration of its winning three of the heaviest Oscar titles I have to say it is a very revealing although somehow overrated film that depicts the almost subterranean and invisible population in our world.Nomads, together with the homeless, are no new concept in our community. We either see them or hear of them in various ways, via different channels and by any means. Yet we know so little about their lives. It is all too easy to assume that they are problematic people who don't work hard to afford to live in concrete buildings. Yet this movie proves otherwise. A lot of them are decent but probably different people from us, maybe a bit eccentric - to use a word from Fern's sister in the show. It is through this film that I come to understand that going nomadic is in some way, to some extent and by some degree by choice. The fact that Fern (Frances McDormand) not once but twice rejects the offer of staying home permanently with her sister and a former fellow nomad proves so. It is fair to say that we are all creatures of habit and once we get used to one pattern it is very hard to adjust to the other especially when you reach a later age. What strikes me is that Fern cannot sleep well on a real bed inside a house and eventually sneaks into her van and feels secure in her own comfort zone.The mental health problems among nomads are an area of concern too. This population, cut off from the mainstream society, undoubtedly develops loneliness, helplessness, fear and anxiety. Dying cancer patient Swankie's conversation with Fern and fellow nomad Bob's revelation of his suicidal son serve as strong arguments. Yet nomads develop some kind of bond among them. Support yourself and help one another. Goodbyes are not final. That's what I have learned. We may bump each other again sometime down the track, and somewhere down the road.With all the goodness mentioned above this show, however, lacks A-listers, which could have been a lackluster. Yet McDormand manages to up the ante, which proves to be a success. She particularly focuses on challenging figures such as Fern in this film and Mildred in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017).Having said that this film comes nowhere close to winning such big awards due to its inert plot and flat story. Artistic features of this film are kept at a bare minimum, which gives the feeling of flying no-frills Jetstar instead of full service Qantas. And I agree with other reviewers that this is somehow a boring movie. As a person of Chinese background I was somehow caught off guard that Chinese born Chloe Zhao won the Best Director which set high expectations on this show. And this finally proves to be a bit of disappointment.Perhaps we should focus on the positive note on this overrated film and wish the nomads well. The uninspiring ending script somehow reveals the soul of this movie. That is, """"Dedicated to people who had to depart. See you down the road."""" Yes stay safe fellas.Just before I wrap up, the melancholy did linger around for quite some time in my mind just like a black coffee whose bitter taste stays on the tongue even after being sipped. Perhaps this is where the success of this movie lies in."""
tt0120338,7,"""Since I was a teenager in 1997, I can say with some degree of confidence that Titanic was made for teenage girls. Almost all of my female friends of the time adored this movie and paid to see it multiple times in theaters, so I can see why it saw so much box office success. Also, there's no question that when the boat sinks, it's terrifyingly spectacular. However, the real downfall of this movie is the terribly corny dialogue. The script sounds like it was written by adolescents. Plus, the love story is overly melodramatic. I can see why Titanic made a splash, but I only really enjoy the last half."""
tt0120338,7,"""Watching 'Titanic' was like having 2 people wrestle with a remote channel changer. Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white """"A Night To Remember"""" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood. This is life and death...better leave it to luck!7 out of 10"""
tt0120338,7,"""An extraordinary interest still exists in Cameron's film, still argument rages over just how good it is. The timing of its release was significant, the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known, a century which began with such hope and optimism, and in which the Titanic was ironically such a proud symbol. 'A Night to remember' was released amid worries about the Bomb and the feeling that science was again out of control. 'Titanic' amid millennial jitters. The most discussed aspect is the script, there are lines in the film that are moronic, irritating, senseless and just plain dumb. Others were quoted from the U.S.Senate Enquiry, which proves how people then had a better command of language than we do. Why do Jack and Rose board at Southampton when they've come from Paris? Why doesn't the diamond fall out of Rose's pocket going down with a sinking ship? Why doesn't she find it in her pocket on the Carpathia before reaching New York? Why is it that you can be rude to the ship's owner, assault and abuse the staff, 'fly' from an offlimits bow, run through boiler rooms and cargo holds, cause two stewards looking for you to drown, distract the lookouts, climb in and out of lifeboats, damage property, and NEVER get into trouble? Why do the steerage accept rich snooty first class gatecrashing their party? Why, why, why?Too much time is spent on the wrapping footage, though the unseen sunken interiors are breathtaking. The taste of showing the Titanic sinking like a computer game in front of a survivor isn't questioned. The dissolve of the wreck into the pristine ship packs an emotional wallop every time. Winslet isn't a great actress, she plays the same in every film. On Leo, when Titanic leaves port in a classic series of images, we feel his joy. But it's downhill from here.The engine room montage is another classic, but it's looking artificial. Murdoch's feet are all over the deck. The ship looks like it's populated by the Thunderbirds.Relief, Victor Garber arrives as Thomas Andrews and gives the dialogue meaning, conviction, dignity and charm, quite a feat since thanks to Cameron's warped priorities he only speaks two lines. A thing apparent in Rose is how lacking in charm she is, lighting up at table, and indelicate. No Edwardian. And as this film isn't subtle, but whacks you on the head and biffs you in the stomach we must have the class speech straight away. Tommy Ryan is the most irritating character I've seen on screen and completely unlike any Irish I've met. The next situation isn't credible. Isn't there a better way of introducing these two than the unbelievable jumping off the stern. There is one good line in the dull walk and talk that a first class wench would have said 'This is MY part of the ship' huffs Rose. But with the spit scene any hopes of a romantic wallow are dead.The cheek of the dinner party is how Jack Dawson, somebody who if Rose had chopped his hand off with the axe, would have been pushed to earn a living, has the temerity to lecture a brilliant engineer, a captain with 40 years experience and captains of industry on how to live life, when he hasn't started shaving himself. We need a unmaterialistic message in films, even if it would come better from a director who hadn't overspent his budget by $100million. But the portrayal of rich and poor is straight out of a propaganda film for the gulag.It's a pity, there is such a brilliant Irish band on board, and there aren't equally brilliant dancers.Whether the film has a Christian message at the core or if it's proclaiming that doing your own thing is more important, it's hard to say. The divine service was open to all classes so Jack being turned away is misleading and pointless. A stunning scene on the bow but there hasn't been a romantic exchange yet between this couple that convinces us. Such models of taste and discernment and the brightest thing they say about Monet is that his use of colour is extraordinary. The funniest line in film history: 'This is a ship, only so many places she could be'. The next shot: Titanic bowling merrily along. A thousand rooms!The iceberg finally turns up, the collision is breathtaking, the acting top notch and inseparable from the historical event even if Titanic hits the only iceberg in the whole Atlantic. The surreal party with music and lifejackets shows Cameron can write. Sometimes. But Jack manacled up is tedious and the crew wouldn't have done that on a sinking ship. The real story is lost in Rose running around. The lifeboats when we see them are done far better than any other version, and the timeline makes perfect sense.Titanic alone and helpless, a tiny ship with a futile rocket in an empty ocean is inspired. The film takes on a different dimension and has a touch of the sublime. The images that accompany the hymn are elegiac and perfect. The choreography around the last two boats can't be surpassed. Now we do feel a sense of the panic and despair. The water through the dome, a baptism of fire. No one can fail to be moved by the 20 minutes of terrible destruction. The lifeboat scenes couldn't have been done better, and the Carpathia is a painting brought to life. How exactly Rose retains her incognito through the years when she's a publicized actress, an aviator and everything else in the known universe isn't explained. The ending is a straight pinch from 'Somewhere in time' which did a better job of a love story set in 1912. The frustrating thing is how many things ARE done well. There are gems of writing and acting. It looks terrific. But it proves that you can recreate the cutlery, carpets, staterooms, clothes, but it's so much harder to recreate history. It isn't 1912. And half the film isn't Titanic."""
tt0120338,7,"""TitanicIn 1912, The Titanic was transporting 2,240 passengers to the United States. Four days later the ship hit an iceberg, only 706 people survived. Years later, in 1997, Cameron wrote, directed, and co-produced a movie based on these true events. It stars Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Gloria Stuart, and Victor Garber.This movie tells a story about two fictional characters, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet). They are from too different social classes, Jack doesn't have a lot of money, where Rose's family is rich, along with her mom wanting her to marry into a wealthy family.The combination of practical affects, CGI, and set designs, made everything including the ship sinking look real. The water scenes were filmed in water tanks and made to look like the Atlantic Ocean, this is an impressive accomplishment of the crew.Winslet does a good job portraying someone who is carefree, yet doesn't like her life with her fiancé she's supposed to marry. DiCaprio plays a charming guy who teaches Rose that she can just be herself. Together, they make a convincing couple. Its obvious Jack loves Rose, due to the decisions he makes towards the end. Billy Zane gives a strong performance, as he makes the audience dislike him, because of how he mistreats Rose. Titanic is a romantic yet sad movie, based on a tragic true story."""
tt0120338,7,"""Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%."""
tt5052448,7,"""As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing """"Get Out"""" several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to. This is not to say that it's not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it's his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be """"unpeeled"""" (pun intended) on repeat viewings. The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance. So, what doesn't work as well? Essentially, it's the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It's an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there's been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons. Provided you're not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, """"Get Out"""" is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film."""
tt0449059,7,i entered the cinema after reading all these reviews thinking great I'm gonna see something that is great well it fell short of great but not by far. The most touching parts being the end which had me bent over laughing the whole time and the part between olive and her grandfather where as in the trailer it said am i pretty anybody who has a little sister cousin or child will relate to her as being what you would like your child to be full of life and while impressionable independent. i loved the ice cream bit and her clothes cracked me up one of the best parts was frank and the teenage son walking in to the pageant and walking straight back out again. an enjoyable film which will be remembered for its ending id pay to see it again :D

It shows the struggles of a young fighter as he attempts to turn his life around after always living in the shadows of his brother. How he faces dilemma's when confronted with his family and newfound love interest (amy adams) about what is good for his career. Walhberg does a good job with his role but the supporting cast take the cake. Bale, Melissa Leo and Adams all acted incredibly and are worthy of the awards. This just shows how well acted this whole film is."""

tt0964517,7,"""Look, i like the film, I think it's awesome but I also think were the characters were played by less effective actors, this wouldn't be as awesome as it is. The biggest fault for me, is that the main character has less personality than most sports characters in sport films. Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) has a crackhead brother, former boxing great played flawlessly by Christian Bale, and he has manager-mom played by brilliant Melissa Leo. Mark Wahlberg has range, he is a good actor, but Mickey just fell flat for me. I wasn't invested much in Mickey so when the boxing matches came on, I didn't care much. But the performances by the backup cast are fantastic. If anything, that's worth the concession price."""
tt0964517,7,"""On the rise to fame and success, a young boxer must decide whether to continue training with his family or seek professional training and management elsewhere in this sports drama based on true events. Mark Wahlberg is solid as the conflicted boxer in question and Amy Adams does well cast-against-type as his foul-mouthed bartender girlfriend, but is Christian Bale who steals every scene he is in as Wahlberg's older brother. A former boxing legend himself, Bale has delusions of grandeur and believes that the TV crew who have recently arrived to film him are making a documentary about his long awaited comeback when in reality they are making a film about his descent into heroine addiction. The overall film fascinatingly follows this structure too, opening with a lot of focus on Bale, only for Wahlberg to be eventually revealed as the true star (what a great metaphor for Bale's character coming to realise that not everything is about him). Melissa Leo also gets quite a bit of screen time as the brothers' overbearing mother, however, the rest of the family are disappointingly barely fleshed out all, including Jack McGee as Wahlberg's father, who could have been quite interesting given that he actually sides with Adams about his son's career. As for the sisters, they are all interchangeable stereotypes. This is, however, principally a film about the brothers and their every interaction is compelling. The end credits are also worth watching here for appearances by the brothers whose lives the film was based on - Dicky and Micky Ward."""
tt0964517,7,"""The Fighter is based on the true story of boxer """"Irish"""" Micky Ward's unlikely rise through the ranks to the WBU (World Boxing Union) light-welterweight title.Micky's story would be a conventional sports film if not for the presence of his half-brother Dicky, a boxer-turned-trainer whose life was screwed up by crack addiction and the petty crimes that associated with that life.The brother, played by Christian Bale, makes the story interesting and charges it emotionally. Bale bursts from the skin of his character, igniting every frame with his energy (reminding, occasionally of his role as the high-energy boy in Empire of the Sun). As in The Mechanic, Bale lost a lot of weight preparing for the gaunt crack-addicted brother. He was 100 per cent convincing.Bale's character, Davy, exudes personality every time he enters a room or walks down a street. You know he is a drug-addled screw up and you know he is going to mess up his brother's life, but the brother loves him and is loyal to him so you want to see Davy rise above his problem.One of Bale's best scenes was shot on the front porch of the house where Charlene, Micky's girlfriend (played by Amy Adams) lives. Clean and sober after eight months in prison, Dicky carries a ton of baggage to that porch. He has hurt people. He has conned neighbors. He has disappointed everyone but his mother and his half brother. The entire town of Lowell, Massachusetts remembers Dicky as a boxer (""""The pride of Lowell"""") but they also remember him being addicted to crack, so nobody is prepared to believe he has gotten past the addiction during his eight months in prison.On the porch, Micky, knowing that he carries that baggage, wants to charm Charlene and patch things up for his brother. Charlene, however, is fueled by her complete distrust of Davy. She loves Micky and she has seen Dicky mess up Micky's life over and over again. On the porch, she has just walked away from Micky because he insists on being loyal to Dicky. No way is she going to be easily convinced that Davy has changed.She is skeptical of every word to come from Dicky's mouth, but Dicky pulls out all the stops in an effort to overcome his baggage and connect with her to make things right for his brother.The immovable object meets the irresistible force. It is a fine scene.Amy Adams is equally amazing in this film. As an actor, she is gutsy. Even when she started to command bigger paychecks, she continued to make independent films and bring to those indie films performances that made them better than they might have been. She never shies from a challenge. In this role she plays a worldly bartender who flunked out of college despite a full scholarship in high jump. As an athlete, she can understand with Micky.In the final analysis, it is Amy Adams who makes the chemistry work between Charlene and Micky. Wahlberg can be as wooden as Ben Affleck when it comes to romantic subtleties. Amy Adams in this role is like one of those good dancers on Dancing With The Stars who has to work with a partner who might as well be a post or a tree stump. While Wahlberg is unmoving, Amy Adams' performance reaches out and emotionally draws the scenes together.The Fighter has dimension to it, and a lot of the depth from the supporting cast.The mother played with conviction by Melissa Leo. She runs a family home surrounded by seven adult daughters, and all seem to either be living at home or visiting their mother a lot. The sisters are a hoot, sort of like a Greek chorus on a living room couch. Highly emotional, the sisters hate Micky's girlfriend. I loved them because there was something fascinatingly hideous about the sisters.Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, and Cinderella Man are all fight films that have taken the viewer where The Fighter goes. No surprise there. Micky, as you expect, gets the crap beaten out of him. He struggles through the rank. He gets his shot at a title and he enters the ring against a better boxer to compete for a world championship. The sports genre always travels down a well-beaten path and always takes us to a happier place. Every sports film tells this oft-told tale. You enjoy the genre because getting there is what makes sports films a pleasure.The Fighter benefits from the fact that it is not just a sports film but a story of family and redemption. You family is important, addiction is not unbeatable. The Fighter is a feel good film with a lot of ugly stuff to overcome.IAlthough I put The Fighter along side most of the other boxing films, it could have been a lot better. If Micky had been more three-dimensional, the film might have been a classic. The elements are there, struggle and redemption. It's a true story with a lot of subtext, and that alone makes it better than Rocky. Unfortunately, Wahlberg is no DeNiro so it's no Raging Bull, and the script isn't up to Million Dollar Baby.That said, The Fighter is worth seeing. You'll like it for the performances by Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Melissa Leo and character actors whose faces you'll recognize from dozens of other films and television performances. You will love it for the feel-good arc, the love and redemption that are built into this genre.If you like boxing, you'll love the action. The camera work in the ring scenes is first rate and convincing. On the big screen, you feel every punch.However, if you are of that generation that hates boxing but likes cage fighting, there's no hope for you, sorry"""
tt0388795,7,"""Controversial on a number of levels, yet tame by a number of standards, this is a film that will reach its audience in different ways, depending on their own personal journey - whether gay or straight. How we receive this movie - and how we relate - is indicative of where we're at in our own lives - and this is what makes this film brilliant. We follow the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) who fall unexpectedly in love during a stint as a pair of sheep herders in Wyoming during the 1960's. What follows is the struggle to keep their desires hidden from a prejudiced society and the agony of remaining committed to their marriages while living double lives. There is a consistent undertone of melancholy throughout this film, from beginning to end, and some viewers will find this heavy. But this doesn't detract from the point conveyed by Ang Lee, its director. The impressive feature of this movie is the fact that every actor puts in a solid performance - in particular some of the """"peripheral"""" actors - and this is quite rare in films where quite a number of the performers have very small roles. (Look at Anna Faris 'Lashawn Malone'; Kate Mara 'Alma Del Mar, Jr.', age 19; and Roberta Maxwell 'Jack's mother' for outstanding examples.) In terms of the main actors, Michelle Williams is outstanding, and Anne Hathaway almost steals the show! The only thing that seems to leave the film falling flat is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a positive resolution. Some will take this as an indication that gay men will end up facing tragedy and be confined to a life of loneliness. And we all might need to watch this with English subtitles, because for a majority of the film, we cannot understand what Heath Ledger's mumbled dialogue! This is incredibly disappointing - particularly considering that he delivers the very final line in the film and I am still unable to figure out what it is! (I'll have to get the DVD and throw on the subtitles!!) However, this film certainly does provoke an emotional response. And whether that response is one of anger, disgust, sadness, happiness, elation, denial, self-loathing, confusion, relief, empathy or curiosity, you are alive during those two hours. Highly recommended."""
tt0388795,7,"""There was a lot of talk about this film, a lot of publicity because of the gay interest in the script, and like always when there is too much talk, I don't pay for a seat because there are a lot of clever marketing scams around these days.It went away and then it was in my video store. I waited. Then it went on """"3 for a week for a fiver"""" and I rented it. Ang Lee did a great job there, not only in shooting a difficult story, but also with exceptional photography (it looks like an ad for a cigarette brand, but I don't remember which) and brilliant acting and bringing us back to the US in the 1960s.The story itself, about a secret love affair, is dealt with cleverly, and with qualities in the script, in the performance, and without cheap and easy voyeurism, which in itself is admirable of Ang Lee. Heterosexual love is the subject of so many films that directors lack practise in treating homosexual love, and with the controversy around Brokeback Mountain managing to get through the minefield was not easy. I felt a bit that only one of the two cowboys was in love with the other - but this is an opinion only, but most importantly it seems to me that Brokeback Mountain deals also with the eternal topic of forbidden love, and in that way manages to send the gay aspect of this love to the background"""
tt0388795,7,"""The first mainstream gay western (Warhol's 'Lonesome Cowboys' can only be described as niche or cult), 'Brokeback Mountain' was the surprise hit of 2005, another triumph for the talented director Ang Lee (who also gave us such diverse films as The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the cowboys who start working together and find an intense sexual attraction which will continue to burn for twenty years. The film covers those two decades as we watch the idealistic Jack, who dreams of acceptance and a life with Ennis out on the ranch, and the tormented, disturbed Ennis (who remembers gay cowboys being murdered in his youth), who can't connect with anyone and anything other than his lonely soul.Extremely slow in pace, and all the better for it in an age of fast, rushed films for the MTV generation, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a love story just as valid as any other. For a mainstream movie to even address some of the issues looked at here is amazing, and the film benefits from sensitive direction, low-key romantic scenes, and total commitment from the leading actors. Gyllenhaal is better than he was in 'Donnie Darko', but he is overshadowed by Ledger, who shows here what a fantastic actor he was. It is a tragedy that his early death has robbed us from seeing this talent grow. Here in this film he resembles a young James Dean in 'Giant', playing older than his age with ease.Not an easy film to watch, then, but it repays close study and patience, and some of its lines and images will stay with you for a long time after the credits roll. Proof that intelligent cinema can still survive in the age of blockbuster action flicks."""
tt0388795,7,"""I made it a point not to read any detailed summaries or reviews of this movie before going to view it. I am so glad I did. The scenery was breathtaking and almost surreal. The cast completed each other almost perfectly. Heath Ledger's performance will be discussed for years to come, as well as Jake Gyllenhaal's. You cannot leave from this work of art without being affected by it. This was a beautiful and extremely touching portrait of a love story between two people that I can only classify as universal. Go see it and form your own opinion; I think you will be profoundly surprised. I honestly feel this movie will change cinema as we know it."""
tt0388795,7,"""I think this movie is very interesting and exciting.It talks about two men work together.I think gay couple can be accepted because love is free.Although this movie is not accepted by Christians because gay couple is not accepted in the Bible but many people are very interested in this movie. Boy or girl is not a big problem,the most important is your choice. I think we should not care about how other people feel about you because of being gay couple.I think they should not give up. But they should tell their family about that.I think this is the best movie that I haven't seen before and I think I have learnt a lot of things from watching this movie. I like it so much !"""
tt0190332,7,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a good and fun watch, but I can't help but feel it was missing a few elements to make it as epic as I was expecting.It is practically faultless in terms of its beauty. From the cinematography of the Chinese landscapes, the gentle and calming score, to the flowing and rhythmic martial arts, it is a joy from that perspective.The performances were all very good, and the characters interesting. However I felt like the plot was somewhat lacking. It didn't fully draw me in and was definitely the weakest part of the film. It ebbed and flowed in terms of its quality and perhaps lacked a bit of focus in some parts.Despite all this, I did enjoy watching this film. It has some incredible action scenes and is full of beauty and wonder. Definitely a worthwhile watch."""
tt0190332,7,"""I always have time for films that dare to be different and that faith was stretched to the limits with CTHD. The story is set in feudal China and centres around an ancient (even then!) sword that is stolen by person(s) unknown.Real star of the show is Ziyi Zhang who comes across as a kind of young female Bruce Lee, although somewhat aided by the ability to defy gravity - director Ang's claims that she could not fly, but perform great leaps and falls!(Sorry Lee - I know flying when I see it!)The film starts with a murky and talky set-up that introduce us to the three principle characters played by Chow Yun Fat,   Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh. From their talk-talk it seems they have all acquired mystical living and fighting skills although I would not be like to explain the full in-and-outs of it!Thankfully the silly talking stops and  movie starts to kick-off in earnest when  Zhang is kidnapped on the way to her marriage of convenience. This is where the film really works (as an action movie) and indeed some of the set pieces are classics, although aided and abetted by skilful fly-by-wire work.I don't understand is why the script wasn't re-written to make the characters background  clearer, their skills highlighted (is Zhang hitting with normal powers for someone of her height/weight or superhuman powers?) and then get the whole show on the road earlier. Maybe I missed a few things while dozing through the slow opening, but I could have done with a bit more help with what follows.The actors all put in solid performances, although only the doll-faced Zhang climbs above the script. Fat seems to be billed as star of the show - perhaps because he is the only recognised actor - but he features only in passing. Equally curious is that his love for stunt-happy Yeoh seems understated, but perhaps that is the Oriental way?Plenty of plus points for having strong females characters that hold their own in all aspects of life, but the mystical soup doesn't deliver anything like the classic  some people think they are seeing. The real battle in this movie fights isn't between good and evil, it is between sense and silliness. Sense wins wins in the end, but it is a close call..."""
tt9770150,7,This movie definitely does a good job of immersing you in the world of being a nomad. One of the best things about it is the performances it gets from the real-life nomads who are in this movie. What's interesting though is that as it goes on it is less about this nomad life and more about one person's grief from losing her husband. It was very frustrating at times watching Fern say no to opportunities at a more stable life. I did like the fact that no one in this movie was a bad person. There are moments where you think something bad will happen but it doesn't. Everyone is looking out for each other. It's not the type of movie I would watch again but it's worth seeing once.
tt9770150,7,"""My thoughts on this film: I can see how this movie is not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. I think, if you have even a remote interest in a nomad lifestyle, life on the road, extended road trips in campervans, then you would like this movie. It certainly shines a spotlight on a very small and unexplored part of society. There are actually people out there, in this day and age, who live in vans and travel around, working in different places. Who knew? And how exiting! And how lonely and intriguing. Why would someone do this? I get it, I'm adventurous, but how desolate and maybe even a little depressing. That lifestyle is certainly not for the faint of heart. You have to wonder about the mental health of some of these people, but that's in all walks of life, I suppose. And I think, in a way, that a lot of nomads are scarred in some way, and that's why they keep moving, keep trying to find themselves or something.And then there's the protagonist. Who is she and why doesn't she let people get too close to her? My only really complaint about her character is that they could have given her a little more personality.Ah, the cinematography. Simply stunning.The ending was less than satisfying.Overall, I think it was a lovely movie. I certainly thought about it for a long time afterwards. I don't feel it was best picture award-worthy, but I'm not an Academy member, so I've no say in the matter. A very solid 7 out of 10 IMDB stars from me."""
tt9770150,7,"""Here are instructions to watch this movie as a profound experience:Watch it without researching anything about the background of this movie. (Don't even focus on the awards and nominations.) You'll probably find it slow, melancholic maybe even boring. That's ok, keep watching.Now pay attention to the credits and read the trivia section here and then the page of this movie on Wikipedia. Now read interviews with the supporting actors (e.g. Bob Wells).Now realize what you have just seen..."""
tt9770150,7,"""The cinematography and acting are excellent. The movie is an interesting blend of fiction and documentary. It's slow and somber.

tt0120689,7,"""Frank Darabont as a director has only made 4 films. The most highly rated are """"The Shawshank redempion"""" (1994) and """"The green mile"""" (1999). At first glance these films have much in common. Both adapted from a book written by Stephen King, both situated in a prison and both about the friendship between a white and a black man.In fact the films are far more different than you are inclined to think. """"The green mile"""" is more shocking as it is on death row. The story of """"The green mile"""" also involves a supernatural element that """"The Shawshank ... """" as a more pure character study is missing.The character that contributes the most to the dfference between the two movies is the character of the black man. In """"The Shawshank ... """" Morgan Freeman plays the wise experienced inmate Ellis Redding. In """"The green mile"""" Michael Duncan plays the somewhat ambigious John Coffey. On the hand he is a simpleton, reminding me of Lennie from """"Of mice and men"""" (John Steinbeck). On the other hand he is """"a force of nature"""" (I can't thnk of another discription that would not give away too much of the plot) whose initials only are very telling.Personally I prefer """"The Shawshank redemption"""", which is more of a psycholigical drama. This is not to say that """"The green mile"""" is only plot driven. With a running time of more than 3 hours Darabont takes his time to make individuals of his characters.In """"The green mile"""" the guards are on average much more friendly than in """"The Shawshank ... """". There is one exception by the name of Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison). I think in preparing for his role Doug has taken a good look at Donald Sutherland as Attila in """"Novecento"""" (1976, Bernardo Bertolucci)."""

tt0119488,7,"""Hard to imagine now but in 1997 many of the cast in LA CONFIDENTIAL weren`t well known .

In fact it sounds ridiculous in 2003 but the two best known members of the cast when this was released were Danny DeVito and Kim Basinger The real star of LA CONFIDENTIAL is the script . I`ve never read the novel but I`ve often heard it`s unfilmable . Never once did I get the feeling this was true while watching the film adaption because the only thing to strike me about the script was its intelligence , yes you`ve read that right an intelligent Hollywood script complete with violence , wit and a couple of shocking twists and turns . The only criticism about the story is the old cliche of one of the cops being a naive idealist while the other cop is a violent fascist thug .

tt0111161,7,"""I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes."""
tt0111161,7,"""I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a """"Rocky""""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it."""
tt0499549,8,"""Forgive me, I'm going to jump from professional to fan boy for a while here. I haven't had the jitters after a film the way I've had for Avatar in quite sometime. James Cameron's Avatar is the most entertaining and enthralling cinematic experiences of my life. It is incredible, simply put. What Cameron has done here is the most passionate film project put out since Steven Spielberg released Schindler's List. His attention to detail and his zeal for pushing the envelope is so admirable to any filmmaker or actor who will ever do another film from this point on.Avatar is the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic marine, who replaces his brother on a secret mission to infiltrate the Na' vi, the colony of beings that sit on the planet of Pandora, where there is a precious ore, that sells at a ridiculous amount. When Jake learns the ways of the Na' vi, his feelings and learnings will put him and the people he trusts in dangerous jeopardy.The performances here, in the sense of reacting, becoming, and understanding what Cameron has written are astounding. Not to be confused with a sensational bravura performance from some of the centuries best such as Marion Brando, Tom Hanks, or Diane Keaton; these actors along with the director inhabit these visual transformations with special effects as if they are have lived these beings all their lives. This is all based on character movements and reactions. Sam Worthington, as Jake Sully, is an actor who's on his way to becoming a star. Though he has problems with his Aussie accent often enough in the film, he gets the job done. Zoe Saldana, who plays Neytiri, a Na' vi huntress, is thrilling and electrifying. Stephen Lang, as the rock hard Colonel Miles, takes on a villainous turn to a new level in science fiction. He offers actual emotion and emotes evil to the audience and gains our hatred easily. Sigourney Weaver as the beautiful Dr. Grace, is sufficient enough to have on screen again teamed with Cameron. She lives inside her role with effortless ease, but suffers from some of the typical James Cameron cheesy lines.Narratively the film works perfectly on the cinematic level. The first forty minutes or so require patience and hope as it is the weakest part of the film and offers some dreariness, but when the second act takes off, it's sky high with no limits for James Cameron. Avatar delivers the best action sequences put on film of all time. That is the boldest statement I have ever made in all my years of criticism. I sat on this for two days before charging it out, but I mean it. It is the best visual experience of my life, period.Other than those visuals, the film pops with all the other technical aspects thrown into one. Art Direction is killer as the two worlds blend in perfectly for an acceptable time. The Film Editing is the crowning achievement of the film as it also offers the perfect blend of the two worlds, enticing the viewer and shifting us around. Mauro Fiore is the threat for a Cinematography Oscar this year. It was if the viewer sat down in a chair, put on glasses, and was literally placed on Pandora, spaceships, and floating mountains. The viewer can feel so engulfed by the imagery, you feel like you can smell the leaves from the trees. Avatar is utterly hypnotizing. James Horner's score is some of the best work done in his career. It offers a variable of devastation that moves the viewer to near tears. It goes back to his work on Titanic, where the musical instruments lifted the material immensely. The entire sound team is also locked and loaded for Oscar recognition as the feeling of animals, machines, and arrows buzzing by your head leave you imprisoned in Cameron's exquisite film.James Cameron has come back home ladies and gentlemen Cameron is back, bigger, badder, and mature in his crowning work of his career. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Titanic do not even compare anymore. This is the film that can blend the fans of those two films together and lock Cameron into your heart. He's a definite spoiler for a directing bid for the Academy Awards. You have admire the raw, natural talent the man has. How could you ever conceive such an experience and put that much effort and work into it and have it pay off? The box office success will surely keep him in the minds of voters for various critics' awards. His screenplay, leaps and bounds better than 1997's Best Picture Winner, is primed, developed and ripe for the taking. Though, you do acquire the tacky and atypical dialogue you expect from a science fiction director of this caliber, you can appreciate the effort and the honesty of it all. James Cameron is everything Michael Bay wishes he was, to put it bluntly.Avatar will bring also great actors putting their best foot forward such as Giovanni Ribisi, who is as underrated as they come. Michelle Rodriguez who exudes sexy like any woman starring in a sci-fi epic. Joel Moore, showing his range outside of his comedic work in Dodgeball: An Underdog Story. And the classy veteran actors, CCH Pounder and Wes Studi, who just simply don't work enough.Avatar is one of the best films of the year. The most exciting, thrilling, and superb work you'll feast your eyes on in any theater this century. Cinema, forever, will remember the benchmark that James Cameron placed not only for himself, but for any man, daring to change the game, the way Cameron did. Avatar is a movie experience to be remembered, and please experience in a movie theater first.***½/****"""

Loved the combo Pitt-DiCaprio but loved more seeing some famous characters in this film such as Steve Mcqueen and Bruce Lee, who are absolutely hilarious in the movie! 8/10"""
tt7131622,8,"""Greetings again from the darkness. Hippies, westerns, short skirts, pompadours, catchy pop songs ... all have (mostly) disappeared from our world. Back to save the day and the memories, and twist a little history, is Quentin Tarantino, the ultimate film geek. His latest reminds us of a bygone era of movie stars and old school filmmaking ... a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support. There have been plenty of big screen love letters to Hollywood, but few if any, were filmed with so many personal touches and call-backs to the director's own films.In keeping with the request from Mr. Tarantino, this review will not include any spoilers or details that might negatively impact anyone's initial viewing of the film. It's a reasonable request since the film is so unique and literally packed with nostalgia, sight gags, and historical bits and pieces - some accurate, some not so much. There is a lot to take in and process, and the full impact of the initial viewing might result in awe, shock or disgust ... and maybe even all of the above. So this will be a pretty simple overview peppered with some insight that should enhance rather than spoil the experience.The film covers about 6 months in 1969, but in reality, it all takes place (at least what we see on screen) in 3 days. Leonardo DiCaprio (possibly his best ever performance) plays Rick Dalton, an actor who had a hit (fictional) TV western series in the 50's and 60's entitled """"Bounty Law"""". Since the show ended, Rick has been unable to make the successful transition to movies. For comparison, think of Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and Burt Reynolds - all actors in TV westerns who found greater career success in movies. Brad Pitt (the epitome of cool) stars as Cliff Booth, Rick's stunt double, friend, driver, handyman, etc. While Rick is desperate to find the next stage of his career and fend off being forgotten, Cliff, a Vietnam vet, is accepting of his lot in life. Rick lives in a swanky Hollywood Hills home next door to hotshot director Roman Polanski and his starlet wife Sharon Tate; and Cliff lives in a trailer behind the Van Nuys Drive-In with his well-trained Rottweiler Brandy.There are multiple parallel stories to follow, and a key one involves the aforementioned Sharon Tate. Margot Robbie nails the role and bounces about town with the energy and sweet aura that we imagine she possessed. All 3 of the lead actors - DiCaprio, Pitt, Robbie - have knockout scenes that I'd love to be able to discuss, but I'm not sure how without giving away too much. What I can say is that each of these three talented actors prove that movie stars still exist.This is Tarantino's 9th film as a director (he counts the 2-part KILL BILL as one film), and he claims he will stop making films after number 10. There are multiple features we can count on in a QT film, and a ridiculously deep supporting cast is one. Going through each of the characters played by actors you will recognize would take a page and a half, so I'll cover only a few here. Margaret Qualley is a scene stealer as Pussycat, one of the Manson family girls. You likely remember her from the recent """"Fosse/Verdon"""" or """"The Leftovers"""", and here she fully embraces the hippie look and spirit. Emile Hirsch plays hairdresser Jay Sebring, one of those in the house with Ms. Tate on that fateful night, and Mike Moh plays Bruce Lee so convincingly that I was momentarily confused when he took off his sunglasses. Also making appearances are some Tarantino regulars: Kurt Russell (as a stunt coordinator and narrator), Michael Madsen (as an actor), and Bruce Dern as George Spahn (a late replacement after Burt Reynolds passed away). Others of note include Maya Hawke (Uma Thurman's daughter), Austin Butler (recently cast in the title role of Baz Luhrmann's Elvis biopic) as Tex Watson, Rumer Willis (Bruce's daughter) as actress Joanna Pettet, Damian Lewis as Steve McQueen, Al Pacino as agent Marvin Schwarzs, Dakota Fanning as Squeaky Fromme, and the late Luke Perry as actor Wayne Maunder (""""Lancer""""). 90 year old Clu Gulager (""""The Virginian"""", THE LAST PICTURE SHOW) makes an appearance, and Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich from THE SOUND OF MUSIC) tears into his role with gusto as director Sam Wanamaker. There is even a TV Guide cover featuring the late great character actor Andrew Duggan (""""Lancer""""). Some of these, and many more, are like cameos, but it's still fascinating to see the faces.1969 was 50 years ago, and Tarantino does a remarkable job of recreating the look of Sunset Boulevard, Hollywood Boulevard, Cielo Drive, and studio backlots. Much credit goes to Production Designer Barbara Ling and Set Decorator Nancy Haigh (frequent Coen Brothers collaborator and an Oscar winner for BUGSY). Arianne Phillips does a tremendous job with the costumes that look natural for the time period, and not like something right off the wardrobe racks. Three-time Oscar winning Cinematographer Robert Richardson (HUGO, THE AVIATOR, JFK) is back for his 6th Tarantino film, and he captures the look and feel and vibe of a time that is so personal to the director.It's been three and a half years since THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Tarantino's most recent film, and probably his worst received. This one is clearly personal as it captures the time and place that he fell in love with movies. The dichotomy of rising starlet and fading cowboy as neighbors is a brilliant way to make a point about times changing. This was a time of transition in the United States - a new culture was upon us, and whatever innocence remained, was surely snuffed out on a hot August night in 1969. As usual, his use of music serves a purpose. We are treated to Roy Head, The Royal Guardsmen, and Paul Revere and the Raiders, among others. QT also shows us plenty of bare feet (another trademark). What is unusual is that the film lacks the trademark mass dialogue. This one kind of meanders ... right up until it doesn't.Quentin Tarantino is a living, breathing film geek (that's a compliment) who has earned the right to make the movies he wants to make. This one took him a lifetime to live, 5 years to write, and it will take you 161 minutes to watch. It was warmly received at Cannes, but no one can expect to """"catch"""" everything Mr. Tarantino has served up in one viewing. That said, one viewing will likely be one too many for quite a few folks (especially many under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood). Some will categorize this as an overindulgent nostalgia trip for movie nerds. And they are likely correct. But for those of us who complain that too many movies are remakes, re-treads and comic books, there is no denying Tarantino delivers a unique and creative viewing experience - and it's not meant for everyone."""
tt5052448,8,"""I'll say right off the bat, I didn't really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn't know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out. Get Out surprised me for a number of reasons. The first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that It truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is.And secondly this was the work of a first time director. It's rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park. And lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.Is it a perfect movie? No it isn't, but it's damn good especially if you're in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones."""

If you tried to make a stand, put a halt or raise a hand, the mighty structures that surround, would envelop and impound, one for all and all for one, will ensure you'll soon be gone, but be under little doubt, that you're never getting out.An outstanding piece of cinema and satirical observation with added barbs."""
tt5052448,8,"""Jordan Peele's strong directorial debut got well deserved Oscar attention, as it's unique, intelligent, and often times subtle storytelling made for a well layered, suspenseful film experience.It is hard to say one actor out of the supporting roles stuck out as they all performed so well, but Daniel Kaluuya in the lead role as Chris was superb. His usage of facial expression and body language played so well to his character, and in a movie with plenty of good qualities about it he shines.Jordan Peele also uses a lot of subtle imagery that contributes well to the themes and tone of his story, which is notably impressive especially for a first time director and make for rewarding second, third and maybe even more repeat viewings.This movie is not without faults however, as there is a handful of times where characters inexplicably act strange seemingly just for the audience, and like most horror movies coming out recently it has it's pointless, shrill music stabs to emphasize a silly jump scare. Despite it's faults, I would still highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an intriguing story."""

tt5052448,8,"""Jordan Peele's directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues. The cinematography, tropes, and soundtrack echo horror, but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isn't racist by claiming, """"I would have voted for Obama for a third term."""" Before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy, it mines the horrors of racism. The social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense. Delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a Jordan Peele creation, GET OUT is simply amazing."""

tt0449059,8,"""Sheryl Hoover (Toni Collette) is trying hold this crazy family together. Her brother Frank Ginsberg (Steve Carell) is just released after his suicide attempt. Her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a bad motivational speaker who is always talking about winning except he's a loser himself. Her son Dwayne (Paul Dano) is tired of his family, and has vow to be silent. Grandpa Hoover (Alan Arkin) was kicked out of his nursing home for misbehaving. Finally daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is so excited about getting into the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.The reason this movie works is that I love these characters. I love everybody except for the dad. They are just so weirdly likable. They are the essence of an underdog story. I love this family, and it's not only for the cute little girl. I even love the VW van."""
tt0449059,8,"""I get so disgusted with Indie films about deep characters that have no real personality. Everyone says that they're real because they suffer, when really it's the audience that suffers most. Movies are not supposed to take two hours of my life and leave me feeling vacant and hopeless. I want to spend those two hours with good people who are flawed, like those in my life I love most.That's what Little Miss Sunshine has, and much more. In the beginning, you won't be sure whether you like anyone. By the end of the movie, you'll wish they were real so you could get to know them better. Their history and their dreams about the future. Bravo, Michael Arndt, for creating something truly memorable."""
tt0449059,8,"""It would be unfair to limit the film to one adjective. But charming is the first one that comes to mind. I really don't know how they did it, but the screenwriter Michael Arndt and directing team Dayton/Faris (Jonathan and Valerie, that is) have managed to create a movie in which we are simply so connected to the characters it's frightening. This is a very quirky bunch, and while their traits can be found in everyone we know, they are certainly extremely weird and I certainly don't know any families who are quite as odd as the Hoovers. And yet, we forge such a strong bond with each and every one of them, right from the opening pre-title introduction sequence  probably the best character introduction sequence I've seen since Magnolia. These people are just so real! It's unbelievable just how three-dimensional these characters are. They remind me of The Squid and the Whale  another recent movie that comes to mind when I think of this type of character development  these are just normal, regular people, and the filmmakers developed them as such in the most in-depth, well thought-out and just ingenious way possible.That brings me to the second adjective: Realism. If you've seen the film you know that some pretty wacky things go on in it, but in the end, these people are just plain real. They are real human beings  at least we the viewing audience come to believe. If they weren't so incredibly well thought out and detailed and rounded, we wouldn't forge such a strong bond with them. But fact of the matter is, the Hoovers have quickly become one of the most memorable cinematic families. Their traits. Their flaws. Their dreams and ambitions. Their dynamics, mannerisms, nuances. Every tiny little detail about these people is just so incredibly portrayed.Obviously, it would be unfair to say that a comedy isn't funny. When Little Miss Sunshine gets funny, it's hilarious  we're talking pitch-black dark and very quirky comedy, but it works admirably, reaching sort of a peak in the infamous, hilarious and totally wacky traffic cop scene.The acting is. Simply put, amazing. You won't see any Oscar moments here, no characters that have some particular traits that require various forms of """"method acting"""" to perform. This is simply actors playing a bunch of people who they are clearly quite unlike, but playing them as if they are. The shining star is young Abigail Breslin, who out-acts pretty much all of her older cast-mates. How she can embody a completely other character at such a young age is completely beyond me  and she's been doing it since age 6! Dakota Fanning, watch out! Paul Dano, the other young actor, also delivers an amazing performance. Myself being fresh out of that period of my life, I can say that his portrayal of a frustrated teenager  specifically in the scene where he just explodes (those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about) is just so true and realistic. Arkin is brilliant as the old grandfather, who is at once quite annoying and vulgar and at once the most human of all the characters. The three adult leads also deliver wonderful, nuanced performances  Toni Colette, who has quite a streak of wonderful performances in various films, particularly impressed me.But what makes the film so special is its message  and even more so, how it delivers it. Basically, the film's message can be summed up in one brilliant line delivered by Arkin's character, Grandpa Edwin: """"A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning he doesn't even try."""" This is a family who see tragedy after failure after disappointment, and it's just so, so sad to see them so down, because we love them all and we know that they don't deserve it, despite all their flaws. Seriously, this movie is absolutely brutal to its characters. But ultimately, it's absolutely inspiring. Because despite disappointment after tragedy after blow to the stomach, this family just keeps their head up and say """"so what; we'll find another way"""". Their determination and devotion despite all the obstacles in their way, and their ultimate removal from their anxieties and un-winding is simply and absolutely inspirational, and extremely heartwarming.The flaw of many independent films that carry a message is that they insist upon themselves. Sometimes it works admirably  a recent example I can recall is The Fountain; it's undeniably pretentious, but by fulfilling its own expectations it works as a message film. Little Miss Sunshine delivers its message in simply the most incredibly, charmingly sweet, pure, honest, and innocent way you could ever imagine. It's just so pure. And that's really the single most engaging and appealing aspect of what is already an amazing piece of work."""
tt0449059,8,"""Most people have commented on the brilliance of the acting in this movie. I agree with all they said. Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin are as good as we would expect them to be. Add sensitive and characterful performances from Paul Dano & Steve Carell. Spotlight the amazing Abigail Breslin as a believable little girl trying to break into the Child Glamour Business through pageants like """"Little Miss Sunshine."""" It was when I contrasted her less than movie-star appearance with all the adult-glam of the other lacquered and made-up girls that I realized the subliminal message here.Olive's striptease is an honest (but disturbing) expose of what these pageants really are. It's only when Olive's family join her in making this into a game that we can begin cheering for her while being horrified by the hypocrisy of the whole pageant-thing.A brilliant movie!"""
tt0964517,8,"""After Rocky, Raging Bull, Ali, Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella man, and many others, one begins to wonder how many more boxing movies we really need in the world, and what a new one can bring to the table. Indeed, watching The Fighter, one can't help but wonder what the film can do to renew the genre and bring something new to the table. Unfortunately, the answer is """"nothing much"""". The script is a pretty conventional rags-to-riches story, whose most interesting element is the relationship between Micky Ward and his brother, Dickie Eklund. Luckily, Russell and company recognized that this was the strongest aspect of what is otherwise a good but ordinary and somewhat flawed script, with some problems with flat characterizations and unnatural-sounding dialogue. However, everyone involved in the film tries their best to transcend the script, and for the most part, they succeed.Russell's direction is absolutely fantastic. His use of the camera – which still has that indie looseness, free-moving and hand-held and gritty quality to it, which really adds to the atmosphere and energy the film tries to capture. His staging of scenes is fantastic and he usually just lets his actors riff off of one another, sometimes sticking to the script but sometimes talking over one another, interrupting, and creating a very dynamic back-and- forth that further lends to the realistic quality of the film and its setting. A fantastic rock- oriented soundtrack only adds to this energy and atmosphere. In terms of bringing something new to the table of boxing movies, Russell employs a very interesting technique of filming the boxing scenes as they were shown on HBO pay-per-view TV in the 90's; cheap video quality, multi-camera set-ups, the whole package. The boxing scenes were all shot over 3 days, which left the crew just enough time to run through one boxing match at a time and just shooting it as if it were an actual match, the cameras capturing everything, including mistakes and mess-ups and spontaneous, uncontrolled occurrences which yet again add to the very loose and realistic style the film attempts to capture. It is a very interesting and unique technique I have not seen used before, and I thought it was a fresh approach to boxing scenes, which have become very conventional ever since Raging Bull.Ultimately, though, this is a movie about two brothers and their overcoming demons and obstacles in order to succeed and reach their mutual goal, together. Being a character-based film, the success of the acting is a key to the success of the film, and luckily, it is in this field that the film succeeds the most. Mark Wahlberg is adequate in the lead role of Micky Ward. I have never thought much of him as an actor and think that he did an """"okay"""" job on this film; not bad but not particularly noteworthy. However, his supporting cast all shine, and his chemistry with them, especially with Christian Bale, is really what sells the movie for me. Bale's achievement is nothing short of revolutionary. He completely steals the show as Micky's crack-addicted older brother and trainer, a former boxer himself, and a shadow of his old self, except he can still throw one hell of a punch and knows just what Micky needs to do in order to succeed. Bale completely embodies the role and really gives it his all – both in his appearance (hollow cheeks, bulgy eyes, balding) but also in his bravura performance. It is an incredible feat of acting, one of the best I have seen all year; Bale's best work as an actor yet, and totally deserving of all the accolades it will inevitably receive. Also worth mentioning though are the two main female supporting roles, namely Amy Adams as the tough and sassy but supportive girlfriend, and Melissa Leo as the overbearing mother. Both actresses are very much out of their comfort zone, which is just what makes their performances so good. Adams, who has never really shown her tough side like she does in this film, does a spectacular job, and really creates someone human and relatable out of what is otherwise an underwritten character. The same goes for Melissa Leo: her character could have gone the completely one-dimensional villainous way, but Leo adds a certain humanity to the character which just makes her seem more sad than vicious.Ultimately, The Fighter tells a pretty conventional story in an interesting and not necessarily conventional way. It is a film that could have been over-dramatized and heavy-handed had it been put in another director's hands (see Cinderella Man for an example of over- dramatization), but Russell and his cast reign it in and set out to create a very specific atmosphere and set a particular mood that lends the film a sense of realism and a very unique dynamic energy that, with the help of the fantastic performances from the cast, help carry it above and beyond its conventional script."""
tt0964517,8,"""A documentary crew is following Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale) and his half-brother Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg).

He's trained by Dicky and managed by their mother Alice Ward (Melissa Leo). Micky is taken by bartender Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams). When Micky's opponent drops out, he's paired with a fighter with 20 lbs on him. Micky is resistant but Alice and Dicky pushes him into the fight.Christian Bale delivers an incredible performance that is matched by the great Melissa Leo. Both deservedly win their Oscars. The family dysfunction is crazy compelling. Amy Adams is also great. Wahlberg is a bit stiff but that's probably due to the amazing acting happening all around him. The movie is surprisingly funny. When the girls rush over to Charlene's house, girl fight and hilarity ensues. The only limiting thing are the boxing sequences. They're not the best but that's not the focus of the movie."""

I think the director's contribution in this regard is huge; filming the movie with images specific to that era to reflect the boxing matches of the time made the film much more original, truly commendable.Another aspect is the acting. Everyone is really above average, but there is one name that is amazing - Christian Bale. He truly deserved the Oscar with an extraordinary performance, he is a great actor.I know there are some shortcomings in reflecting the truth in the film, as far as I know, but even if some details are overlooked, the film is so enjoyable that it makes you forget all of them. This is the main reason why I give it an 8/10 rating.This film could have been shot in a more dramatic way, telling more about the family's inner structure; maybe it would have been a much better movie, but it could never have been made as entertaining as it is now. Everything in a sports movie is there, it is a perfect evening movie, and a good recommendation.While watching the movie, you won't realize how time passes, I don't think you'll be doing anything else for a moment. David O. Russell did a great job technically, and I congratulate him on that, the screenplay is also quite normal and good. Watch it without thinking."""

tt0190332,8,"""As a film student living in Toronto, I look forward to the Toronto International Film Festival every year.  Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's """"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"""".Being of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.Being an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!Okay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.All in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film."""

tt9770150,8,"""I have to imagine 'Nomadland' is a hard sell for general audiences. There isn't really a plot, per se, beyond what any one-line premise conveys. Yet that's not the intention, anyway: 'Nomadland' isn't narrative fiction. It's a quasi-fictional portrait of America. And in showing us the country we don't see, it excels.Great credit (and much deserved accolades) are due to Chloé Zhao, who not only directs here but also serves as producer and editor, and who also wrote the screenplay. While there are characters, and a loosely scattered progression of events, this is not a conventional film. More than anything I'm reminded of short films of the sort that probe some esoteric concept, with free flow between scarcely related scenes that encourage audiences to draw their own conclusions. It's a style that's a unique challenge for viewer and filmmaker alike, even over a mere 5, 10, 15 minute runtime - and 'Nomadland' is a full-length feature.It does seem at times like the movie leaps too quickly from one scene to another; it becomes difficult to appreciate what one moment is conveying before we move on to another. Yet that also seems a bit appropriate, and intentional: after all, this is a story about modern-day nomads, who move from place to place and see many things without putting down roots. How perfect to capture that same spirit in the crafting of a film?Through that construction, and the scenes laid before us, there is indeed much to glean from 'Nomadland.' Opening title cards and occasional dialogue relating economic and personal, financial hardship work toward that end, as well, but only show a small part of the picture. The feature follows an individual on a journey, yet what it's really about is a lost sense of exploration, freedom, and openness. It's about the bonds placed on us by a society and economic structure that demands endless labor and rigid obeisance; the trade-off of opportunity that comes with uncertainty - and the confinement that stability demands.'Nomadland' explores, through protagonist Fern and the people she meets, the incredible diversity of our country, and the natural wonders it contains, that our societal structure purposefully keeps us from witnessing - a caged animal won't yearn for freedom if it doesn't know what it's missing. It examines the bizarre dichotomy between the found community that pops up in wide, open spaces, and the disconnection that's felt in those places where people live close together.It offers a perspective on poverty, homelessness, and class structure that gets lost for those of us who have known relative comfort. We so often are told to look down upon people who seem to have less, and live different or more austere lifestyles. Capitalism gives us false promises of elevation while also evilly casting any apparent lack - of material goods, of nebulous success - as a moral failing. But it's all a transparent illusion meant to put up walls where true community, and mutual aid, should exist instead. And 'Nomadland' gives us all this and more in the form of scene by scene snapshots, not unlike the glimpses of the independent lifestyle nomads lead.For seeming to do so little, 'Nomadland' says so very much.Zhao wears many hats for this film, and does so deftly, with skills as a writer that matches those of her editing, and direction. There are many beautiful shots in this movie, of landscape and person alike. Zhao expertly captures the far-ranging emotions of her subjects, which apparently includes some real-life nomads portraying fictionalized versions of themselves. That, too, lends authenticity to the picture, and greater credence to the themes and notions it touches upon. Moreover, the somewhat minimalist original score by composer Ludovico Einaudi builds still further upon the emotional heft in 'Nomadland,' to great success.A long time ago I would have said that 'Nomadland' isn't the sort of movie I'm interested in, what with the bare threads of plot and lack of narrative action or conflict. That's certainly not true any more, but it's still not the easiest film to sit through. Because this is a feature where what a viewer sees is far less important than what they perceive between the proverbial lines, and there is a great deal to pick up on as such.I can absolutely see why this has garnered so much acclaim, and so many awards. By the nature of how and why it is crafted, 'Nomadland' isn't going to be for everyone. Yet for those who give it a try and are open to learning, it is a fantastic cinematic experience well worth the investment."""
tt9770150,8,"""This is cinematic patience, a bare and beautifully drawn out experience that paces and feels exactly like the lives and experiences it portrays.

tt0119488,8,"""Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They're all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.This story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don't get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley, a young up-and-comer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.The movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White, Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies, deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other's unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken, a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story's strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith, played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That's all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you're never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.L.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story, with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation's finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It's so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner."""
tt0499549,9,"""You know the feeling when you start watching a movie, realizing it's almost 3 hours, and saying to yourself - """"Well this is probably gonna be mostly boring"""", well, the creators of this movie didn't let that happen, rest assures.From the beginning up until the ending, every scene is perfected, with amazing acting, stunning directing, great visual effects, and astounding sound effects.The story building is just great , characters are well-developed , and the concept is brilliant.The only thing that's missing to me, is a fitting-soundtrack which could've give some scenes a great boost.I avoided watching this movie for a long time, because it just seemed a little ridiculous to me (Come on there are blue people) but I'm so glad I finally decides to give it a chance, and boy did it serve.Loved it. 9.5/10."""
tt0499549,9,"""A film with the scope of James Cameron's Avatar was always going to be a risk both artistically and financially, especially in today's economic climate. Whether it will pay off monetarily is a question only time can answer, but this viewer can at the very least attest to it being an artistic triumph.Avatar brings us as close as cinema ever has to actually visiting an alien world. The beautiful environs, the exotic creatures and incredibly lifelike natives of Pandora arrest the senses, visually, aurally and emotionally. The world in Avatar is the true star of the show. The amount of detail and work that has gone into bringing this new world alive is seriously impressive, and it will be a while before we see anything that overtakes it in scope and quality. WETA Workshop and ILM have truly outdone themselves.Relative newcomer, Aussie Sam Worthington provides a solid human heart amongst all the science-fiction/fantasy beauty and Zoe Saldana gives an impressive performance as the 8 foot tall Na'vi, Neytiri. Even though the characters they both play are blue, giant, catlike aliens, they managed to evoke a chemistry and likability that pierces through the special effects.That's not to say that everything is perfect. The story is basic and dare I say, clichéd and predictable. We have seen it plenty of times in all forms of media. The bad guys are cartoonishly evil, and sadly paper thin. The love story, while charming, is also clichéd despite being between man and alien. But in the face of these shortcomings, Avatar is a success because its storytelling lies in the brilliant visuals.Avatar is a beautiful piece of film and a true event. It does exactly what cinema was always intended to - it takes us away from our problems and worries for a few hours and gives us memorable images which will undoubtedly and deservedly enter into the cultural lexicon to stay for the foreseeable future.9.5/10"""
tt0120338,9,"""If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well."""

It caught my interest when I heard the story about those 5 people who lost their lives on an expedition to the Titanic.I've heard about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it. It's honestly one of the best movies I've seen. I had so many emotions watching it. Laughter, tears, anger, terror etc.The characters were phenomenal. To think of all of those people who really went through pure terror. I couldn't imagine.Needless to say, if you have not seen this movie, please go watch it. I had to add it to my list of favorite movies.Job well done to everyone involved in making this masterpiece."""
tt7131622,9,"""It took Quentin Tarantino a lifetime of living, 5 years to write and a 2 hours 41 minutes watch. This is a love letter to a film industry that is no longer recognisable. Hippies, short skirts, westerns..... all have disappeared from our movie world. But worry not, Quentin Tarantino is here to remind us of old school film making from a once beloved industry which has been described as being on life support.The performances are flawless. I was apprehensive about how the events of August 8, 1969 would be handled. But that is handled tastefully and respectfully, yet with the classic Tarantino flair.Will be quite a bit for those under 40 who have no recollection of this Hollywood. Some will categorise this as an over indulgent nostalgia trip for movie geeks. And they are likely to be correct. But for those of us who complain that Hollywood is reduced to remakes and comic book films, QT delivers a unique and creative viewing experience."""
tt7131622,9,"""Another great Tarantino film, though I do agree there are times where it feels a little indulgent and meandering. The climax of the film is fantastic though, and it does make it feel like it was all worth it for the most part. There isn't really a defined narrative, which may put some people off but Tarantino's sublime dialogue and the great performances make all of the scenes at least entertaining. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it definitely is one of the most original films I've seen in a while."""
tt7131622,9,"""Before watching this film, it is CRITICAL that you have somewhat of a knowledge about Charles Manson (and Sharron Tate). If I did not have my sister next to me pointing out the small references to this serial killer's story, I would not have understood at least 80% of the movie. Understanding the significant details adds a specific intensity in every other scene, like you know something that the characters don't, and always keeps your eyes glued to the screen.Although I can see how a few scenes were fairly slow, and the middle was not particularly engaging, Tarantino definitely had a purpose for each scene, even if I don't have all the answers. Even the smallest of details, like a gun holster of beer or the way the characters drive down the highway, reveals hidden thoughts, feelings, and backstories to the audience. If you do not catch onto these specific details, I can understand how some points seem overindulgent of """"the golden age"""" of Hollywood. But the beautifully nostalgic filming in these moments is what makes this film not only entertaining, but a piece of art.It's the juxtaposition of Sharron and Dalton's storyline, it's the wonder and the dimensional characters, it's the brilliant manipulation of the audience's emotions, causing you to laugh, scream, and cry (sometimes simultaneously) that makes this film utterly perfect.The ending leaves you wondering """"What if..."""" over and over again, questioning what reality would look like if these fictional characters of Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth actually existed. And I think that's when I realized how perfect the title was: it's a humorous, fairy-tale (although not completely violent-free) ending to the tragic fate of Hollywood in the 60s..."""

This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel """"sorry"""" for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!"""
tt5052448,9,"""'Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread. That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes. Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively. Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still. While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most. My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note. Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"""
tt5052448,9,"""Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves."""
tt5052448,9,"""Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in """"Get Out,"""" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo """"Key & Peele"""" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern. In the tradition of """"The Stepford Wives"""" with the twist of """"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,"""" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.With a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.Peele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.Kaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.When a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.Not everything adds up by the end of """"Get Out,"""" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"""
tt5052448,9,"""Ok here goes. Having read the reviews and seeing how polarized they were,, I had to check the movie out myself. To all who regard the movie as racist - I don't think so. Any modern day theme be it racism, sexism, disability issues anything can be used in this movie to highhight the issues being faced by individuals. It is for most part a unique genre in its own right. Take dusk till dawn mix it with some eugenics and a pinch of humour and bingo . Yes it does make you feel uncomfortable but not in a serious way. It's funny in places and very clever in bits. Some beautiful shots and filming and menacing score keep it simmering brilliantly. Watch it make your own mind up. Personally one of the most enjoyable movies from last year. Bravo."""

A HUGE congratulations to Jordan Peele for hitting a HOME RUN, his first time up to bat. Looking forward to future projects from him. GO SEE, GET OUT. 😀😀"""
tt0449059,9,"""It is very rare to see a movie that can charm the hell out of an audience without the use of special effects, worn-out clichés and bombastic action set pieces these days. It's even more ridiculous to hope that you will see such a film for FREE. But that's exactly what happened to me tonight at a sneak preview of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.I """"discovered"""" this movie right here at IMDb, having heard not a peep about it beforehand. By the time I finished watching the second trailer for the THIRD time, I was floored...and hooked. Luckily, the Bulletin Boards steered me toward the proper link to access sneak passes for tonight's showing, and all I can say is that it will not pain me one bit to pay for the privilege of seeing this gem a second time.Assembling the best and most unlikeliest of ensemble casts you may probably see all year, SUNSHINE on the face of it is a relatively (pun intended) simple story. Little seven-year-old Olive (Abigail Breslin) has one wish in life: to be considered for the finals of the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant in Redondo Beach, CA. When her big chance comes at the most unexpected time, it's up to her unbelievably fractured family to pull themselves together and make it happen for her, no matter what it takes.And what it takes is a sad, painful, tragic and yet unendingly hilarious trek in a barely operational VW bus from Albequerque, NM to the Pageant. And although getting there is only half the fun and family drama, you have got to see what happens to believe it when they finally arrive and Olive gets to """"do her thing."""" The strong cast sounds not a single false note, and when the more touching moments arrive, they don't seem forced the way they would in most other big-budget behemoths, because these moments are truly earned. But WHAT a collection of characters this is. Greg Kinnear is letter-perfect as Olive's judgmental, failed motivational-speaker father; Steve Carell finds new shades of darkest despair and human comedy as her suicidal gay uncle, a leading Proust scholar; Paul Dano does amazing things with little more than facial expressions as Olive's older brother who's deep into Nietzche and a vow of absolute silence, and Alan Arkin, though he has played this kind of role with both hands tied behind his back and his eyes closed, still shines like a crazy diamond as her cantankerous and hedonistic grandfather.And barely holding this motley crew together is Toni Collette, who amazes by playing a mother again and yet manages not to portray the role exactly the same way, (you might recall her Oscar-nominated turn as Haley Joel Osment's put-upon mom in THE SIXTH SENSE.) I'm not at all familiar with the work of the two directors, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, or the writer, Michael Arndt, but they have definitely raised the indie film bar with this effort. Not a single moment is wasted; not a single scene is in this film without having a reason for being there, and it's all character-driven. There's also nothing fluffy about it - commentary about everything from how twisted our pop culture can be, to how our drive for being #1 winners can blind us to all of the things that are the most important are all there under the bittersweet laughs and tears for the audience to discover.I can't recommend this one highly enough. And I can't wait to see it again."""
tt0449059,9,"""I saw Little Miss Sunshine a week ago at the Sydney Film Festival, and the audience I saw it with loved it. There was a lot of laughter going on - especially at the hilarious ending. And amidst the jokes it deals smartly with it's theme of the value of chasing your dreams and being one of life's 'winners' versus valuing what you already have. Or put another way, it celebrates the joys of losing in a culture obsessed with winning.I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, as the film hasn't been widely released yet. There are no huge plots twists, but I think you'll have more fun with this film if you don't know exactly where it's going.As the film started I wasn't so sure about it. All the characters (apart from Toni Colette's perhaps) seemed to be written as being amusingly quirky in a predictable indie-comedy way. But as the movie went on it became easier to warm to them. I think it helped that the actors appeared to be having genuine fun together. These guys don't feel like much of a family at first, and I wondered a couple of times why these people would bother sticking together, but as things progress the strengths of this particular family unit become obvious. And just as all comedies should, it gets funnier as it goes on. I was pleased to see the script stayed true to it's messages all the way to the end, and didn't turn preachy or maudlin. The whole cast work excellently together, and I hope this film has all the success it deserves once it's released."""
tt0449059,9,"""Here is a film that lives up to the expectations of a very funny trailer. It's an oddball comedy, and it's dark, and it's funny, and it's touching, and it will charm the pants off many in the audience. Here is a simple story in which our lovely contestant and her family try to find their way to California so that she can prove to the world she is not a loser! The premise itself can lead to years of therapy for a family that should get a group rate in psychiatric care.Expert editing and superb comedic performances from all the principals involved will have many overlook the fact that the plot line is a little too contrived at times. The set pieces will have the audience howling with laughter as we see different characters trying to overcome some pretty irreverent obstacles. The scene at the gas station contains moments of deep sadness and offbeat humor, something that Carrell pulls off wonderfully, and none will be able to look at the trunk of a car, some dubious literary material, and highway patrol the same way after seeing the infamous scene in the film.The best is of course, saved for last, and by this time we are waiting for something outrageous which """"Little Miss Sunshine"""" delivers unapologetically. A classic track will probably be recharged for a new generation, as the bonds of family precariously balance a moment that could be as tacky as they come.""""Sunshine"""" is one of the best things to come out of American cinema this year, an original film that relies on a script that understands the differences between generations in the same family. It doesn't explain why each character is as quirky as can be, and it doesn't build much background because it is not needed to make the film work. Kinnear, Colette, Abigail, Arkin, and Correll are a fine team and keep the film's feel fresh throughout the film. Here is a family that has no special qualities or powers, a family that will make us rejoice that creativity is still alive in Hollywood, a film that will provide us with plenty of much needed sunshine in an otherwise pretty dull summer."""
tt0449059,9,"""It's a big risk when you base your movie around a child. Nine times out of ten it will end in an annoying disaster. The likes of 'Home Alone' are the exception. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a rare case of getting it oh so right. Abigail Breslin was fantastic in this movie.Sure she has an amazing cast of adults around her. But in a way that only makes her performance even more impressive. She is not only holding court with them, she is often showing them up and stealing scenes.There's a tremendous balance of uplifting and heavy material in this movie. It's a feel-good, but it isn't afraid to pull at the heart-strings either. Very few movies find the intricate balance between these two gears as well as this movie does.It's taken me 16 years to finally see this movie but I'm glad I finally did. It is a treasure. 9/10."""
tt0964517,9,"""In many ways, """"The Fighter"""" is the film of 2011. A family drama with a pugilistic background. The punches, physical and emotional in and out of the ring took me completely by surprise. What didn't surprise me was Mark Wahlberg's signature all over the place. Let me explain: Many years ago I was at a lecture by director Martin Donovan when during the Q&A somebody made fun of the fact that Calvin Klein underwear model Marky Mark had played a part (his first acting role) in Donovan's made for TV """"The Substitute"""" Donovan with elegance, wit and firmness destroyed the guy asking the question, describing Wahlberg's strengths and ended up saying """"Mark Wahlberg will be one of the top actors around and he will probably be running Hollywood within a decade"""" I had Donovan's words buzzing in my ears when I sat speechless watching """"Boogie Nights"""". Wahlberg also produced """"Entourage"""" and the startling """"In Treatment"""". He now produced """"The Fighter"""" and his performance, interior and powerful, dominates the film allowing other members of the cast, to shine in truly showy roles, Christian Bale for instance - really good. Melissa Leo is a stand out as the mother/manager. Superb. So I won't be surprised to see Mark Wahlberg receiving the top honors at the next Academy Awards, as an actor and producer. He certainly deserves it. Bravo!"""
tt0964517,9,"""When it comes to winning awards, boxing films seem to always be contenders; as such, the thought of watching """"another boxing film"""" can be off-putting. But """"The Fighter"""" hangs in and fends off those labels, earning every bit of its critical praise. That's because most of the fighting in this film takes place out of the ring; """"Irish"""" Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) spars with the troublesome brother who trains him and his mother who manages him and these superb supporting characters have their own challengers to overcome.David O. Russell brings a needed dose of realism to the boxing genre, downplaying the underdog nature of Micky's true story and focusing on the relationships that push him through and hold him back all throughout his journey toward the welterweight title. Much of the time, in fact, the story feels equally Micky's and his brother's. Dickie Eklund (Christian Bale), as beat over our heads early in the film, went ten rounds with Sugar Ray Leonard and knocked him down, becoming the pride of small working-class town Lowell, Mass. — which as one might imagine, wasn't hard.But Dickie, an off-kilter, fun-loving yet irresponsible guy (a transformative performance from Bale to say the least), spends the time he's not training Micky in crack houses. In fact, he's completely oblivious to the fact that HBO is following him around for their documentary on crack abuse, not one about his """"comeback."""" It's clear that his behavior is keeping Micky, whose had a string of bad losses of late, down. After an embarrassing fight in which Micky was mismatched, Micky suddenly finds himself wondering whether he should keep his boxing career and family separate.The idea of it irritates Micky's mother Alice, played by Melissa Leo, who impressively embodies every controlling mother. Alice sits in her house most days and smokes cigarettes while her seven grown daughters pathetically vie for her attention. Leo keeps Alice from being an aggravating total monster, providing a more complete picture of a mother whose blurred the line between business and family.Amy Adams also excels in her supporting role, a bartender and college dropout, but one who — like the audience — sees how Micky's family has kept him back and as his girlfriend pushes him toward the right path. Interestingly, as she grows more invested in Micky's career, the script divides her from the audience, which gives her performance more weight.Russell's characters have a harsh reality to them, much like the Boston-based characters in Ben Affleck's films """"Gone Baby Gone"""" and """"The Town."""" In addition to looks, clothes and mannerisms, Russell chooses a more hand-held documentary feel for the film like Darren Aronofsky's """"The Wrestler"""" and even opts to film parts of the boxing sequences with lenses like the ones used in the late '90s to give the feel of watching a live broadcast.The fights, though effective, remain secondary to the other """"fighting."""" Watching Dickie spiral downward and come back up again, Alice have trouble letting go and Micky struggle to speak up for himself and recognize what he truly needs serves as the more compelling conflict. All together, they give """"The Fighter"""" the best ensemble cast of 2010. And like all great boxing films, all these tensions blow in and out make their way symbolically into the boxing ring for that final fight. As Dickie urges on his brother in the waning rounds of the championship fight, he captures it perfectly when he says """"everything that's happened, take that out there with you.""""The emotional moments of """"The Fighter"""" do lack a real knockout and many intimate moments are tempered with humor in awkward but not scene-ruining ways, but rather than be a heavyweight drama that rides the underdog story for two hours, """"The Fighter"""" opts to be something a bit more natural by fixing on the right things: the people and the personal relationships that hurt or harm us, are all essential to our success.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"""
tt0388795,9,"""I've always admired this film to a certain extent, but I think the thing that always kept me from loving it was that it never resonated with me emotionally. I would get attached while watching it, but all of those feelings would leave me fairly soon afterward. It had been about five years since I'd seen the film, and in that time I have grown up a lot, fallen in love, had my heart ripped to shreds and fallen back in love again and I think this growth personally has really opened me up to a place in my mind and heart to embrace this film more than most other screen romances that exist. Almost immediately it hit me harder than it had before and after a day since I watched it, the pain and heartache I experienced during it still remains at my core.It's a love film told non-traditionally, but not because it's two men, that doesn't even factor into the depiction of it. It's nontraditional because it's two people fighting against the love and it's accuracy in this is startling. How there are times where you can hate the person you love, hate so many things about them and hate that you are in love with them, but you can't give it up at all. You can't walk away from it because it's like an addiction and I think this film more than any before it captures that remarkably.A lot of this lies in the writing, but of course the performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal certainly play a key factor in capturing it. Their characters take the love in different forms, Ennis fighting himself over it and Jack fighting the world because of it, but both actors capture exactly what they need to and bring this magnetism that really sparks. Gyllenhaal's openness is beautiful, his determination to make the love work and to just exist the way he wants to, he definitely provides the emotional anchor for the film and gives a heartbreaking portrayal.It's Ledger, of course, who steals the show though, with a kind of transcendent performance that we're treated to maybe once a decade. He becomes this character in such a vivid way that you don't even recognize the actor inside the role anymore. Gyllenhaal is Jack and hits the surface notes expertly, but you can still see Jake Gyllenhaal in there. Heath Ledger is completely gone and from the very beginning of the film we have Ennis and we have him until the very end. This character is an incredibly difficult one to take on, he could have easily been someone who was hard to like or sympathize with due to his internalizing and his refusal to fully embrace the relationship and who he is, but that's what makes it hit even harder, thanks to Ledger's brutal work.You see the pain in this person living a lie in every moment we have with him, with that turned in mouth and speech pattern that always sounds like it's hurting him to let anything out because he's afraid of how people are going to react. It's a performance unlike any other out there and in the end it's one that brings me to my knees. """"Jack, I swear,"""" was always a line that floored me when I was watching it but now it's at a point where just thinking of the line and the way that Ledger delivers it brings some water to my eyes."""
tt0388795,9,"""I have viewed Brokeback Mountain a total of three times on a 50 inch plasma. I spaced my views almost six months apart so I could grasp more completely and without prejudice, how I would rate this flick.It is beyond a doubt an American classic and looking back I regret so profoundly the death of Heath, who played Enis. The amount of acting skill and diversity it took to do such a touching and completely honest job, makes this young man, Heath Ledger, a legend.The scenes in the Brokeback were beautiful and allowed me to imagine somehow I was transformed back in time watch these young men.The truth is neither one of the characters was entirely gay, rather bisexual, but they did find each other as their own natural soul mates.Unfortunately cultural prejudice and homophobia prevented them from doing what Jack Twist had dreamed, ranching together on his father's spread.The final scenes are absolutely acted with such depth of character, the viewer is taken to tears. The Brokeback will not have Jack's ashes, since even in death, the culture denies him his final request, his ashes spread upon the Brokeback.Many of the bigots who have posted here on this fine cinema should be ashamed as they bray their ignorance for all to read.A fine film and probably one of the top love stories of all time in film."""
tt0388795,9,"""A really quite remarkable and moving love story between 2 cowboys that transcends any notions of what love between 2 people 'should' be. From their first raw encounter of physical intimacy, to the warmth and compassion that follows, we are taken on a journey of love and despair as these 2 men endeavour to keep alive an impossible relationship in the most difficult and unforgiving of times.Full of passion, daring, hope and despair, Heath & Jake give extremely brave and heartfelt performances in roles that not only would be a formidable challenge for any straight actor, but that will also shake and perhaps change forever the traditional stereo-type of the American cowboy. The courage required to bring this 'forbidden' love story to life on the screen is almost breathtaking, and is fully deserving of any awards that come its' way"""
tt0190332,9,"""I just saw this film today.  I was totally captivated... when it was all over, and the credits began to run, it took me a couple of seconds to realize where I was.  I didn't want to get out of my seat.  And once I got out of the theatre, I couldn't even talk about it for an hour or so.  I kept running the details over and over in my head.  It's rare that a film has such an impact on me.  The cinematography was stunning.  The special effects were beautifully done.  The characters' moves were effortless.  The acting was wonderful.  I really think that Michelle Yeoh should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I thought that the effects and storyline complimented each other brilliantly.  There were so many different layers to the plot.  There were many things that couldn't be explained with dialogue that were expressed in the characters' faces.  This film had lighthearted moments, heartwrenching moments, romantic interludes, inspirational sentiments, wonderful plot twists, superb acting, beautifully done fight scenes, never before seen special effects...it had it all.  Some scenes may have been a little over the top, but it's *fantasy*... and yet, after a few brief moments, it somehow became completely believable. That's how much this film draws you in.  This is a one of a kind film; there is just no comparing it to any other.  It transports you to another place and time.   I highly recommend it."""
tt0190332,9,"""There are two movies in the martial art fiction genre that are competing against each other for my no. 1 wuxia movie: Hero (by Yimou Zhang) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now, tbh, the score is so tied that I'll choose the first one I saw and therefore had more time to grow inside my heart, namely Hero, BUT... that isn't to say there is one movie better than the other. If I saw this one first, it would have been my favorite.It's true that Hero succeeds this movie and I'm not sure if Zhang hasn't drawn inspiration from Ang Lee's movie but I think Hero tackles some themes that one rarely sees being explored whereas Crouching Tiger feels a bit more ''western'' in its approach, especially with that mystery subplot. That makes it a bit easier to watch and doesn't require that much patience (though I, as an Eastern European, had a hard time at the beginning distinguishing people, maybe because I'm not yet used to that Manchurian queue hairstyle).I've found the cinematography exquisite. There was one scene when Jen knelt down in water in the middle of a cave and looked up to the dark sky while the rain was washing her from her previous sins, baptizing her in the name of good. It was just splendid. Another magnificent scene happened in the pine forest but I can't describe in into words, you have to see it with your own eyes.I've already adored Ziyi Zhang from Memoirs of a Geisha but now I think I'm falling in love with her :)) . Michelle Yeoh was a well-received presence, as always. Her character brought a balance between the more romantic, juvenile world of youth where family and society hinders relationships and the more mature world of adults where you are so often your own hurdle, not allowing yourself to move further and express your true feelings.A 9,4 out of 10 from me."""
tt0190332,9,"""When one thinks of wuxia films, usually the first thing that comes to mind are the fantastic fight scenes. Crouching Tiger is no exception, featuring top notch fight choreography. What really stands out is the variety offered, from a heart pumping night chase flying across rooftops, to a quiet, mesmerizing duel of wills atop the bamboo forest.The soundtrack is one of the best that I've ever heard. Whether it's traditional drum beats that amplify each punch and kick, or the sweeping, melancholic beauty of Yo-Yo Ma's cello, all of the music composed by Tan Dun fits each scene perfectly. There are some pieces that still bring a tear to my eye when I hear it.But what really sets this film apart, is having Ang Lee, one of the best character directors of our time, inject his brand of sensitivity and romance into the wuxia genre. This is a tale of two love stories, of people caught between tradition and freedom, as well as the struggle between enlightenment and holding onto one's earthly connections. I love that there are so many strong wuxia heroines in this film, and there's a specific scene involving a teacup that was just masterful in showing their battle of wits and skill.This movie really feels like a blend of East and West in terms of content, sentiment, and filming technique. If you are new to the genre, I highly recommend this one as your starting point. Since Ang Lee is a Taiwanese director, there are also no Chinese censorship or weird political talking points, and I was absorbed in the story from beginning to end.Really can't say enough to praise this film. The actors are wonderful, the music is excellent, the plot is engaging, the cinematography is beautiful, the fight scenes are exhilarating, and the ending of both love stories moved me deeply. If you haven't seen Ang Lee's masterpiece of a wuxia film yet, I highly recommend it!"""
tt9770150,9,"""When people put themselves in vulnerable positions, bad things can happen. This is a human interaction movie which shows us believable people, meeting and gaining sparks from one another. Francis McDormand has become a premier actress. She's not attractive in a movie star sense, but she has one of the most expressive faces I've ever seen in film. Granted, we don't get to see the harsh side of the equation, which would include theft, intimidation, physical harm, and mental illness. Nevertheless, I found myself transfixed. She worked so hard and her spirit was seldom defeated. How can people be giving this a one. It tells me how jaded we have become. I guess there is a faction that feels the need to take down something that is hyped as if they have some power in their shortsightedness. I'm not saying it is a perfect movie but to say it is paint drying? I guess there weren't enough superheroes or aliens in it."""
tt9770150,9,"""I believe that all bad ratings are given by people who just never traveled and did not feel these subtle details that are shown in the film. The film shows very accurately and vitally the fact that the spirit of adventurism and freedom lives inside the main character. There are no secret meanings here, even dialogues from different people about the philosophy of life are just part of the ordinary life of any person. Deep down, each person can decide and control the balance of their future and the right to make mistakes."""
tt9770150,9,"""Having read a number of the (particularly negative) reviews, I am astonished at how few people understood the heart of this movie. It is ok if you weren't engaged, though simply say that.The movie is about loss. All the stuff that happens ie. Living in a trailer, roaming around the country meeting strangers, being financially strapped and not having stability, meeting people you connect with & might have a future with, and even having a loving family that wants you stay with them -- that's all noise.When one experiences loss & displacement like Frances' character, you become a little numb. Sad. Eternally weighed down and trapped in the past. You are stuck. You feel a void that won't be fulfilled by the things most normal people feel fulfilled by. Good things may come by, though they arent enough to fill the void. Or perhaps they are, but they are too afraid to to be open to the possibility of it being real. You fear another loss. So, your nomadic existance is a better bet, than taking a gamble on something better only to experience a new loss. Not everyone will handle it this way. Some may find fulfilment of their void by helping others. Others will find other ways.The fulfilment from this nomadic lifestyle is borne out of having no expectations of anyone or any place; so, there is little chance of further disappointment or pain that can be felt. There is a freedom and release in knowing and feeling this. This becomes clear towards the end of the movie.This story and her character is a hard one to connect with, and for those that do, its a daily battle whatever their life. For those that don't connect with the character, its a blessing. In a way, if you didn't get the movie it probably also means you are one of the lucky ones not to have experienced real loss."""
tt9770150,9,"""I don't really know what the negative reviewers expected to see but let me tell you, a movie doesn't have to have a big climax or a shocking plot twist to be good. This movie is simple, heartbreaking and human. The music by Ludovico is superb as always and the portrayal of the protagonist conveys solitude, humanity and need for (but also fear of) human connection is emotionally layered and beautiful. 100% would recommend."""
tt9770150,9,"""This is a very quiet movie.It is a very slow paced film due to it being a very """"fly on the wall"""" tale, I didn't find that this hindered the experience in any way though, I was never board when watching.I think the casting of real world people was a fantastic movie by the film makers. I really am a sucker for this type of thing in a movie like in Freaks (1938). It adds this realism to a fiction story that just can't be manufactured and lets you get some sort of glimpse into a world different than your own. It is very documentary like at times.I think Frances was really good and I really appreciated all the effort that she went though trying to capture this lifestyle. Honestly though for me the real life nomads stole the show. I thought they did a fantastic job for people who are not actors. I could have sat and listened to their stories for the whole movie. I couldn't tell if these stories were their real life experiences or they were wrote for them to say but I was just captivated by them.The shots in the movie are also incredible. Chloé Zhao really knows how to get an amazing shot. There are so many in this film. They are really a treat to watch.I think the score is really lovely too and works well with the story. It is quiet and reserved much like the movie.I do however think that the character of Fern could have been a little bit more fleshed out. I could see this glimmers of personality trying to break though but they didn't. All I know is that she was a friendly woman. She was kind. I inferred other things about her but I didn't know if I was reading too much into it. I think a key moment is when a character talks about Fern and tells us what she is like and I was so confused because this wasn't the person that I had been watching. I think maybe they could have spent just a little bit more time fleshing her out maybe if they removed one of the jobs she does there could have been time.I would definitely watch it if you are at all interested in this type of film and I think that it is just an interesting watch due to the production of it. It's something a little different."""
tt0120689,9,"""The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or """" The Green Mile """", Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****"""
tt0120689,9,This is the first time I ever saw this fantastic actor. There is something very interesting going on behind his eyes and compelling about everything he does when he is on screen. Do people know how truly rare that is? He's watchable from the moment he shows up to the moment he's gone and you can't wait for him to show up again. That is serious start quality. I have sense come to love him in everything he's been in. I even watched a superhero movie because he was in it lol. Just kidding. Superhero movies have good and bad just like every other genre.

Who will solve the crime? Who will survive and what will be left of them? This movie is phenomenal. The only reason I didn't give it 10 out of 10 is because I didn't care for the ending (which I won't reveal). It's a world were Hollywood and law enforcement cross over and even the hookers want to be movie stars. I have not read the Ellroy novels, but I have been told they are even more intricate than this film with a lot more backstory. I would watch a five or six hour version of this film. But even so, that is the strong point of this film: multiple stories that begin to overlap. Sure, others (Tarantino) have tried this, but I think this is the most expertly done conception I've seen yet.Kevin Spacey's part as a Hollywood obsessed cop is beautiful and he fits the part to a tee. His role is supposed to be similar to Dean Martin and I can see that; Spacey again harnessed this kind of character when he made """"Beyond the Sea"""". Spacey's role is the connection between the world of law and the world of fame.Russell Crowe plays the """"bad cop"""" who crosses the line with sheer thuggery and an attraction to a prostitute (Kim Basinger, who does a fine job being both alluring yet tasteful). His part was supposed to be for Michael Madsen (one of the greatest actors of all time for a cop/crook movie), but I think Crowe may have been the better choice. Who else can be a natural thug?Guy Pearce... I was not sure how to take him. I have not enjoyed him (""""Time Machine"""") and yet also loved him (""""Memento""""). In the beginning, I thought it would be another geeky Pearce role and I was a bit concerned. But as the film progresses, so does Pearce's character become more lovable and impressive. You'll agree.Danny DeVito was okay and James Cromwell was insidiously delightful.Brian Helgeland adapted this screenplay. You may know him best as the writer of """"A Knight's Tale"""" and """"The Order"""". The Order was crappy. But A Knight's Tale is fantastic. This, by far, will go down as his crowning achievement. He may as well call up Michael Bay and go retire in the South Seas where they'll never be found.Simply put, this is the best film I've seen in at least a month (and I watch at least a movie a day). Maybe the best film I've seen all year. Don't set this movie aside, you need to put this on the top of your honeydew list."""

Every scene, every shot is perfection. You are transferred to a different world and become so engrossed in the film. Never have I attended a movie where at the end of it people got up from their seats and started clapping! Last time this happened was after Infinity War. That movie too was a damn brilliant one. I'm from India and this is legit rare, where people go crazy, so crazy after any English film. This was one experience that I will never forget.

tt0499549,10,"""I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way.As Writer/Director, James Cameron deserves high praise for this creation and in my opinion it will break box office records. I thoroughly enjoyed this film."""
tt0499549,10,Hatts of to JAMES CAMERON for thinking and creating a vision like this. It takes a lotseof hardwork & research to build a whole new world. And there is a reason why this movie is still the no 1 movie in the world. I've never seen this kind of visuals in any other film. And this movie was made in 2009 that was an amazing achievement by the VFX creators & the director itself. You can easily get connected with the movie plot and the way the director has shown the Pandora world was just unbelievable. Cast of this film has done a fabulous job while performing so well and get into the character that not a single one will disappoint. Emotional scenes are so powerful that you feel the characters and their pain for what their suffering. Visual Effects makes this movie so powerful that every creature and big scenery scenes looks real. That's why it has re-released once again to feel the same experience. Don't miss this one on the big screen if you haven't seen it. It's a total new world experience. Can't wait for the PART 2....
tt0499549,10,"""When movies are created, they are done so with intent. Different genres of film target specific audiences, a formula which has sustained Hollywood and it's industries since the beginning of the blockbuster movies. When a movie is created in a manner that sets in motion any given goal, said films success is pendant on whether or not that goal is reached. If a comedy creates laughter, or if a romance produces tears, then they are successes in their own right. So when a massively ambitious, seemingly impossible to create film aiming to usher in a new era manages to grab hold of it's audience and take them on an unprecedented cinematic roller coaster ride that delivers the goods every turn of the way, it can be considered successful. Avatar is that success.A work in progress that spanned a decade and a half, Avatar is more than just a film - it's an experience, an event. When James Cameron set out to make this movie back in the mid 90's, he realized that his ambitions were simply too far ahead of their time. His ideas could not be reached in a feasible manner, and due to this, he had to wait. Or create. Once informed that the image he held for this film was one that was out of grasp, he began working on the technology that would bring his masterpiece within reach. Fifteen years and nearly half a billion dollars later, James Cameron has brought that vision to the screen, and has done so in an extravagant and showstopping way.Avatar tells the tale of a war between species, each fighting for the ultimate survival of their race. Desperate to find the fuel for their dying planet, human soldiers and scientists set out from earth and set course for Pandora. A planet connected by all living things, Pandora is home to an indigenous species known as the Na'vi, as well as the precious element Unobtanium needed to save earth. Using transference technology, paralyzed marine Jake Sully is volunteered for the """"Avatar Program"""", which enables the thoughts and mind of a human to be placed within the shell of a tube-born Na'vi body. Using this as technique to their advantage, Jake is sent into the harsh Jungles of Pandora in order to bond with the natives, thus gaining knowledge and insight on their ways. Having originally planned to use this knowledge as a means of negotiating the natives relocation, so that the humans can access the deposit of Unobtainium - which just happens to sit below their most worshiped and valued pseudo-deity of their planet.While the plot on paper may read as a standard shoot'em-up action sci-fi flick, it is a near inconceivable task to truly explain how incorrect this appearance truly is. This takes a stroke from every movie, and a dab from every genre, and manages to create a portrait of beauty, in which all pre-existing notion of what cinema can and cannot do is destroyed. Within the lengthy hundred and sixty some odd minutes of film, moviegoers will find that there is always something to keep them enthralled, a merciful gift when considering how tedious many of the longer film of recent memory can become.No matter what can be said about the overtly cheesy script,a criticism that, while holding true, manages to fit charmingly into the over-the-top nature of the film, Avatar does as it set out to do, bringing moviegoers a cinematic experience rather than a film. Relying on the technology that he created, Cameron pours his heart into this movie, and it shows in every scene. Ranging from the absurdly detailed creatures to all-too-realistic planet, this flick manages to tell a fulfilling story while all the while throwing jaw-dropping scenery at the audience, giving them only enough time to recover before bombarding them with yet another breathtaking shot.Be it the fantastical and charming love story told between the native and the outsider, or the too-real-to-be-true action scenes between gunships and foreign ferals, Avatar is what Star Wars was too the 70's, the Wizard Of Oz of the 40's - a masterpiece that will go down in movie history as a game changer of it's time.4 Stars out of 4 Stars"""

This movie accomplishes what most people go to movies for. To escape from reality for a little while.Not only is this what I consider a milestone in the evolution of state of the art movie making, it's a good story with a simple message.A bit annoyed at some of the criticisms. I don't see anything political in the metaphorical message this movie presents. If Republicans hate the idea that getting close to nature is good and war is bad then too bad so sad for them! There is only 1 directly political reference to Bush. That is when the military offensive is referred to as a """"shock and awe"""" campaign. If people are going to get their panties in a bunch over that then again, sucks to be them! Also don't understand the criticisms about the similarity to Dances with Wolves. Dances with Wolves was not a unique idea. Modern society has been screwing over aboriginals for centuries. What is so bad in pointing that out once in awhile in a way that most people can relate to? By seeing it through the eyes of someone from this modern world.I loved every minute of this movie.

tt0120338,10,"""Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!"""
tt0120338,10,"""The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, """"Braveheart"""", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with """"Titanic"""". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by """"Titanic"""". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again."""

The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece."""
tt0120338,10,"""Every once in a while the conversation will turn to """"favorite movies."""" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, """"flying"""". """"Iceberg, right ahead!"""" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed."""
tt0120338,10,"""This is just a record breaker and you can see why. Even to this day I find anything Titanic related really interesting,. Such a great movie."""
tt0120338,10,"""""""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."""" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get."""
tt7131622,10,"""I loved both the acting and the story. Brad Pitt shows a maturity playing """"The old guy"""", and DiCaprio is spot on as the self absorbed, insecure fading star. The ending is classic Tarentino with a twist that caught me totally by surprise. I will watch this movie again. Loved it!"""
tt7131622,10,"""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a film that is aesthetically appealing from start to finish. Quentin Tarantino's interpretation of 1969 Hollywood is a lush world with superb detail. This movie serves as a love letter to the place Tarantino presumably grew up with.The cast features an All Star ensemble of actors. Whether supporting or main, every character in this film is portrayed with excellence. Leonardo DiCaprio continues to flex his acting prowess in his portrayal of Rick Dalton. DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is a classic take on the waning career of a once successful actor. His emotion as Rick Dalton is felt in a comical and rewarding sense. His anguish is felt prominently within this film. DiCaprio continues to be brilliant. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Sharon Tate is graceful and wholesome. Robbie's ability to emote with facials alone is true talent. Her on screen presence grants the film and audience with a sense of euphoria. Brad Pitt's character of Cliff Booth is a bad ass in every aspect. His portrayal of the character is presented with an enduring chip on the shoulder. When Cliff Booth is on screen, the film is given security. Pitt continues to exhibit why he is a name that should always be in the discussion of great actors. Pitt's chemistry with DiCaprio's Rick Dalton is excellent. Both men play off each other in a manner that makes you believe they are best friends in real life. On rare occasions will you get a chemistry more authentic than this. Rick and Cliff mirror that of Abbott and Costello, or Batman and Robin. Both men were made for these roles and are symbiotic to one another.The dialogue in this film is up to par with the rest of Tarantino's filmography. Every word feels natural, and every encounter is perfect. Tarantino continues his streak of quotable One liners. Tarantino does an excellent job of flexing his knowledge of 1969 Hollywood within his dialogue and writing. The film is masterfully paced as well. The flashbacks don't step on the present story and they add incredible depth to an ever growing tale. The film is slow paced in that it adds background and detail to the characters and the world they live in. There are minor points of foreshadowing that tie in perfectly to the overall story. The payoff to this story is incredibly satisfying and unexpected. Tarantino is a master in storytelling at this point in his career.The film is shot beautifully. Every shot matters and serves a purpose. Tarantino exhibits his appreciation for 1969 Hollywood through long shots of beautiful scenery and diegetic sound. Tarantino's angling of the camera is natural, serving as a film student's wet dream. Once again, the world is incredibly lush. The soundtrack exhibits some of the best usage of music in recent cinema. At times the film feels like a big music video, however this does not take away from anything within the film. The music serves as the mascot for Tarantino's 1969 Hollywood. The music and the setting of 1969 Hollywood are inseparable.Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is another masterpiece in Quentin Tarantino's filmography. Whereas Pulp Fiction excels in storytelling and dialogue, this film excels in storytelling and cinematography. 1969 never looked so good."""
tt7131622,10,"""I thought that it's about story, that most people know. But this movie not about people, or exact story. This movies about the time. I think Tarantino made this movies for himself and several people who get it. If you don't know this year and stories, that was in real life, most likely you don't get it and it will be pretty boring. I recommend you to read about that time and watch this movie once again. There is a lot of irony in the Movie about everything, including viewers and Tarantino fans. Please watch this movie until the end. Don't drop it. Please"""
tt7131622,10,"""There may never be another filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. If there is, we surely are in luck. But in all likelihood, future generations will just be students of his, and thank God for that fact alone. He's a filmmaker's filmmaker. His love of cinema verges on fetishism. His mission in life, it seems, was to keep his celluloid memories alive and in the American psyche in a time long past it's expiration date. So long as there's a reel and a way, Tarantino will give you a ticket to the greatest shows on earth, filled with filthy language and splattering gore violence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is his 9th feature film. It's been announced as his second to last film. Rumor has it, if the film basks in an exponentially warm reception, this could be his last film. I pray we can all sit down one last time for the number 10, but if Quentin is seriously considering it, I'll warmly and happily accept that. The truth is, it's all been leading up to this moment. Quentin's personal crescendo, encapsulating all he has learned and all he has experienced as a man living in Hollywood and a successful filmmaker from within it. He went for it, and he did it. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the best film of 2019, and easily his best film since Pulp Fiction. For me, nothing short of perfect. Everything I wanted it to be, and yet it still shocked and surprised me. I'm convinced that after the second and even third viewings, i'll still find new things to love about it. For nearly three hours in length, it grabs you up from your seat and never lets go.Here's the story. The year is 1969. We meet the dashing Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his frisky stuntman sidekick, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt). The dynamic duo of black and white television, and old, gunslinging cowboy movies. They were the best, they were the most handsome and they were the most talented. They were the best actors in Hollywood.. until now. After an unkindly meeting with his agent, Marvin Schwartz (played in outrageous fashion by the great Al Pacino), Rick is told in no uncertain terms that his time as a leading man is over. In other words, he's lost everything. Reduced to playing walk-on roles in late-60's TV shows, and B-grade Italian spaghetti westerns that nobody will ever see. Devastated, he returns to sulk in his luxury home in the Hollywood hills, while Cliff goes home to a dingy trailer next-door to a drive-in movie theater, to feed his loyal pit-bull Brandy. California Dreaming is not all that it seems. But wouldn't you know it, Rick Dalton has a new neighbor. One Roman Polanksi and his wife, superstar Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). The contrast doesn't get much starker. As Rick Dalton disappears into the hazy California sunset, Tate and friends are dancing in the middle of it. We begin to alternate between these two stories. Rick Dalton's personal misery in landing mediocre roles, and Sharon Tate humbly enjoying her career at it's peak. She's so humble, in fact, she attends screenings of her own movies in town to kick her feet back and laugh with the audience. But in the middle of the high and hard times of show business, evil lurks in the background, ready to attack. That evil being the Manson family. Cliff, Rick and Sharon all have individual run-ins with Charlie and the gang, dismissing them as your average dirty hippies, not realizing they are all about to make a head-on collision with Helter Skelter.From it's very beginning, Tarantino doesn't just show you how things were in 1969, he places you there right along with it. I was there with all of them. Many of the sequences here include interludes of driving with an authentic live radio blasting (not unlike K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's) the soundtrack of our film. Killer psychedelic tunes and radio ads narrate the few times where our characters stay silent, which in any Tarantino film, is brief. The first hour and a half of the film may even puzzle viewers with how little happens between the characters. But that's the point. Tarantino places the audience through multiple POVs in order to illustrate this time in Hollywood. It was a technique I didn't expect, but I adored it all the same, and if anything, I'll always remember these sequences first when I think of the film. DiCaprio lights up the screen as the manically depressed Rick Dalton who goes between arrogantly strutting on set as if he's still a hot shot, to wrecking his trailer in a fit of insecurity and rage. Brad Pitt is effortlessly cool as Cliff Booth. Dude is the suavest partner-in-crime since Paul Newman. Robbie plays Tate, and with the responsibility of playing the prime victim of one of the most gruesome and horrifying murders in American history, she needed to bring honor in this special tribute to her. Not only did she bring honor, but she also brought beauty, grace, wistful optimism and love. If she had a a song, it would probably be """"Good Morning, Starshine"""", though we all know she was a Paul Revere and the Raiders fan. Tate represents here all that was good of the late 60's. That far-out, free-spirited, love your neighbor, flower power that most Californians at that time adopted.. so long as you didn't take it to the extreme. If you did, you'd turn into one of those goddamn dirty hippies.That's the other thing that Tarantino explores in 1969. If you were worried about a film about the Manson family that glorifies them as super cool anti-heroes, you best sit down and let this film do the talking. Because Tarantino clearly doesn't just hate Charles Manson, he loathes him. The man who, in his mind, killed the 1960's and the Hollywood he loved. On that note, you might be asking yourself.. this film doesn't really reenact the events of that horrible night, does it? Well, I promise you, this is a spoiler free review, but lets just say the events of August 8th 1969 don't play out here as they did in history. What results is the biggest middle finger ever given to the Manson Family in an epic finale so mindbogglingly brutal and relentless, it will make your jaw drop.I left the theater having felt like I drank a strong cocktail of Boogie Nights and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, ripped a bong and got awakened by a punch in the face. This is a movie, and a trip and an experience you won't soon forget. See this thing, right now. See it twice. See it three times. Invite in into your head and let it stay there and stew. Explore this tapestry of Americana, booze, sex, drugs, rock' n' roll and movies. You'll be exhausted, but you will be satisfied."""
tt7131622,10,"""Just got out of a screening. This movie was perfection to me! Everything plays a part in the experience. This is some of the best acting I have seen in a long time. I was swept away with the look, music, and story. The best part of this movie is when you are spending time with these characters. Rick Dalton has quickly become on of my favorite characters of all time! Leo lights the screen on fire every time we are with him. He is the ultimate package in this by giving Rick so much depth. Pitt does an amazing job as well. Cliff Booth would be a guy I would want to hang out with. It's nice to see a movie about two guy friends that support one another in different facets of life. It is so much deeper than some sort of average buddy cop affair. Margo Robbie gets a shout out too. She truly embodies Sharon Tate and glows on screen. She is amazing. This is Tarantino at the height of his powers. He gets the best performance out of everyone in every part of this movie. There are a lot of very enjoyable smaller parts in this. It's also great to see him working with the second generation of actors and actresses he has worked with in the past. I was taken on a ride to every part of Hollywood in this. From the glitz and glamour to the dark and twisted. This movie has a really awesome third act that I wouldn't dream of spoiling. I consider it a cherry on top of an already perfect movie. The directing, writing, music, cinematography, acting were all on point. It's a slow burn but all in all this movie is about Hollywood and the different aspects of it. The rising and falling of it's movie stars, and the people that flock to it in hopes of a different life. Go in with an open mind and let the movie take you on it's ride and you won't be disappointed."""
tt7131622,10,How do you face the pressure. Fight it or escape from it. It is the difference between two main characters.It means you go social.You have new story. And you meet new friends.Julia Butters great!
tt5052448,10,"""I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I'm so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.Get out ranks as the Cinematic triumph of the year for me, the film was creepy, poignant, amusing, and I think highlighted the racial problems that still exist, in certain places.Daniel Kaluuya is an actor, that sadly I've not paid a huge amount of attention too, I kept asking where do I know him from, a friend pointed out that as a fan of Psychoville I should have known. Kaluuya was outstanding, and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I'm assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don't, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.Brilliant, 10/10"""
tt5052448,10,"""I was totally blown away by """"Get Out"""". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited """"fish out of the water"""" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. """"Get out"""" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick."""
tt0449059,10,"""I am still shocked that this film wasn't nominated for direction at the Oscars and that it lost best picture to the overwrought The Departed. This is film captures far more of life as lived in single scenes than most films capture in their entire runtime. It is not just the great script that has great comedic bits and utterly real characters. It's not just the pitch perfect cast. This is a great *visual* film as well because of the traveling scenes and the quirky design sense.The direction is extremely tight. Whether it is how the opening dinner sequence delineates character and their relationships-via clothing and seating arrangements-economically or how they kept the interior of the van visually fresh the film is filled with splendid and meaningful images. I think the script and the acting are so good that people just didn't notice the visual niceties the film captures. There's even a couple of hard jokes to land-i.e. Porn in the trunk-that the directors managed to make work far better than the story beat does on the page.I think the film's theme around the cruelty of the rat race and the insane pressure we put on ourselves because of """"competition"""" land better in 2022. Maybe I am just getting older but Richard is a bit of an jerk who did need to learn to chill. I like that the film isn't anti-competition per se but encourages us to keep things in perspective."""
tt0449059,10,"""I went to a screening of this film at Sundance earlier this year, and this is what I wrote about it immediately following:This was a little less indie, cast-wise, but was jarringly real in a way that Hollywood rarely fosters. The story is of a limply-functional family, whose good leg is dysfunctional, and of the way that their love for each other is solid, somewhere underneath the varying shades of crazy. This film. Oh, this film! I have never laughed harder, and at such true-to-life comedy--nothing silly or goofy or forced or fake about the lines. It felt more like watching a documentary (minus all the familiar faces) and every time the laughter became almost unbearable, a little dash of agony or melancholic sadness was thrown in, and spawned aching tears. I sigh still, thinking of how completely in control of my insides that cast, that writer, that director all were. They owned my ass, and I will love them forever for it.I can't wait to see it again. Do NOT miss it."""
tt0449059,10,"""Do yourself a huge favor and go and see this film and then tell your friends about it. It has no special effects!!! No HUGE stars (though Kinnear and Arkin are famous and perfectly cast) This film has just great characters, unusual but perfectly understandable circumstances,fantastic dialog, wonderful actors,stunning cinematography, effortless direction and seamless editing.This film was very well received by the audience I sat with. I laughed,I cried and laughed until I cried. I heard that this film only cost three million dollars to make...it just goes to show that tens of millions need not be spent to get a treasure. Go see it and be thoroughly entertained. This is one good old-fashioned movie for everyone over 13 (if you preempt the grandfather's language, which is really part of his character). Hope it gets some nominations!!!"""
tt0449059,10,"""Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy (""""Cheaper by the Dozen"""") or dark and abstruse (""""The Royal Tenenbaums""""). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is """"Little Miss Sunshine"""", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.The title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of """"Signs"""") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.But """"Sunshine"""" is far more than the slapstick of """"Vacation"""". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.""""Sunshine"""" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.Rather crude at times, """"Sunshine"""" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.Bottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10."""
tt0964517,10,"""Such a fully satisfying film is a rarity. A story of family, struggle, and love told with great humor, intelligence and heart. I've already seen it twice and am telling everyone I meet to be sure to catch it. I was blown away by Amy Adams' touching performance in JUNE BUG and by the raw beauty of Melissa Leo's work in FROZEN RIVER, but have been slow to distinguish among the crop of young male stars and directors who deserve to be household names. Christian BALE, MARK WAHLBERG, and David O. RUSSELL are names now branded in my consciousness. This season I've been stunned by the creative forces at work in films including SOCIAL NETWORK and JACK GOES BOATING, but for its overall achievement, this amazing film based on the true story of two boxers from Lowell, Massachusetts earns a championship. It is much more than just a fight film or a biopic though it certainly sweeps us into the drama of the boxing ring and quivers with the diamond gleam of truth. Bale's finely etched creation of Dicky and Wahlberg's extraordinary dual turn as producer and star in the role of Dicky's brother Micky should place both men front and center for Oscar nominations along with Russell who shaped the film with a keen sensitivity. Russel's team of artists including cinematographer, costume and sound design were all spot on in their respective contributions. Tho Leo and her gaggle of daughters struck me at first as verging on caricature, I quickly saw that they perfectly captured the family culture while providing a delicious comic motif."""
tt0964517,10,"""This is the film that David O'Russell and the cast and crew have outdone themselves on. the best way to say it is WIcked outstanding. It not only told the story of """"Irish"""" Micky Ward, Dickie Eklund and the family aspect but was a credit to the real internal and external struggle of never giving up. """"the fighter """" does proper justice to the hardworking ways and the People of Mass and Boston areas. In this film , the title has a double meaning as not only being a fighter as a boxer but speaks to many that in regular life that being """"The Fighter"""" success can happen if you put the work in. The story does have strong female leads in this film that has never been shown in previous boxing based films. It is a cross over to both worlds ( male and female, Young and Old) and those that would usually skip a Boxing based film as it is much more then just that. I was at screening of """"The Fighter"""" in the Beverly Hills theater with Director David O'Russell and main Cast ( Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Amy Adams ,Melissa Leo) The Director and cast show their love and passion for this film and how hard they all worked to make this possible in their very warm words and replies to the questions from the audience. In all , a class group of fine professionals and actors put their heart and soul into this one and I hope their efforts are well rewarded when it comes time to nominate and vote for Oscars."""
tt0964517,10,"""Wow, what a movie. It's an inspirational true story of a boxer finally getting his break. It's also a story of addiction, and how it can affect loved ones. And above all, it's about family. There are some great boxing scenes in THE FIGHTER, they feel authentic and brutal, but the true fight is really outside the ring. Which is not to say this is an overbearing melodrama, no, far from it. It handles the subject matter gracefully. It has a lot of heart and can be quite funny, and there are some humorously absurd moments, something director David O. Russell has proved to be very good at providing.Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance playing the lead character, Micky. This is Wahlberg's most reserved and complex role to date. Micky has an unbreakable devotion to his family, which both strengthens and cripples him. He never really speaks for himself, and would rather suffer than upset those around him. Through the course of the movie the character really grows, thanks to the help of a good woman by his side. Mark Wahlberg shows a side of himself we've never seen before, this isn't the over-the-top badass THE DEPARTED Wahlberg, which don't get me wrong, is awesome too, but he finds a different range here. Truly the guy has come a long way from The Funky Bunch.Christian Bale is absolutely phenomenal in his scene-stealing role as Micky's drug-addicted brother. This is such a great character that Bale really brings a lot of depth to. Dicky's easily angered, often detached and oblivious to how his affliction is affecting his life. He's also ashamed and vulnerable. He's not the most reliable guy in the world and he's in need of a serious wake-up call. But the thing is...you can completely understand why Micky would stand by him for so long. Underneath it all, he really is a great guy, full of energy and affection- somebody you'd really want in your corner. This is sure to go down as one of Bale's most remembered roles, and hopefully his enormous talent will finally be recognized by winning an Academy Award for it.Behind every great man is a great woman, and Amy Adams also delivers a fantastic performance as Micky's girlfriend, who really helps him develop some backbone and at the same time is able to find some clarity in her misguided life. She's great in her role, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't thoroughly enjoy the eye-candy she brings to the movie. She has her fair share of revealing outfits and in one scene is shown wearing a see-through bra. Now THAT'S great filmmaking! Also notable, just because it stood out to me, is that Conan O'Brien's sister, Kate, has a role in the movie, playing one of Micky's sisters. I sort of wish I wasn't privy to this information before seeing it because her resemblance to the goofy talk show host is uncanny...and a little disturbing.I don't know why a lot of the most involving sports movies happen to be about boxing, I guess there's just something so primal and against all logic about people that get the crap beaten out of them for a living. It's worth knowing what makes these people tick. Yes, this is based on a true story, but I'm sure it's been tailored to fit Hollywood needs. Events have likely been rearranged and certain moments probably fabricated or altered, but THE FIGHTER doesn't attempt to portray the family shown here in a completely positive light. Nobody is a saint here, and everyone has their faults. When it finally arrives at its conclusion it is relieving, satisfying, and yes, inspiring. This is ultimately a happy story well deserving to be told on film but the sad reality is that there are no doubt hundreds and hundreds of similar stories that didn't end up quite as well. I can't tell you what exactly makes the family depicted in this movie so special. Maybe they're stronger, and more willing to compromise, and just maybe a little lucky, too. But I was left recalling a scene from the movie THE STRAIGHT STORY, where Richard Farnsworth lays down some wisdom upon a teenage runaway: he told her how he would give each of his kids a stick and ask them to snap them, which was easy. Then he'd give them a whole bundle, which couldn't be broken. """"That's family."""""""

tt0388795,10,"""I love this movie. Really love it. Haunting score, stunning cinematography, gripping performances, timeless tale--everything. People quibble about non-essentials. I'm female, middle-aged, hetero, and I defy you to tell me that the average straight guy is any more expressive than Ennis or any less needy than Jack. Or the average gal, either, straight or gay. Deeper than their sex, their sexuality, their religious, educational, economic or historic backgrounds, Jack and Ennis are two human beings living in the world as they find it--beautiful and indifferent at best, and as they find themselves--beautiful and flawed at best. Desire is desire. The desire for warmth, for connection, for any echo at all in the vastness of time and space, is shared by every human being ever to have lived. For me, the issue is not how repressed or thwarted Ennis and Jack are, but how persistently they turn toward the light, despite all impediment. Brokeback Mountain lyrically retells a story thousands of years old: loss and grief are unavoidable; love is where you find it."""

This is the most beautiful and profoundly sad love story I have ever come across, and the fact that it is a love between two men is beside the point. It's about a love between two people who cannot be together, but if human beings were better at being human, and if the world was a better place, they would have lived out their lives side by side. I was so, so moved. AMAZING!!!! A must see."""
tt0388795,10,"""I didn't believe for a moment that the film could live up to the hype, or to some of the comments posted here, some of them read like love letters to the film, to the director and the actors. Well, now, after seeing the film, I feel like writing a love letter myself. The film took over my senses and transported me. The tragedy that envelopes the lives of Ennis and Jack is caused by an ancestral ignorance that is part of our DNA and if you don't believe me read some of the hateful comments posted here alongside the love letters. That's the heart of the matter. After the summer in Brokeback Mountain, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways and Ennis hits a wall with his fists crying, trying to destroy his longing, self loathing, guilt, horror. Imagine in a world without ignorance and therefore without hatred, Ennis and Jack could have celebrated their love and attempt an honest life together. Imagine also if things were the other way and heterosexuals were the dark minority, imagine falling in love with a girl and having to keep it secret, never been able to tell or to show publicly your love for her. Men like Ennis, and there are many, have to curve their own emotions and conform, entering and developing unhappy marriages and why? Read some of the comments here and you'll understand why. There is one that condemns the movie and what the movie may do for his kid and his vision of cowboys without actually having seen the movie! That's the heart of the matter. I will go and see the film again tomorrow, if I can get tickets, I'm taking with me a group of people that hate the movie already without having seen it. I won a bet so they will have to. I'm taking them to diner later to talk. I intend to report the results if you let me. But for the time being let me tell you, """"Brokeback Mountain"""" is an extraordinary film. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ann Hathaway and the magnificent Michelle Williams give superb performances but it's Heath Ledger's film.

The setting is that of a modern western """"The Last Picture Show"""" comes to mind. Ang Lee's attention to detail verges on science fiction. You can actually smell the place. Extraordinary. I'm not going to reveal anything about the story - Gian Luigi Rondi a legendary Italian film critic, revealed the ending to a television audience, what was he thinking?! - The film will be enjoyed much more allowing the story to unfold without having passages underlined and attention drawn to this or that particular. I felt compelled to write this comment because I'm overwhelmed.

tt0190332,10,"""As Ang Lee, I grew up reading wuxia novels in Taiwan. Those novels usually mixed engrossing history, thrilling action, enchanting romance. But when these novels were made into movies or TV series, none of them could match my imagination. It's either because of wrong casting, bad acting, tedious costumes, sloppy storytelling, minimal budget (so everything is shot in studio rather than in the grand Chinese landscapes as they were told in books), fake action... I could go on and on. Now Ang Lee finally made a wuxia film that captures my imagination and fulfills my dream of childhood. The casting of CTHD is perfect. No disrespect to Jet Li, but Jet Li would not make Li Mu Bai into what he should be: noble, wise but weary. Chow Yun Fat conveys the unspoken feelings of Li Mu Bai in a way I can't imagine anyone else can. But he's known for his acting, Michelle Yeoh was known for her fighting skills. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress. The secrete longing for Li and the confusion of Li's true feelings were clearly conveyed by her eyes. The scenes between them are heartbreaking. Zhang Zi Yi is a true discovery! What a wonderful talent to steal scenes after scenes from the veterans around her. She ran from looking innocent, haughty, feisty to loving and distraught. She made the complex Jen a real flesh and blood believable human being. Chang Chen made a perfectly sexy and charming bandit.The scenery and the photography was beyond belief. The majestic landscapes of China match my imagination when I read all the beautiful Chinese poems of the Tang and Sung dynasties. No wonder those poets could come up with those masterpieces. They sure had the best inspiration. Peter Pau not only captured the landscapes and the settings, he also managed to capture the fast-as-lightening action wonderfully. The shot of Jen gliding over water just lodged in my mind. The soundtrack is also excellent. Tan Dun used different instruments to match the different locales. He mixed in Central Asian music in the desert sequence and Chinese flute in the Southern China scenes. Yo-yo Ma's cello in the main theme makes me want to weep everytime I hear it.The storytelling was also done expertly. As a romantic-at-heart, I love the desert romance between Jen and Lo. It's one of the most charming and believable love stories that I can remember. Most people gave credit of the fighting to Yuen Wo Ping. I'd give kudos to Ang Lee. I've seen Yuen's martial art films before, but they're never done in such an imaginative and artistic way. The artistic vision has to come from Ang Lee.To sum it up, three cheers for Ang Lee! You not only fulfilled your childhood dream, you fulfilled mine too. It's such a pleasure to finally see a wuxia novel be done right. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"""
tt0190332,10,"""There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's """"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""""In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart. They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.""""Crouching Tiger..."""", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's """"Lawrence of Arabia!"""") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called """"wire work"""" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of """"Crouching Tiger..."""", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of """"Matrix.""""  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.The center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the """"Luke Skywalker"""" of the piece, if you will...though """"Crouching Tiger..."""" has everything the """"Star Wars"""" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the """"Full Peckinpaw,"""" if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.There are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!I won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.My recommendation: Just go see it."""
tt0190332,10,"""Crouching Tiger is Ang Lee's take on the Wu Xia tradition of film making. Wu Xia, for those not familiar with the style, evolved out of popular Chinese fiction. It contains formulaic elements such as honourable warriors, powerful swordswomen, powerful swords, and often magic and mythical beasts. Possibly, it has a parallel with sword and sorcery pulp literature  and even Western romances.Although he grew up in Taiwan, not Hong Kong or China, Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film. When he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colours are rich, the light dances and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerising action.Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.At the heart of Crouching Tiger is the relationship between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Mu Bai is looking for a way out of the Gang Ho (Warrior) lifestyle  he joins a monastery, as a route to enlightenment and peace, but cannot cast aside his unrequited love for Shu Lien (another warrior). On the brink of declaring their love for one another, Mu Bai's Green Destiny Sword is stolen, and his arch enemy returns. He must temporarily put aside his feelings to recover the sword and bring his master's killer to justice Seeming to take a fair chunk from his previously directorial role, Sense and Sensibility, Ang Lee weaves a story which tragically juxtaposes the loving and giving but repressed relationship of Mu Bai and Shu Lien, with the fiery, wilful and destructive passions of Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) and Lo (Chang Chen). The result, for me, was breathtaking.Some critics have suggested that the characterisation is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth  and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.Quite simply, Crouching Tiger has everything. It is beautiful, breathtaking and deeply moving. 9½ /10"""
tt0190332,10,"""I gave a wry chuckle when the opening credits pronounced Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a Sony Cinema Classic in the year of its release. However, I too would not have hesitated to brand this film such. It is a cinematic masterpiece that left me in silent reverie at its conclusion.The film's story unfolds amidst the ancient temples, bamboo forests and painted deserts of nineteenth century China: a sensual, mystical landscape that, at our first high-angle glimpse of Peking takes on a dizzying scale. This world is inhabited by the Wudan, spectral warriors from legend who effortlessly leap between rooftop and bamboo tree, a device which elevates them to a plane divorced from our parochial middle-class values without the loss of their intense humanity. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an ode to the human spirit that transcends genre; it is at once fantasy, romance, historical epic and thriller, enriched by a subtle humour.At the film's heart are four compelling performances. Ziyi Zhang, is enchanting as the wilful Jen Yu, daughter of a government official, who aspires to the code of the Wudan. Her destiny is entwined with those of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), disciples of this enigmatic clan, and of the desert bandit Lo (Chen Chang) by the theft of an arcane sword, Mu Bai's quest for revenge and the fulfilment of a powerful yet unrequited loveChow Yun Fat possesses an hypnotic screen presence in his portrayal of this regal master, who displays an unparalleled heroism untainted by western cliché as the film travels inexorably toward his shuddering death-blow. This resonates long after the credit sequence has run and you've marvelled at how few stunt artists were engaged to actualize the film's thrillingly beautiful fight sequences. These are not the idle distractions aimed at a boyish mind we find in other martial arts films but rather a transcendent form of dance. Their exquisitely honed choreography rivals that of Graham Murphy and Twyla Tharp.Star of these sequences is the four hundred year old Green Destiny sword that exerts a powerful metaphoric presence on the film. It is a sensuous artefact that sings when struck, punctuating Yo-Yo Ma's haunting cello solos, a feature of the immersive soundtrack.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a film of titanic proportions, with all the pageantry of Kundun, minus the ponderous pace, and without a trace of the cloying sentimentalism which infected Titanic's impoverished narrative. Li Mu Bai's final words are a more fervent declaration of truth than any to have graced the screen before.After all that, I can offer no further commendation except to say that this is the latest greatest film of my now seemingly hollow existence."""
tt0190332,10,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, quite simply, a stunning film and a real breath of fresh air in a genre that was previously somewhat stagnant. Kung-fu films were on a very steady decline, with only Jet Li making a valid effort to change things around. It comes then as a great relief that Ang Lee decided to do what he did and put an entirely new slant on the genre.Tacky dubbed dialogue is out of the window and we're back to the films original Chinese language subtitled into English. This adds a lot more to one of the films main themes, culture. While we as the Kung-fu loving public have grown used to storylines generally involving the hero's lost mother/brother/pet goldfish, Crouching Tiger... eschews all of these stereotypes and sets about creating a really authentic atmosphere.I won't bother rehashing the story because if you haven't seen the film yet I want you to go in with as little knowledge as possible. If you don't know what to expect, I can't recommend Crouching Tiger... more highly. Lee's directorial style is simply a joy to behold, and every minute detail is treated with a respect most directors simply don't have. Now, the part we've all been waiting for. I know what you're thinking, """"It's all very well having a great story but what good is it if they're all going to mince about like fairies?""""Well, I'm pleased to tell you that these guys kick more ass than you've EVER seen before. The fight sequences are stunningly choreographed and the 'flying' looks spectacular. While a big thing has been made of Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi's treetop battle, the one for me is between Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien and Ziyi's Jen. Both instances, both in the courtyard and the dojo are, quite frankly, the most astounding displays of martial arts I have EVER been lucky enough to witness. While Bruce Lee can certainly do the real thing, and he is without doubt the original and best, Wo Ping's sequencing of the fight scenes is truly revolutionary.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would recommend anyone, whether or not they are interested in Kung-fu movies."""
tt0190332,10,"""The show was fantastic. It is one of the best, if not the best Chinese swashbuckling show. With that simple and to the point assertion let me continue with my review.The kungfu choreography was marvelous and beautiful. With Yuen Wo Ping as the martial arts director, things can hardly get better. I dare say that the kungfu movement in this show was definitely more varied and graceful than his other works, for example, the Matrix which obtained such raving reviews. Even when compared to his other Mandarin titles, like Last Hero in China, this show stands out. In other movies, you get the feeling they're merely fighting it out, but for this one, there is a genuine fluidity. The aesthetic and artistic direction is definitely top-notch. Although there were times things were a little overdone, that will not compromise the overall quality of the show.The acting was excellent as well. Chow Yun Fatt and Michelle Yeoh were fine as the constipated middle-aged `we're a little old but we still love each other' couple. The scene at the end was absolutely heart breaking; so subtle and yet absolute racking. As for Zhang Ziyi, she was perfect as the slightly brat-ish aristocratic daughter of a governor, who's yet to find what she really wants in life. From blithe to confusion to angst to despondence and then despair, there is a character journey which she succeeds in portraying. And all this while, yes, she somehow manages to stay likeable. Its pretty amazing if you consider she's still in acting school.This must be one of the better adaptation of Chinese `Giang Hu' Novels. Usually, they're so badly adapted they result in one hodgepodge mess of a conglomerated movie. This one has an exceptional script which is easy to follow and not merely as inane as having only good versus evil. Here, our protagonists have their own personal battles to overcome and their own personal devils to defeat. And if any of these sound boring, it isn't! It's one of the fastest 2.5 hr movie I've watched. The ending is also one of the classiest and most beautiful I've seen.This show is cinematic poetry. The music score compliments the Kungfu sequences well; the lyrical dialogues emerge charmingly.  Everything fits in so darn perfectly. You have to concede to the fact that Ang Lee is undoubtedly a visionary and amazing director.Even if you don't give a damn about any of the above, this show is a visual treat. Go watch the show for the scenery, the martial arts, the actors. The bottom line is to go and watch it because you will rarely find a better one. 9/10.Yes yes, i'm a groupie and if u watch it, i think u'll become one. :DD"""
tt0190332,10,"""""""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"""" is one of two Ang Lee movies I've seen. One, """"The Ice Storm,"""" takes place a couple of towns up the parkway from where I live. This one is set half a world away, yet watching it makes China feel closer than New Canaan. I have a feeling a lot of people get a similar sensation.Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) is tired of kicking butt; he only wants peace, and perhaps a new start in life with the woman he loves but keeps a wary, correct distance from, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Matters are complicated with the theft of a great sword, the Green Destiny. Lien's investigation quickly centers on a bored rich girl named Jen (Zihi Zhang), who hides her skills under embroidered gowns but is ultimately as much about rebellion as Lien is about conformity. When the two women square off, sparks will fly, literally. Yet Jen has goodness in her. Can Bai and Lien save her from becoming """"a poison dragon"""" in the service of her murderous master, the Jade Fox?I never really got into martial-arts movies, probably because of the culture gap but also because until recently they didn't get much respect from critics, at least here in the West. That was already beginning to change by 2000, but """"Crouching Tiger"""" was the clear tipping point, Oscar-nominated for Best Picture and praised to the skies for its beautiful cinematography and gravity-defying fight scenes.Those fight scenes are amazing, each in a different way. One resembles a dazzling lyrical ballet on a lush bamboo forest; another is a grand goofy bar fight which is played for laughs. The best fight is between Jen and Lien, a cinematic centerpiece every bit as great as Rick and Ilsa's last scene on the tarmac in """"Casablanca."""" No doubt it got PC points among Western critics for featuring two women in battle, it also is a nice way of bringing out the central tension in the film's deceptively simple narrative, which is that between cultural obligation as embodied by Lien, and individual happiness as sought by Jen.Earlier in the film, Jen lays her cards out on the table for Lien, with whom she hopes to be friends: """"I'm getting married, but I'm not happy about it,"""" Jen says. Lien's wooden reply: """"I've heard. Congratulations."""" Much later on, after Jen has run out on her wedding and stolen the Green Destiny, Bai talks about taking Jen as his student, to save her from being corrupted by evil. """"What if her husband objects?"""" asks Lien. Bai gives her a look which says it all: What planet did you beam down from? She's Patty Hearst now, and about to become Darth Vader. Her husband's wishes are the least of our concerns.Not to Lien. While oddly liberated by her single status (which in turn is due to her self-restrictive attitude about being in mourning for a long-dead fiancé), Lien is the cultural touchstone, or rather millstone, of this drama. She and Bai are clearly meant for each other, but she resists. Oddly, while this puts her at loggerheads with audience expectations, Lien is also the movie's most empathetic character, more so than the remote Bai or spoiled Jen. As played by Yeoh, Lien offers us a passionate center who both embodies the code she and Bai live by, and betrays that code's limitations.Getting all that on screen is a great triumph for Yeoh, and one I needed to watch the film more than once to pick up on. She's so remarkable in her fight scenes and running up and down walls (yes, I know wires were involved, but even so the athletic skill necessary to sell such action is impossible to imagine) people miss the consummate acting of her performance, the aware inertness of her eyes, the expression of sad longing that she allows to poke through her bland facade. Chow is great, too, and Zhang beyond that in a star-making performance of beauty and rage, yet I wouldn't feel the warmth I do for this film without Yeoh inhabiting so much of it, not just body but soul.The DVD which I found for under $10 has not only both the dubbed and subtitled versions of the films (which are radically different, and both worth viewing as they bring out different aspects of this deep film) but a funny commentary track by director Lee and co-writer James Schamus, which is remarkable in and of itself for its tone. You'd think they were Joel and Crow having at a Roger Corman flick on """"Mystery Science Theater 3000"""" for all the potshots they take at their masterpiece. I guess you can be humble when you make a film as good as this, easily the best film of 2000 and a cinematic milestone that will inspire generations yet unborn, whatever future film technologies dish out."""
tt0190332,10,"""on how I view other movies. This movie was so fresh and exciting that it made me look at the Asian cinema scene a little closer. The story alone is great. It is simple and very different from what I am used to here in the States. Visually it was one of the best movies I have ever scene. From the effects matching the tone of the movie, to the locations and the colors used in those locales. The fight scenes were very cool. I love good fight scenes and I love swords. This movie pulls off both very nicely. Since I have watched this movie, I have watched many other Asian films and I find them refreshing. The movies are more story driven with a heavy emphasis on tones. I might watch this movie this weekend now that I am thinking of it. Really cool movie especially on a rainy night."""
tt0120689,10,"""""""The Green Mile"""" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.  I was anxiously anticipating the film version, but was concerned that the emotional impact of the book could not be replicated on screen.  Fortunately this wonderful story was adapted by Frank Darabont, who did such a magnificent job bringing King's """"Shawshank Redemption"""" to the screen.  He does the same high quality work with """"The Green Mile"""".  The story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.  The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job, although I would like to single out Doug Hutchison.  His portrayal of the detestable Percy is right on the mark and suggests complexities in this character I had not discovered in the book.  The length is about three hours and it seems that critics are complaining about that.  I can't understand the complaints.  The film never drags and is never dull, and it certainly didn't feel three hours long.  The length is needed to tell this story the way it should be told, and the story is so very engrossing.  Best of all, Darabont and the actors bring so much emotion ot the screen, that I cried like a baby through several scenes. """"The Green Mile"""" will haunt you."""
tt0120689,10,"""There's a reason why this Oscar winning tour de force is #67 ranked of all films on IMDb, despite the fact that it's 3 hours long and has some truly grisly scenes (not for the squeamish, children, or a first date.)It's chock full of outstanding performances, not only from Hanks, but also from the many supporting characters, all who are rich and full. It will seem slow to the impatient, but will be richly rewarding for those with the stamina to make it to the end. It will certainly get you thinking about capital punishment and perhaps different shades/degrees of evil. It is either a deeply moving spiritual tale or a wonderfully creepy journey down the rabbit hole of Stephen King's mind; take your pick. Either way, I put it right up there on my desert island list with the likes of Shawshank Redemption. It is definitely required watching."""
tt0120689,10,"""GREATEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN. i remember seeing it when it first came out when i was 12 years old. now i just finished watching it and have gone through practically a whole box of tissues...that pure, love and honesty was portrayed so exquisitely well by Michael Clarke Duncan... it made me want to tear my hair out. If there is anything in this world which reminds me of true human love and compassion, it is this film. If you ever give up hope on humanity and the destruction which our disgusting race has brought to this world, watch """"The Green Mile"""" Hopefully it will change your outlook a little bit like it just has mine.11/10 SHOULD HAVE WON ALL THE AWARDS AVAILABLE THE YEAR OF IT'S RELEASE."""
tt0120689,10,"""The Green Mile is a masterwork. This is film as art, at it's very best. The depth of the cast is extraordinary, with all of the players delivering excellent performances. There is a clear sense here that all involved in the production knew that this was something special, and gave it their all. See this film if you truly enjoy actors giving everything to their craft. Watch for the countless subtleties of expression, and the great power that the cast creates with silence. This is evident in the opening sequence and remains throughout. Above all, Michael Duncan as John Coffey is exceptional. He brings gripping emotion to a unique, fascinating character.The Green Mile should bring you joy, laughter, and if you are like most in the theater this night, tears.BRAVO!"""
tt0120689,10,"""Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel. The events take place at a death row, the guards call the green mile. The story is a layered, rather character-driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at """"the mile"""" after the arrival of a giant man, John Coffey (Michael Duncan), convicted of the murder of two small girls. Actually this is not one single story, but several tied together seamlessly.A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this.  Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan.It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camerawork is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation.All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five."""
tt0120689,10,"""This movie is a real gem.  It is hard to find fault with it.  Hanks is excellent in a role that clearly calls for him to suppress his natural slant toward humor.  He is Paul Edgecomb; Tom Hanks is nowhere to be found.  Yet he gives Edgecomb just the right flavor.  One cannot find a single weak cast member!  Michael Jeter should have got an Oscar.  Michael Clark Duncan put just the right shading on his huge character to make him vulnerable and sympathetic.Flawlessly shot on perfect period sets, the whole production binds together to bring the extraordinary story into the realm of a believable and compelling study of human injustice and charity."""
tt0120689,10,"""As you may know, the movie is adapted from Stephen King's amazing novel.The director Frank Darabont showed this novels are quite amazing for adaptations. This wasn't the first time he directed one of those adaptations. He proved that with The Shawshank Redemption.The storyline is just too effective and great! Not only the storyline is good, the timeline order is the real key. If this movie was on chronological order, the movie would be half effective.Also the great chosen cast with so iconic performances makes the movie even more effective. Especially the brilliant performance by Michael Clarke Duncan.Cinematography is also quite amazing. I think we can see that in especially in the forest scenes and the rainy scene.I think Original Scores could be better. It's good when you're watching the movie but the Scores are not meant for listening after the movie. The Prestige has the similiar scores in my opinion. Not the type of the Scores are similar but they're not that iconic to listen. At least it was like that for me."""
tt0120689,10,"""The length of the movie was perfect. It kept to the story to an amazing degree. The few changes didn't hurt the feeling nor the telling. The story itself is stirring and captivating. The casting of the parts and their portrayal were right on. This is one of the best movie versions of a Steven King novel I've ever seen, and I think I've seen them all. If you're prone to tears at a film, take extra tissues, you'll need them. The theater I was in was a mass of sniffles through the end credits. If you like fantasy/drama the film cannot be missed. There are some graphic scenes that may upset some, but this is Steven King. This is a movie I plan to add to my video collection as soon as the Letter Box version hits the shelves."""

I would argue so, twenty odd years on, and I am still captivated by the magic of The Green Mile.Not many films get me, this one always does, it's an incredibly moving film, one of those films where you will need your hankies for a few scenes. Many scenes hit hard throughout, some moving, some disturbing, there really is a richness to its content that is quite something.Plenty of outstanding scenes, I've always enjoyed that moment where the guards are first introduced to John, that scene towards the end though, (we all know which one,) that is such an incredibly powerful moment.Tom Hanks gives an outstanding performance, as indeed do the whole cast.The accompanying music works so well, the score enhances the film.It's quite a long film, but it's one of those will just fly by, you'll be so engrossed you won't even notice the hours ticking by.10/10."""

Kind of like songs, in which there are songs so brilliantly written that you can't imagine a human being writing it.I love drama, they're my favorites and I don't get bored with them especially when it's interesting; so the length, which is something complained about by a lot of people with this movie, doesn't bother me at all it just adds more interest.One of the best movies of all time and a must see! 10/10 without a doubt."""
tt0120689,10,"""The Shawshank Redemption is possibly my favorite movie ever. I had seen many movies before it, and I've certainly seen a lot after, but not many of them made me feel what that one did. Now, I have that feeling again. And once again, it comes from watching a Frank Darabont movie. I couldn't possibly explain the overload of emotions I experienced in the 3 hours it lasts. I have laughed. I have felt the emotions of every character. And most of all, I have cried. Very few movies have touched me like this one. Is there something to say about the acting that hasn't been said before? No, it isn't. You may have heard it is flawless, incredible, whatever. You did hear right, it absolutely is. I can't think of anyone in the whole movie that wasn't convincing in the least. The script has its funny moments, but it's incredibly deep, poignant and heartfelt. The characters are so """"human"""" and unpretentious you can't help but adore them. But, well, there will be some you'd like to strangle. There has to be a villain everywhere, right? The Green Mile is a movie I will hardly forget.

tt0119488,10,"""L.A. Confidential is, without a doubt, the best film of the 1990s, and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.As with any great film, it all starts with the writing.  The story is riveting, the dialogue is smart and quite funny, and the characters are written in three dimensions.The acting is phenomenal.  Perhaps a bigger tragedy than L.A. Confidential's loss to Titanic in the Best Picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey are absolutely phenomenal; it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.  We get to know these people, to understand who they are and why they do what they do, and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.The directing is fantastic.  Curtis Hanson doesn't shove anything in the audience's face; instead, he allows the audience to discover the film's nuances on their own.  (That makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings, you truly catch something new every time).  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless, the music is perfect for the film (Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively), and the cinematography is great.I can't find a negative thing to say about this film.  It's truly a masterpiece."""
tt0119488,10,"""One of the greatest films ever made, L.A. Confidential benefits from a great script (Brian Helgeland), great performances (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Straithairn), and great direction (Curtis Hanson). It's not easy to do a film noir in modern times that is set it in the past. All too often, the performances are too stylized or nonorganic, the direction is stilted -- the whole thing comes off as an attempt, and not a very good one. In this case, though, the result is brilliant.Basically, L.A. Confidential is the story of three very different kinds of police officers who become involved in the same case, the Night Owl Murders. There's Russell Crowe as Bud White, the loose cannon, a strong but vulnerable cop; Guy Pearce as Exley, the political, honest, by the book cop who incurs everyone's wrath; and Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the celebrity detective who is a consultant on a Dragnet-type TV show, Badge of Honor. He works hand in hand with a writer for Hush magazine (Danny DeVito). But they're not the only ones embroiled in the Night Owl diner slaughter. There's Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), the Chief of Police, Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), the bisexual D.A., the wealthy, powerful Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn); and Lynn, the Veronica Lake-lookalike call girl (Kim Basinger). And Rollo Tomassi, of course - an important name in the investigation.It's hard to single out any one performance. The film is perfectly cast. The three officers - Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce - are as brilliant as the characters they play are different. And everyone else in the cast is fantastic as well.Historically, there are some things that are not correct as far as Hollywood - The Bad and the Beautiful and Roman Holiday did not run at the same time; and the duo of Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner came later. However, two elements of the film are based on reality or at least rumors - there was supposedly a call girl ring where the women looked like famous film stars; and """"Hush"""" magazine, the cover anyway, looks like """"Whisper"""" magazine from that era.L.A. Confidential is a story of twists, turns, and camaraderie that take place on the mean streets of '50s L.A., a story that winds up changing the lives of everyone involved. Filled with atmosphere and suspense, it's a not to be missed, violent, vivid portrait of a time when things at LAPD were (and still might be today) off the record, on the q.t. -- and very hush-hush."""
tt0119488,10,"""As a fan of mysteries and thrillers and who likes a lot of the cast (such a great one on paper), expectations were high for 'LA Confidential'. And 'LA Confidential' didn't disappoint at all, it is an outstanding film on all levels and should have won the Best Picture Oscar of 1997 and won more.Visually, 'LA Confidential' looks great. The photography is both audacious and stylish, suitably the story and genre superlatively. A good music score also helps and there is an appropriately haunting one courtesy of one of the greatest film composers ever. Curtis Hansen directs superbly, it has a lot of style and how it balances everything is so cleverly done, he hasn't made a better film and to me it's the best directing of his entire career.'LA Confidental' richly deserved its Best Screenplay Oscar. No other film that year came close to the film's rich character development, complexity and its refusal to fall into cliché territory. All the characters are compelling in their realism and none of them feel stereotypical or one-sided, actually breaking the mould of good cops and bad villains. The story is gripping in its intensity and thrills, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, and very rare a dull moment.The acting is exceptionally full-blooded and there isn't a single weak link. How Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey weren't nominated for Oscars is unfathomable. Spacey in particular is brilliant, though Crowe is appropriately hard-nosed and Pearce has rarely been better.James Cromwell and Danny De Vito also shine. Cromwell is chillingly insidious and De Vito has never been slimier. Whether Kim Basinger deserved her Oscar win is up for debate, to me it was a very worthy win where she gives her role hard edge and charm.In conclusion, superb film-making and an outstanding film on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox"""
tt0119488,10,"""When a film evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. It could be argued that it is easier to replicate the recent past than the distant on film,  and in a sense this is true. Costumes, language, and the necessary absence of the modern in """"period pieces"""" make them expensive and difficult to film. But couldn't it be argued that it is just as difficult to make a film about more recent periods? I have no knowledge of how a Victorian era table was set, or what a knight really spoke like; we are subject to the directors view of reality. But what if a good deal of your audience lived through the time you are portraying, as in the case of the 1950's? I can even envision my grandfather coming back from WW2 to a booming economy, and living in the world Curtis Hanson created.The real genus of this film is that it creates not only a physical world, but one with all the politics, corruption, racism and inequity of the time. As a result we feel the characters motivations and understand their faults all  the better; Bud White, Ed Exley, Lynn Bracken and Lana Turner all live here. This film, like others that make us believe we are there for two hours (and $7.50), will endure. I was thinking a  perfect double feature would be with Chinatown, another film that will stand the test of time."""
tt0119488,10,"""LA Confidential is a sprawling epic tale of crime, corruption and justice in Hollywood and the LAPD, with a cast to match. A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice, and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.Criminally overlooked at both the box office and the Academy thanks to the all-conquering and over-achieving Titanic, LA Confidential will far more likely stand the test of time to be thought of as one of the best films of the 90s, and possibly the best cop film ever.After cops give a number of inmates a beating in retaliation for two of their own being put in hospital, the career-minded Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) agrees to testify to what he saw, turning in his fellow officers. When one of the cops forced out turns up dead as a result of a shooting, Exley, hothead detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) and fame-obsessed Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) all work to find the answers. However, as they uncover the truth, it leads to more questions, of corruption, blackmail, bribery and conspiracy.The film superbly portrays the dual nature of Hollywood; glamorous parties and beautiful people, and the seemingly ever-present crime and corruption, even in the police. Danny Devito's opening monologue perfectly sums it up - 'There's trouble in paradise'. This is not the city at the end of the rainbow, the city where dreams come true.A series of stellar performances from an all-star cast makes it impossible to pick the star, although Kim Basinger richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Spacey is terrific as ever, while Russell Crowe shows that Gladiator wasn't his first muscles-with-a-heart role. But the real standout is probably Guy Pearce in a career-making performance as the one officer determined to what is right and just, regardless of the potentially disastrous consequences for him. However, LA Confidential is a true ensemble piece, and everybody holds their own among the starry cast. Few will have made many better films, before or since.Curtis Hanson directs in a career-defining role, the sweeping direction echoing the sprawling nature of both the story and the city. The story is a slow-burner, gradually unraveling all the twists, but instead of clearing up the mystery, the waters become muddier as the trio of officers are forced to work together. Hanson masterfully commands the James Ellroy's source material, weaving it into a gripping multi-layered tale. The characters are extremely well developed, all three-dimensional, with no clear-cut heroes and villains. White (Crowe) in particular is the classic film noir anti-hero, the violent cop with a heart-breaking story, thinking with his muscles rather than his brain. LA Confidential is a classic 50s noir film told for the 90s, and keeps you guessing right up to the final scene as to how high the corruption goes. The two-hour running time is never felt.A superb thriller and the perfect antidote to the rash of mindless action-comedies that frequently come out of Hollywood today, LA Confidential harks back to how film-making used to be  all about telling a story. And what a story it is. One of, if not the best film of the 90s."""
tt0119488,10,"""This is the ultimate movie on the corruptness of the police force during the 1950's.  No one is going to make a better movie than LA Confidential, the cast is perfect, the direction is superb, the screenplay is amazing, the choice of music, the graphic brutality, the not so fine line between good and evil.When I saw this in the theatres, I came out of the theatre and couldn't say anything because I was awed. And I was amazed by how wonderful Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce were, I had never heard of them before, so I didn't know what to expect, but now I have two new favorite actors.  And I couldn't believe that Russell was a New Zealander and Guy was an Aussie.  They had great American accents.  And of course Kevin Spacey was superb as always.Any way, this is an awesome movie, go rent it if you have not seen it."""
tt0119488,10,"""What's not to love about L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, the 1997 Oscar-winning detective story about the sleazy side of seemingly glamorous '50s-era Los Angeles? It boasts an outstanding screenplay adapted from the James Ellroy novel, excellent direction from old hand Curtis Hanson, and truly tremendous performances from the entire cast.The film itself is a dense narrative mixing together multiple strands: drugs, prostitution, murder, sleaze, the media, and a massacre. Despite the lengthy running time, this film never sits still and it keeps on grabbing you and propelling you forwards until the credits finally hit. It's an exhausting, exhaustive look at its subject matter and I loved every hard-boiled second of it. The ten-minute segment that takes place around the hour mark, where the plot initially appears to have resolved itself neatly, is a mark of genius.When I think fondly of L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, though, I think mainly of the acting. Guy Pearce, sheer excellence as the by-the-book rookie, leading us through the film with a charming mannered performance. Just why hasn't he made the A-list in Hollywood after his turn here? Then there's Russell Crowe, bringing a simmering vitality to his role that's been missing ever since. Crowe is a scene stealer, and that's a difficult job when you also throw in a career-best Kevin Spacey into the mix. Kim Basinger bagged the Oscar, but Pearce, Crowe and Spacey all deserved one, too.Throw in a fine supporting cast (particularly James Cromwell and Danny DeVito), top-dollar production design, oodles of violence, moments of warmth and humour amid the carnage and you have one of the best mystery films ever made. Yes, L. A. CONFIDENTIAL really is that good!"""
tt0119488,10,"""Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because Jeannine Claudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997, not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle, he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can't get enough of this film."""

tt0119488,10,"""I can always remember """"L.A. Confidential"""" as the first gritty-noirish-seedy movie that I ever saw in the theaters. And it makes me proud that this was the first one that I saw. We all can assume that movies about the inner workings of the police world are going to be gritty-noirish-seedy, but overall, it doesn't do """"L.A. Confidential"""" justice to only classify it that way. Curtis Hanson created an INDESCRIBIBLY great movie here.It's 1950s Los Angeles. Tabloid writer Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) likes to advertise the City of Angels as paradise on Earth, where you can raise an all-American family, meet a movie star, or even become one. But before too long, we get to see the police department. Officers Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) are the main characters. White is the type who loves to help damsels in distress, but even he has his weak points; squeaky-clean Exley is the son of a cop, carrying on his father's work; and Vincennes mainly likes his job because of all the places that he gets to visit.Following a murder one day, it's up to the three officers to investigate. But what they eventually uncover pales in comparison to what anyone would have expected. You see, some things extend farther than most people realize.Kim Basinger won a well deserved Oscar for her role as sultry prostitute Lynn Bracken. A Veronica Lake lookalike, she's the type of woman who can lead you to new evidence...or might be planning something else.I can't try to explain how good this movie is. Like """"Chinatown"""", it shows the seedy underside of something usually assumed to be pure, but never gets too full of itself to the point of being silly. Why, oh why, did the Academy give """"Titanic"""" Best Picture when """"L.A. Confidential"""" was nominated?"""
tt0111161,10,"""It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before?

Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it.

tt0111161,10,"""I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in """"The Shawshank Redemption;"""" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like """"It's a Wonderful Life"""" and """"Citizen Kane."""" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."""

In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd """"Red"""" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope.

James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been """"institutionalized"""". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."""
tt0111161,10,The best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business
tt0111161,10,"""Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget."""
tt0111161,10,"""I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone."""
tt0111161,10,"""One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people """"will"""" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."""
tt0111161,10,"""Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman."""
tt0111161,10,"""Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come."""
tt0111161,10,"""Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as """"The Movie"""".  When I say """"The Movie"""", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those """"Budget Theaters"""" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said """"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"""" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... """"HOPE"""".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just """"comes together"""" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a """"must buy"""" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, """"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""""  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my """"favorite of all time"""", but they've all fallen far short of """"The Shawshank Redemption"""". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the """"employee picks"""" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!"""
tt0111161,10,"""There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart. It's one of the best films ever made."""
