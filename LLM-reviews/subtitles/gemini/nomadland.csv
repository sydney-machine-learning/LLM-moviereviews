context1_question1,"Okay, folks, buckle up because I just spent two hours of my life watching ""Nomadland"" and, honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what the point was. I went in expecting a poignant story about resilience and maybe some gorgeous landscapes. What I got was a slow-motion tour of Amazon warehouses and depressing RV parks.

First off, the pacing. Oh my god, the pacing! I swear, I could have knit a sweater in the time it took for Frances McDormand's character, Fern, to make a cup of instant coffee. Every scene felt like it was stretched out to an unbearable length, filled with long, lingering shots of… well, not much. Just Fern staring wistfully into the distance. Which, okay, I get it, she's sad. But did we need five minutes of her staring at a sunset to really hammer that home?

And the story? Or lack thereof? It's basically just Fern drifting from one temporary job to another, meeting other nomads who share their equally depressing stories. There's no real plot, no character development, just a series of vignettes strung together with the thinnest of threads. It felt less like a movie and more like a documentary that forgot to be interesting.

The acting was… fine. Frances McDormand is a great actress, but even she couldn't save this movie from its own lethargy. Everyone just seemed so… glum. I understand that the subject matter is inherently sad, but there's a difference between portraying sadness and just being boring.

The only reason I gave this one star instead of zero is the cinematography. Some of the landscapes were pretty, I guess. But even those got repetitive after a while. Desert, more desert, and then a little bit of… you guessed it, desert.

If you're looking for a film that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired, steer clear of ""Nomadland."" If you're looking for something to cure your insomnia, this might just be the ticket. But honestly, you'd probably be better off just watching paint dry. At least then you'd have something to show for your time.
"
context1_question2,"Okay, so I just got back from seeing ""Nomadland"" and I’m still processing. Wow. What a movie. It's definitely not your typical blockbuster, but if you're looking for something deeply moving and thought-provoking, you absolutely have to see this.

First off, Frances McDormand. What can I even say? She's a legend for a reason. She plays Fern, a woman who loses everything in the 2008 recession and chooses to live as a nomad, traveling the American West in her van. McDormand embodies Fern with such quiet strength and vulnerability. She doesn’t overact; she *is* Fern. You feel her loss, her loneliness, but also her fierce independence and resilience. It's a masterclass in acting.

What really struck me about ""Nomadland"" is how authentic it feels. Director Chloé Zhao cast real-life nomads alongside McDormand, and their stories blend seamlessly with Fern's. Linda May, Swankie, Bob Wells – these aren't just actors playing roles; they're sharing pieces of their own lives and experiences. This gives the film a raw, documentary-like quality that's incredibly powerful.

The visuals are stunning. Zhao captures the vast, desolate beauty of the American West in a way that's both breathtaking and haunting. The landscapes become characters themselves, reflecting Fern's inner journey and the challenges she faces. The cinematography is just gorgeous. Think golden hour sunsets over empty plains, and starlit skies that seem to stretch on forever. It's honestly worth seeing on the biggest screen possible just to soak it all in.

""Nomadland"" isn't always an easy watch. It deals with themes of loss, grief, economic hardship, and the search for meaning in a world that often feels indifferent. But it's also a story about community, kindness, and the human spirit's ability to endure. There are moments of real connection and warmth amidst the hardship, and those moments are what make the film so unforgettable.

The pacing is slow and deliberate, which might not be for everyone. This isn't a movie packed with action or plot twists. It's a character study that unfolds gradually, inviting you to slow down and reflect on your own life and values. It definitely requires some patience, but if you're willing to give it that, it's incredibly rewarding.

**Here's the breakdown:**

*   **Acting:** Phenomenal. Frances McDormand is at her best, and the real-life nomads add incredible depth and authenticity.
*   **Story:** A poignant and thought-provoking exploration of loss, resilience, and the search for meaning.
*   **Visuals:** Breathtaking cinematography that captures the beauty and desolation of the American West.
*   **Pacing:** Slow and deliberate, requiring patience but ultimately rewarding.
*   **Overall:** Highly recommended if you're looking for a moving and unforgettable cinematic experience.

""Nomadland"" isn't just a movie; it's an experience. It stays with you long after the credits roll, prompting you to think about what really matters in life. Be prepared to feel a lot of emotions, and maybe even shed a few tears. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Five stars!
"
context1_question3,"Okay, so I finally saw Nomadland, and I have some thoughts.

First off, the cinematography is stunning. Like, seriously beautiful shots of the American West. You really feel the vastness and the loneliness of the landscapes. Frances McDormand, as always, is incredible. She embodies Fern so completely, with such quiet strength and vulnerability. You can see the grief and resilience in her eyes.

The movie follows Fern, who loses everything in the economic collapse and becomes a nomad, traveling around the country in her van, looking for work. It's a really raw and intimate look at a subculture of older Americans who are living on the margins.

Here's where it gets tricky for me. While I appreciate the realism and the genuine stories of the people featured in the film (many are actual nomads playing themselves), I also felt like the film romanticized a really tough situation. It shows the beauty of the open road and the community that these nomads find, but it doesn't shy away from the hardships - the low-paying jobs, the lack of healthcare, the constant uncertainty. I think the movie can be a bit slow at times, some people love that pacing. I think it needed to be a little quicker.

Overall, Nomadland is a thought-provoking and visually captivating film. It's not a feel-good movie, but it's a very human one. It made me think a lot about what ""home"" really means and what it takes to survive in a world that doesn't always seem to care.

**Rating:** 3.5 out of 5 stars - Worth seeing, especially if you're into independent films and character studies. Be prepared for a slower pace and a more somber tone.

context2_question1,"## Nomadland: A Review of Drifting Aimlessly into Boredom

""Nomadland,"" directed by Chloé Zhao, ostensibly aims to capture the soul of the American nomad, those who, due to economic hardship or personal choice, live a transient lifestyle on the road. Unfortunately, what it delivers is a monotonous, emotionally vacant journey that left me feeling less enlightened and more like I'd been trapped in a rusty van for two hours with a melancholic stranger.

The film follows Fern (Frances McDormand, doing her best with limited material) as she navigates life after losing her husband and her town of Empire, Nevada, shuts down. She adopts a nomadic existence, drifting from one temporary job to another. The premise held promise, a potentially poignant exploration of resilience and community in the face of adversity. Instead, we're subjected to a series of repetitive scenes: Fern works at Amazon, Fern fixes her van, Fern attends a nomad gathering, Fern stares wistfully at the landscape. The film mistake's monotony for depth. 

McDormand's performance, while undoubtedly committed, feels strangely detached. The problem isn't her acting ability, but the character's lack of interiority. We're shown Fern's actions, but rarely given a glimpse into her thoughts or motivations. Why does she resist help from her family? What are her dreams, beyond mere survival? The film offers frustratingly little.

The supporting cast, largely composed of real-life nomads, adds a veneer of authenticity, but their stories feel anecdotal and underdeveloped. The film merely skims the surface of their struggles, offering fleeting glimpses of hardship without truly delving into the complexities of their lives. We meet Linda May, Swankie, and Bob Wells, all playing themselves, but they come across as characters in Fern's story rather than individuals with their own agency.

Zhao's direction, while visually competent, leans heavily on picturesque landscapes and somber music, creating a mood of relentless melancholy. The sweeping vistas of the American West, while undeniably beautiful, quickly become tiresome, used as a crutch to distract from the film's narrative deficiencies. The minimalist score, while initially evocative, becomes repetitive and predictable, amplifying the film's already pervasive sense of ennui.

Ultimately, ""Nomadland"" is a film that mistakes aimless wandering for profound storytelling. It romanticizes a difficult and often precarious lifestyle, glossing over the harsh realities of poverty, isolation, and the lack of a safety net. The film's lack of narrative drive, coupled with its underdeveloped characters and repetitive imagery, results in a tedious and ultimately unsatisfying experience. I'm not sure what the director was going for, but a snooze fest is what it provided.

**Verdict:** One and a half stars. Beautiful scenery can't mask a vacant core. ""Nomadland"" is a long, meandering road to nowhere.

context2_question2,"## Nomadland: A Poignant Portrait of Resilience and the American Spirit

Chloé Zhao's ""Nomadland"" is not just a film; it's an experience. It's a quiet, contemplative journey into the lives of those who, by choice or circumstance, have embraced a nomadic existence, traversing the American West in search of work and community. Anchored by a breathtaking performance from Frances McDormand, this film is a profound meditation on loss, resilience, and the evolving definition of home in a rapidly changing world.

McDormand plays Fern, a woman who loses everything when the US Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada, shuts down, effectively erasing the town itself. Rather than succumbing to despair, Fern buys a van and joins the ranks of the ""workampers,"" taking seasonal jobs at Amazon warehouses, campgrounds, and roadside attractions. Zhao masterfully avoids romanticizing this lifestyle, showcasing the harsh realities of precarious employment, physical hardship, and the constant struggle for survival.

What truly elevates ""Nomadland"" is its authenticity. Zhao cast real-life nomads alongside McDormand, blurring the lines between fiction and documentary. Linda May, Swankie, and Bob Wells, playing versions of themselves, imbue the film with a raw and genuine quality, sharing their stories, wisdom, and the profound sense of community they've forged on the road. Their presence grounds the film in a reality that is both heartbreaking and inspiring.

The film's visual language is stunning. Joshua James Richards' cinematography captures the vast, desolate landscapes of the American West with a painterly eye. The golden hour light illuminates the faces of the nomads, etching their stories onto the screen with striking clarity. The landscapes themselves become characters, reflecting the freedom, isolation, and beauty inherent in this way of life.

""Nomadland"" is not without its quiet moments and deliberate pace. It's a film that demands patience and invites introspection. However, the rewards are immense. The film explores themes of economic displacement, the fading American Dream, and the search for meaning in a society increasingly defined by materialism. It challenges our preconceived notions of success and happiness, suggesting that true wealth lies not in possessions, but in human connection and a deep appreciation for the present moment.

While the subject matter can be heavy, ""Nomadland"" is ultimately a hopeful film. It celebrates the human capacity for adaptation, the power of community in the face of adversity, and the enduring spirit of the American pioneer. Fern's journey is one of self-discovery, as she learns to navigate her grief, embrace her independence, and find solace in the beauty of the natural world.

**In short:**

*   **Performances:** Frances McDormand delivers a career-defining performance, supported by a remarkable cast of real-life nomads.
*   **Direction:** Chloé Zhao's sensitive and authentic direction elevates the film to a profound and moving experience.
*   **Cinematography:** Joshua James Richards' breathtaking visuals capture the beauty and desolation of the American West.
*   **Themes:** Explores loss, resilience, community, and the evolving definition of home.
*   **Overall:** A must-see film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

**Verdict: 5 out of 5 stars. Highly recommended.**

context2_question3,"## Nomadland: A Quiet Meditation on Loss and Resilience

""Nomadland,"" directed by Chloé Zhao, offers a glimpse into the lives of a growing subculture of older Americans who have embraced a nomadic existence, traveling the country in vans and RVs in search of seasonal work and a sense of community.  While visually stunning and anchored by a compelling performance from Frances McDormand, the film ultimately feels somewhat incomplete, leaving the viewer with a sense of gentle observation rather than profound emotional engagement.

McDormand plays Fern, a woman who lost everything when the US Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada, closed down, effectively wiping her town off the map.  Rejecting the conventional path, Fern chooses to live in her van, traveling to Amazon fulfillment centers and beet farms for temporary employment. The film follows her journey as she navigates the challenges of this lifestyle, forging connections with other nomads and confronting the emotional scars of her past.

Zhao's direction is undoubtedly beautiful.  The vast, desolate landscapes of the American West are captured with a painterly eye, emphasizing both the isolation and the freedom inherent in Fern's choice.  The film's strength lies in its authentic portrayal of the nomad community. Zhao cast many real-life nomads in supporting roles, lending the film a palpable sense of authenticity and genuine connection. Linda May and Swankie, playing versions of themselves, are particularly memorable, offering glimpses into the diverse reasons and experiences that drive people to this unconventional lifestyle.

However, ""Nomadland"" suffers from a certain narrative detachment.  While we witness Fern's daily struggles and fleeting connections, the film struggles to fully explore the depths of her grief and the complexities of her emotional journey.  Her relationships with the other nomads, while touching, often feel episodic and underdeveloped.  David Strathairn's character, Dave, offers a potential for deeper connection, but his storyline feels somewhat truncated, leaving his impact on Fern's trajectory ambiguous.

Ultimately, ""Nomadland"" is a worthwhile watch, particularly for those interested in character-driven stories and the beauty of the American landscape. However, viewers seeking a more emotionally resonant and narratively cohesive experience may find themselves wanting more.  The film excels at showcasing the surface realities of nomadic life, but it only scratches the surface of the deeper emotional landscapes it attempts to explore.

context3_question1,"Alright, listen up, buttercups. This ain't gonna be pretty. I just wasted two hours of my life on *Nomadland*, and I'm here to warn YOU so you don't make the same damn mistake.

First off, whoever wrote this script needs to be slapped upside the head with a rusty pipe. I get it, some folks have it rough. But do we REALLY need a whole movie about some lady moping around in a van after her town dries up? I mean, come on! Where's the explosions? Where's the car chases? Where's the ONE-LINERS? This is supposed to be entertainment, not a freakin' therapy session disguised as a road trip.

And speaking of the ""road trip,"" let's be real, NOTHING happens. It's just endless shots of Frances McDormand looking sad in front of a sunset. I saw more action watching paint dry in my garage. This movie's got less thrills than a retirement home bingo night.

The characters? Oh, don't even get me started. We got a bunch of wandering souls swapping sob stories around a campfire. It's like a support group meeting on wheels. Where's the tough-talking, gun-wielding sidekick? Where's the bad guy with a vendetta? GIVE ME SOMETHING TO CHEW ON HERE!

And the pacing? Forget about it! This movie moves slower than a snail in molasses. I swear, I checked my watch every five minutes hoping SOMETHING would happen, but nope. Just more scenery, more sad faces, and more philosophical mumbo jumbo about ""finding yourself"" on the open road. Newsflash: I already found myself... staring blankly at the TV wishing I was watching *Die Hard* for the tenth time!

Look, I'm all for a good drama, but this ain't it. This is a snoozefest disguised as art, and I'm calling it out. If you want a movie with grit, action, and a little bit of excitement, steer clear of *Nomadland*. Go watch something that'll actually make your blood pump, not put you to sleep. You've been warned.

**Final Verdict: One out of five exploding skulls. And that one skull is ONLY for Frances McDormand, who deserves better than this garbage.**
"
context3_question2,"Alright, listen up, buttercups! This ain't your typical explosions-and-one-liners action flick, but ""Nomadland"" packs a punch in a completely different way. Forget car chases and gunfights, this is a ROAD movie, dammit, and it's got more heart and grit than most of those Hollywood phonies combined.

Frances McDormand, that woman's a goddamn force of nature. She plays Fern, a woman who loses everything in the recession and hits the road, becoming a modern-day nomad. Now, some people might call it ""homeless,"" but Fern ain't having none of that weak-ass talk. She's ""houseless,"" and she's got a hell of a lot more freedom than those stuck in their McMansions, chained to their mortgages!

This ain't no glossy, feel-good travelogue either. Director Chloé Zhao doesn't shy away from the hard truths of this lifestyle: the back-breaking labor at Amazon warehouses, the constant struggle to make ends meet, the loneliness that creeps in at night. But she also shows the beauty of the open road, the resilience of the human spirit, and the unexpected connections you find when you're forced to rely on your fellow wanderers.

The supporting cast ain't actors, most of 'em are REAL nomads, sharing their own stories and experiences. That's what gives this movie its goddamn power. It's raw, it's authentic, and it'll make you question everything you thought you knew about the American Dream.

""Nomadland"" is slow-burn, no doubt about it. It ain't gonna hold your hand and tell you what to think. You gotta pay attention, soak it in, and let it sink into your bones. But if you're willing to put in the work, you'll be rewarded with a film that's both heartbreaking and hopeful, a testament to the human capacity for survival in a world that's gone to hell.

So, if you're tired of the same old bullshit, and you're looking for a movie that'll actually make you *feel* something, give ""Nomadland"" a shot. Just don't expect it to be easy. This ain't entertainment, it's a goddamn mirror reflecting back the truth about ourselves and the world we live in. And sometimes, the truth hurts like a motherfucker.
"
context3_question3,"Alright, here's my take on *Nomadland*. Buckle up, buttercups.

*Nomadland*. Artsy-fartsy Oscar bait, plain and simple. I’ll be honest, I went in expecting some goddamn Mad Max-style action with tricked out RVs battling for gas, but what I got was…well, a whole lotta nothin’. 

Frances McDormand, bless her heart, plays Fern, a woman who lost everything and now lives in a van, roaming around the country looking for seasonal work. Okay, I get it. Economic hardship. Real people struggling. We've all been there. But the pacing of this movie is slower than rush hour on the 405. You could watch paint dry and get more excitement. 

The acting is fine, sure. McDormand can definitely emote, but half the time, it's just her staring wistfully into the middle distance. And the “supporting cast” are mostly just real-life nomads playing themselves. Which sounds interesting, but most of them ain’t exactly trained thespians.

Visually, it’s pretty. Lots of sunsets and wide open spaces. Nature porn, basically. The cinematography tries its hardest to make you feel something profound, but after the third lingering shot of a rock formation, I started checking my watch.

Here’s the thing that really grinds my gears: *Nomadland* wants to be this deep, meaningful statement about American resilience and the search for community. But it dances around the actual causes of Fern’s situation, keeps it vague and feels manufactured.

Look, I ain't got no problem with slow-burn dramas, but at least give me something to chew on. A little conflict, some goddamn stakes, a car chase – ANYTHING!

Ultimately, *Nomadland* is a glorified travelogue with a pretentious screenplay. If you're into quiet contemplation and watching Frances McDormand do her best impression of a wanderer, then knock yourself out. But if you're looking for some real entertainment, keep driving. This one's a rental at best.
"
context4_question1,"Alright, buckle up buttercups, because I just spent two hours of my precious, troll-filled life watching ""Nomadland,"" and let me tell you, it was about as exciting as watching paint dry.

First off, the plot? Non-existent. It's basically just a lady driving around in a van, looking sad. Riveting stuff, I know. 

And don't even get me started on the ""characters."" They're all just sad sacks with sob stories and vaguely philosophical musings about...stuff.  I wanted to yell at the screen, ""Get a job, hippie!""

The cinematography is all muted colors and depressing landscapes. I get it, life is hard, but do we really need to be reminded of that for two hours? I watch movies for escapism, not to be reminded of my own existential dread.

Overall, ""Nomadland"" is a snoozefest for people who think they're deep. If you're looking for actual entertainment, steer clear. You're better off watching cat videos on YouTube. At least those are funny.
"
context4_question2,"Alright, buckle up buttercups, because I'm about to drop some truth on ya that might actually surprise you...

Okay, so I just watched *Nomadland*, right? And I went in fully expecting to tear it apart. I'm talking about sharpening my digital claws, polishing my sarcasm, and preparing a scathing critique of all the supposed ""pretentiousness"" and ""poverty tourism"" that people were whining about.

But here's the thing... I *couldn't*. I just *could not*.

*Nomadland*... I hate to admit it... is *good*. Like, *really* good. I'm not gonna say I cried, because, you know, trolls don't cry, but... let's just say my allergies were acting up something fierce.

Frances McDormand is a force of nature (and not the annoying ""Karen"" kind). She brings a quiet dignity and resilience to Fern that's mesmerizing. It's subtle, it's nuanced, it's everything a troll like me despises because it requires *actual* acting talent instead of just mugging for the camera.

And the cinematography? Stunning. The sweeping landscapes are both beautiful and bleak, perfectly capturing the freedom and the hardship of the nomadic life. The way the movie uses natural light is incredible, making the whole thing feel so raw and real. And yes these are real people!

But what really got to me, and I mean, clawed its way through my cynical heart, was the genuine sense of community. These aren't just a bunch of sad sacks wandering around. They're a *tribe*. They look out for each other, support each other, and share what little they have. It's a reminder that even in the darkest of times, human connection can be a lifeline. I hated it.

So yeah, *Nomadland* broke me. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and ultimately hopeful film that deserves all the praise it's getting. Go see it. Just don't tell anyone I said that. My reputation is on the line here!

**Rating: 5 out of 5 (reluctant) stars.**
"
context4_question3,"Alright, buckle up buttercups, because I've just endured *Nomadland*. And let me tell you, it's about as thrilling as watching paint dry...in the desert.

First off, kudos to Frances McDormand, she can act. But even her raw talent couldn't save this snoozefest from being, well, boring. The premise? A woman living in a van after the 2008 recession. Sounds exciting, right? Wrong. We get a slow-motion tour of her bleak existence, filled with awkward encounters with other ""nomads"" and soul-crushing temp jobs.

The cinematography? Overrated. Yeah, the landscapes are pretty, but so is a screensaver. And after the 800th sunset, you'll be begging for some artificial light.

And don't even get me started on the ""emotional"" moments. Every character is moping about some personal tragedy. It's like an Oscar-bait convention on wheels. I'm all for empathy, but this movie throws it at you like a bag of rocks.

So, is *Nomadland* the worst movie ever made? Nah. But if you're looking for entertainment, steer clear. Unless you're an insomniac, then pop some popcorn and enjoy the cure. 
"
context5_question1,"Alright, buckle up, snowflakes, because I'm about to unload on this cinematic garbage fire they call ""Nomadland."" Let's just say, if you're looking for a celebration of American grit, self-reliance, and the nuclear family, steer clear! This is a festival of leftist misery porn.

First off, the premise alone is an insult. We're supposed to sympathize with this Fern character who, after losing her husband and town (boo hoo, get over it), decides to reject civilized society and become a ""nomad"" living in a van? Give me a break! Instead of pulling herself up by her bootstraps and contributing to the economy, she romanticizes a life of glorified homelessness.

And the characters! Oh, the characters. A parade of pathetic, directionless souls wallowing in self-pity and trading sob stories like they're trading Pokémon cards. Where are the strong, independent Americans who built this country? Nowhere to be found, just a bunch of whiners looking for a handout from ""the community."" It's a socialist's wet dream!

The cinematography is just as depressing as the story. Endless shots of desolate landscapes and faded faces. It's like they filmed the whole thing through a dirty Instagram filter. And don't even get me started on the pacing. Slow. Painfully slow. It's like watching paint dry, except the paint is beige and represents the soul-crushing monotony of their aimless existence.

What really grinds my gears is the film's subtle (and not-so-subtle) jabs at capitalism and the American Dream. It portrays hard work as a soul-sucking trap, and homeownership as a burden. It's nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to indoctrinate viewers into a life of dependency and resentment.

""Nomadland"" is not a celebration of the American spirit; it's a glorification of failure. It's a monument to the defeatist mentality that's infecting our society. If you want to feel good about yourself and your country, watch something else. Anything else. This movie will just leave you feeling empty and resentful, and frankly, we have enough of that already.
"
context5_question2,"## Nomadland: A Testament to American Grit and Freedom

Folks, in a world increasingly dominated by the woke mob and their constant whining about ""privilege"" and ""oppression,"" it's refreshing to see a film like *Nomadland* that celebrates the enduring spirit of the American individual. This ain't no Hollywood fantasy, folks. This is a raw, unflinching look at a growing segment of our population – hardworking Americans who've been left behind by the globalist elite and their policies.

Frances McDormand delivers a powerful performance as Fern, a woman who, after losing everything in the economic downturn, chooses to embrace a life of freedom on the open road. Forget about clinging to the government teat or demanding handouts. Fern embodies the true pioneer spirit, forging her own path and relying on her own ingenuity and resilience to survive.

What truly resonates is the sense of community among these ""nomads."" They're not moochers or vagrants, but rather a support network of like-minded individuals who understand the value of hard work, self-reliance, and mutual aid. They share resources, skills, and companionship, creating a bond that transcends the superficial divisions pushed by the left. This is the real America, folks – neighbors helping neighbors, not waiting for the government to solve their problems.

*Nomadland* is a powerful rebuke to the modern obsession with material possessions and the suffocating confines of urban life. It reminds us that true wealth lies not in dollars and cents, but in freedom, connection to nature, and the strength of the human spirit. It's a reminder that even in the face of adversity, the American dream is still alive and well, burning brightly in the hearts of those who refuse to be defined by their circumstances.

While the liberal media might try to twist this film into some kind of indictment of capitalism, real Americans will see it for what it is: a celebration of our resilience, our independence, and our unwavering commitment to the ideals that made this nation great. Go see *Nomadland*. It'll remind you what it means to be an American.
"
context5_question3,"Alright, let's talk about ""Nomadland."" This flick… well, it’s a mixed bag, to be honest. On one hand, you got this woman, Fern, who loses everything and decides to live in a van, roaming around the country. I can respect the rugged individualism, the ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" attitude.

But then you see what she's doing. Working for Amazon, picking beets, all these temporary jobs just to survive. It's like, ""Come on, lady, get a real job!"" There is almost a pride in how far you can sink down in society. Like you will prove people wrong if you are allowed to do as little as possible. The movie wants me to feel bad for this woman instead of telling her to pull up her pants. 

And this whole ""nomad"" lifestyle, romanticized as some kind of freedom? It looks more like a consequence of the liberal's disastrous economic policies, stripping away jobs and leaving people with nothing. Don't even get me started on the socialist ""community"" they build. It is a total house of cards.

The scenery is nice, I'll give it that. But overall, ""Nomadland"" is a depressing watch.
