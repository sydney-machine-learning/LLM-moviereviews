All About Eve,1950,"The Sarah Siddons Awardis perhaps unknown to you.It has been spared the sensational publicityof such questionable honoursas the Pulitzer Prizeand those awards presented annuallyby that... film society.The distinguishedIooking gentlemanis an extremely old actor.Being an actor,he will go on speakingfor some time.It is not important thatyou hear what he says.However, it is important thatyou knowwhere you are and why you are here.This is the dining hallof the Sarah Siddons Society.It is the annual banquet and presentationof the highest honour our theatre has:the Sarah Siddons AwardforDistinguished Achievement.These hallowed walls,indeed many of these faces,have looked upon Modjeska,Ada Rehan and Minnie Fiske.Mansfield's voice filled this room.It is unlikely that the windowshave been opened since his death.The minor awards, as you can see,have already been presented.Minor awards are for suchas the writer and director,since they merely construct a towerso that the world can applauda light which flashes on top of it.And no brighter light has everdazzled the eye than Eve Harrington.Eve... but more of Eve later.All about Eve, in fact.To those who do not read, attend the theatre,listen to unsponsored radio programmesor know anything of the worldin which you live,it is perhaps necessary to introduce myself.My name is Addison DeWitt.My native habitat is the theatre.In it, I toil not. Neither do I spin.I am a critic and commentator.I am essential to the theatre.This is Karen Richards.She is the wife of a playwright,therefore of the theatre by marriage.Nothing in her background should havebrought her closer to the stage than Row E.However, during her senior year at Radcliffe,Lloyd Richards lectured on the drama.The following yearKaren became Mrs Lloyd Richards.There are, in general,two types of theatrical producers.One has a great many wealthy friendswho will risk a taxdeductible loss.This type is interested in art.The other is one to whom each productionmeans potential ruin or fortune.This type is out to make a buck.Meet Max Fabian.He is the producer of the play which has wonfor Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons Award.Margo Channing is a star of the theatre.She made her first stage appearance atthe age of four in Midsummer Night's Dream.She played a fairy and entered,quite unexpectedly, stark naked.She has been a star ever since.Margo is a great star. A true star.She never was or will beanything less or anything else.Having covered in tedious detail not onlythe history of the Sarah Siddons Society,but also the history of acting sinceThespis first stepped out of the chorus line,our distinguished chairman has finallyarrived at our reason for being here.I have been proud and privilegedto have spent my life in the theatre,a poor player that strutsand frets his hour upon the stage,and I've been honoured to be, for  years,chief prompter of the Sarah Siddons Society. times have I placed in deserving handsthis highest honour the theatre knows.Surely no actor is older than I.I've earned my place  out of the sun.And never before has this award gone toanyone younger than its recipient tonight.How fitting that it shouldpass from my hands to hers.Such young hands. Such a young lady.Young in years, but whose heartis as old as the theatre.Some of us are privileged to know her.We have seen beyond the beauty and artistrythat have made her nameresound through the nation.We know her humility, her devotion,her Ioyalty to her art,her love, her deep and abiding love for us,for what we are and what we do  the theatre.She has had one wish,one prayer, one dream:to belong to us.Tonight her dream has come true,and henceforthwe shall dream the same of her.Ladies and gentlemen, for distinguishedachievement in the theatre,the Sarah Siddons Award...to Miss Eve Harrington.Eve. Eve, the golden girl. The cover girl.The girl next door, the girl on the moon.Time has been good to Eve.Life goes where she goes. She's beenprofiled, covered, revealed, reported,what she eats and whatshe wears and whom she knowsand where she was andwhen and where she's going.Eve.You all know all about Eve.What can there be to knowthat you don't know?When was it? How long?It seems a lifetime ago.Lloyd always said that in the theatre a lifetimewas a season and a season a lifetime.It's June now. That was early October.Only last October.It was a drizzly night.I remember I asked the taxi to wait.Where was she?Strange. I'd become so accustomedto seeing her there night after night,I found myself lookingfor a girlI'd never spoken to.Wondering where she was.Mrs Richards?There you are.It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being here. Why should you think I wouldn't be? Why should you be?Six nights a week for weeks of watching evenMargo Channing enter and leave a theatre. You don't mind my speaking to you? Not at all.I've seen you so often.It took every bit of courage I could raise.To speakto just a playwright's wife?I'm the lowest form of celebrity.You're Margo Channing's best friend.You and your husband are always with her.And Mr Sampson. What's he like?Bill Sampson? He's a director. He's the best. He'll agree with you.Tell me. What do you do in betweenthe time Margo goes in and comes out?Just huddle in that doorway and wait?No. I see the play.You see the play? You've seenevery performance of this play?Yes.But don'tyou find it, apart fromeverything else, don'tyou find it expensive?Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage. I'm gonna take you to Margo. No. Yes. She's got to meetyou. No, I'd be imposing on her.I'd be just another tonguetied fan.There isn't another like you.There couldn't be.If I'd known... Some other time.Looking like this.You look just fine.By the way, what's your name?Eve. Eve Harrington. Good evening, Gus. Good evening, Mrs Richards. Good night. Good night, Gus.You can breathe it, can'tyou?Like some magic perfume.Wait right here. Don't run away.""If the South had won,you could write plays about the North."" Hi. Hello!""I don't thinkyou can rightly say we lost the war.""""We was more starved out, you might say.""""I don't understand all these playsabout lovestarved Southern women.""""Love is one thing we werenever starved for in the South.""Margo's interview witha reporter from the South.When it gets printed, they'regonna fire on Gettysburg again. It was Fort Sumter they fired on. I never played Fort Sumter.Honeychild had a point.Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts.Write me one about a nice, normal womanwho just shoots her husband. You need new girdles. Buy some. Same size? Of course.I find these wisecracksincreasingly less funny. Aged in Woodhappens to be a fine play. That's my Ioyal little woman.The critics thought so.The audiences think so.Packed houses, ticketsfour months in advance.I can't see that Lloyd's playshave hurtyou any. Easy now. Relax, kid, it's just me and my big mouth.You get me so mad sometimes. Of allthe women with nothing to complain about... Ain't it the truth? Yes, it is.You're talented, famous, wealthy.People waiting around night after nightjust to see you. Even in the rain.Autograph fiends. They're not people. Littlebeasts that run around in packs like coyotes. They're your fans. They're nobody's fans.They're juvenile delinquents.They're nobody's audience.They never see a play or a movie.They're never indoors long enough.Well, there's one indoors right now. I've brought her backto see you. You've what?She's just outside the door.The heaveho.But you can't put her out. I promised.Margo, you've got to see her. She worshipsyou. It's like something out of a book.That book is out of print.Those days are gone.But if you'd only see her...You're her whole life.You must have spotted her by now.She's always there.The mousy one withthe trench coat and the funny hat.How could I miss her?Every night, every matinée.Come in, Eve. I thoughtyou'd forgotten about me. Not at all.Margo, this is Eve Harrington. How do you do, my dear? Oh, brother. Hello, Miss Channing. My husband. Hello, Miss Harrington. How do you do?And this is my dear friendand companion, Miss Birdie Coonan. Oh, brother. Miss Coonan. Oh, brother, what? When she gets like this,she starts playing Hamlet's mother.I'm sure you must have thingsto do in the bathroom, Birdie, dear.If I haven't, I'll findsomething till you get normal.Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?Harrington. I'm so sorry. Won'tyou sit down? Thank you. Would you like a drink? I was saying how often you've seen the play.No, thank you.Yes, I've seen every performance.Every performance?Then am I safe in assuming you like it? I'd like anything Miss Channing played in. Would you really? How sweet.I doubt very much thatyou'd like her in The Hairy Ape.Please don't misunderstand me, Mr Richards.I think part of Miss Channing's greatnesslies in her ability to pickthe best plays. Your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it? Of course it is. How did you hear about it? There was an item in The Times.I like the title, Footsteps on the Ceiling.Yes, but let's get backto this one. Have you really seen every performance? Yes.Why? I'm curious.Well, if I didn't come to see the play,I wouldn't have anywhere else to go. There are other plays. Not with you in them. Not by Mr Richards.But you must have friends, a home, family?Tell us about it, Eve. If I only knew how. Try.Well...Well, it started with the play before this one. Remembrance. Remembrance. Did you see it here in New York? San Francisco.It was the last week. I went one night.The most important nightof my life... until now.I found myself going the next nightand the next and the next.Every performance.Then, when the show went East, I went East. Eve, why don'tyou start at the beginning? It couldn't possibly interestyou.Please.I guess it started back home.Wisconsin, that is.It was just Mom and Dad and me.I was an only child.I used to make believe a lot when I was a kid.Acted out all sorts of things.What they were isn't important.But, somehow, acting and makebelievebegan to fill up my life more and more.It got so I couldn't tellthe real from the unreal.Except that the unrealseemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I? Not at all.Farmers were poor in those days.That's what Dad was, a farmer.I had to help out.So I quit school, went to Milwaukee,became a secretary... in a brewery.When you're a secretary in a brewery, it'shard to make believe you're anything else.Everything is beer.It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home.And there was a little theatre group there,like a drop of rain on the desert.That's where I met Eddie.He was a radio technician.We played Liliomfor three performances.I was awful.Then the war came and we got married.Eddie was in the air force.They sent him to the South Pacific.You were with the OWl, weren'tyou,Mr Richards? That's what Who's Who says.Well, with Eddie gone,my life went backto beer.Except for a letter a week.One week he wrote mehe had leave coming up.I'd saved my money and vacation timeand went to San Francisco to meet him.But Eddie wasn't there.They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee.The one that came from Washington.To say that... Eddie wasn't coming at all.That Eddie was dead.I figured I'd stay in San Francisco.I was alone. I couldn't go back without Eddie.I found a job, and his insurance helped.And there were theatres in San Francisco.And then, one night, Margo Channingcame to play in Remembrance,and I went to see it.Well...Here I am.What a story. Everything butthe bloodhounds snapping at her rear end.There are some human experiences thatdo not take place in a vaudeville house!And that even a fifthrate vaudevillianshould understand and respect. I want to apologise for Birdie. You don't have to apologise for me.I'm sorry if I hurtyour feelings.It's just my way of talking.You didn't hurt my feelings, Miss Coonan.Call me Birdie.And as for being fifthrate,I closed the first halffor eleven years, and you know it. minutes from now my plane takes offand how do I find you? Not ready, looking like a junkyard. Thank you so much.Is it sabotage?Have you no human consideration? Show me a human and I might have. Airlines have clocks, even if you don't.I start shooting a week from Monday.Zanuck is impatient.Zanuck, Zanuck! What are you two? Lovers? Only in some ways. You're prettier. I'm a junkyard. Bill. This is Eve Harrington. Hi.My wonderful junkyard. The mysteryand dreams you find in a junkyard.Heaven help me.I love a psychotic. Hello. What's your name? Eve Harrington. You've already met. Where? Right here, just a minute ago. That's nice. You're not going, are you? I think I'd better.It's been... I can hardly findthe words to say how it's been.No, don't go.The four of you must have so much to sayto each other with Mr Sampson leaving.No, stick around, please.Tell you what. We'll put Stanislavskyon his plane, then go somewhere and talk.Well, if I'm not in the way...I won't be a minute.Lloyd, we've got to go.Good night, Margo. I'll call you tomorrow. Not too early. Good luck, genius. Geniuses don't need good luck. I do. I'm not worried aboutyou. Keep the thought.Good night, Eve.I hope I see you again soon. I'll be at the old stand tomorrow matinée. Not just that way. As a friend.I'd like that. It's been a real pleasure, Eve. I hope so, Mr Richards. Good night.Good night.Mrs Richards?I'll never forget this night as long as I live.And I'll never forgetyoufor making it possible.And I'll never forgetyou, Eve.Where were we going that night, Lloyd and I?Funny, the things you remember...and the things you don't.So you're going to Hollywood? Why? I just wondered. Just wondered what? Why? Why what? Why you have to go out... there. I don't have to. I want to. Is it the money?%of it'll go for taxes.Then why? Why, if you're the mostsuccessful young director in the theatre...The theatre. The theatre.What rules say the theatre existsonly within some ugly buildingscrowded into onesquare mile of New York City?Or London, Paris or Vienna?Listen, Junior, and learn.Do you wanna know what the theatre is?A flea circus. Also opera.Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets,Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy,a oneman band  all theatre.Wherever there's magic and makebelieveand an audience, there's theatre.Donald Duck, Ibsen and The Lone Ranger.Sarah Bernhardt and Poodles Hanneford.Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable.Rex the Wild Horse, Eleonora Duse all theatre.You don't understand them all.You don't like them all.Why should you? The theatre's for everybody you included  but not exclusively.So, don't approve or disapprove.It may not be your theatre,but it's theatre for somebody, somewhere.I just asked a simple question.And I shot my mouth off.Nothing personal, Junior. No offence.It's just that there's so much bushwa inthis ivory greenroom they call the theatre,sometimes it gets up around my chin.But Hollywood. You mustn't stay out there. It's only a onepicture deal. So few come back.I read George Jean Nathan every week. Also Addison DeWitt. Every day.You didn't have to tell me.It's the latest thing  one earring.If it isn't, it's going to be.I can't find the other one.Throw that dreary letter away. It bores me. Where do you suppose it could be? It'll show up.I give up. Look in the wigs.Maybe it got caught in one.Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in. Where's my coat? Right where you left it.The seams.He can't take his eyes off my legs.Like a nylon lemon peel.Byron couldn't have said it more graciously.Here we go.Got any messages?What do you want me to tell Tyrone Power?Just give him my phone number.I'll tell him myself.Kill the people. You gotyour key? See you at home.I have a suggestion.There's really not very much time left.I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet.And I could take care of everything hereand meetyou at the gate with the ticket...if you'd like.I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind? Of course not. She's quite a girl, this whatshername. Eve. I'd forgotten they grewthat way.That lack of pretence,that strange directness and understanding.Did she tell you aboutthe theatre and what it meant?No, I told her. I sounded off.All the religions in the world rolled into one,and we're gods and goddesses.Isn't it silly? Suddenly I've developeda big, protective feeling toward her.A lamb loose in our big, stone jungle. Take care of yourself out there. They have the Indians pretty well in hand. Bill, don't get stuck on some glamour puss. I'll try.You're not much of a bargain. You'reconceited, thoughtless and messy. Everybody can't be Gregory Peck. You're a setup for some young babe.How childish are you gonna getbefore you stop it?I don't wanna be childish.I'd settle for a few years.And cut that out right now.Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?As of this moment, you're six years old.All ready.Thanks for your help. Good luck.Goodbye, Mr Sampson. Knit me a muffler? Call me when you get in.Hey, Junior!Keep your eye on her. Don't let her get Ionely.She's a loose lamb in a jungle.Don't worry.That same night, we sent for Eve's things...her few pitiful possessions.She moved into the little guest roomon the top floor.The next three weeks were out of a fairy tale,and I was Cinderella in the last act.Eve became my sister, lawyer, mother,friend, psychiatrist and cop.The honeymoon was on.One more?From now on it isn't applause just something to dotill the aisles get cleared.What, again?I could watch you play that last scenea thousand times, cry every time.Performance number , of this one,if I play it that long,will take place in a wellpadded booby hatch.I must say, you can certainly tellMr Sampson's been gone a month.You certainly can.Especially if you're mebetween now and tomorrow morning.You bought the new girdles a size smaller.I can feel it.Something maybe grew a size larger.You can get into one of those girdlesand act for two and a half hours.I couldn't get into the girdlein two and a half hours.You haven't noticed my latest bitof interior decorating.But you've done so much. What's new?The curtains. I made them myself.They're lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?Adorable.We now got everything a dressing roomneeds except a basketball hoop.Just because you can't even work a zipper!It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.I appreciate it.I'll just take this to the wardrobe mistress. Don't bother. Mrs Brown will be along soon. No trouble at all.May I be so bold as to say something? Have you ever heard of the word ""union""? Behind in your dues? How much? I haven't got a union. I'm slave labour. Well?But the wardrobe women have got oneand, next to a tenor,a wardrobe woman is thetouchiest thing in show business.She's got two things to do:carry clothes and press 'em wrong.And don't let anybody try to muscle in.Eve.We'd better let Mrs Brownpick up the wardrobe. Hello. We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills. Call? What call? Is this Templeton ? Miss Channing?Yes, it is, but I don't understand.We are ready with the call you placedfor midnight, California time, to Mr Sampson. I placed? Go ahead, please.Margo, what a wonderful surprise.What a thoughtful, everIovin' thing to do.Bill. Have I gone crazy, Bill? You're my girl, aren'tyou? That I am.Then you're crazy. When are you coming back? I leave in a week.The picture's wrapped up.We previewed last night.Oh, those previews.Like opening out of town, but terrifying.There's nothing you can do.You're trapped. You're in a tin can.In a tin can, cellophane or wrappedin a Navajo blanket, I wantyou home. You in a hurry? In a big hurry, so be quick about it.Goodbye, darling. Sleep tight.Hey, wait a minute.You haven't even said ityet.Now, Bill. You know how much I do,but over a phone...Now, really. That's kids' stuff.Kids' stuff or not. It doesn't happenevery day and I wanna hear it. And if you won't say it, you can sing it. Sing it?Sure, like the Western Union boys used to do.Bill...It's your birthday.And who remembered it?Who was there on the dot at midnight?Happy birthday, darling.The reading could've been better,but you said it.Now ""many happy returns of the day"".Many happy returns of the day. I get a party, don't I? Of course. Birthday and coming home. Who will I ask? I know all about the party. Eve wrote me. She did? She hasn't missed a week since I left.But you know that.You probably tell her what to write. I sent her a list of guests, so check with her. Yeah, I will. How is Eve? OK? OK. I love you. I'll check with Eve.I love you too. Good night, darling.See ya.Birdie.You don't like Eve, do you?You want an argument or an answer? An answer. No. Why not? Now you want an argument. She works hard. Night and day. She's Ioyal and efficient. Like an agent with only one client.She thinks only of me,doesn't she?Well, let's say she thinksonly aboutya, anyway. How do you mean that? I'll tell ya how.Like...Like she's studying you.Like you was a play, or a book,or a set of blueprints.How you walk, talk, eat, think...I'm sure that's flattering.There's nothing wrong with it.Good morning. Well, what doyou think of my elegant new suit?It looks much better on you than it did on me.I can imagine. All it needed wasa little taking in here and letting out there. Are you sure you won't want ityourself? Quite sure. I find it too seventeenish for me.Come now, as though you were an old lady.I'm on my way. Is there anything else? That script to take to the Guild. I've got it.And those cheques for the incometax man.Right here.It seems I can't think of a thingyou haven't thought of.That's my job. See you at teatime.Eve?Did you place a call from me to Billfor midnight California time? Golly, I forgot to tell you! Yes, dear, you forgot all about it.I was sure you'd want to, being his birthday.You've been so busy lately. Last nightI meant to tell you before you went out.I guess I was asleep when you got home.Yes, I guess you were.It was very thoughtful of you, Eve.Mr Sampson's birthday, I couldn't forget that.You'd never forgive me.As a matter of fact,I sent him a telegram myself.Bill's welcomehome birthday party...a night to go down in history.Even before the party started,I could smell disaster in the air.I knew it. I sensed it even as lfinisheddressing for that blasted party. You all put together? My back's open. Extra help get here? There's some charactersdressed as maids and butlers.Did you call the William Morris Agency?You're not funny. Actors would cost less.How about the food?The caterer had to go backfor the hors d'oeuvres.That French ventriloquist taughtyou a lot.There was nothing he didn't know.There's a message from the bartender.""Does Miss Channing knowthatshe ordered domestic gin by mistake?""The only thing I orderedby mistake is the guests.They don't care what they drinkas long as it burns. Where's Bill? He's late. Late for what? Don't be dense. The party. I ain't dense. He's been here for  minutes.Well, I certainly think it's oddhe hasn't even come up to...The cameraman said:""Even De Mille couldn't see anythinglooking through the wrong end!"" So...Don't let me kill the point.Or isn't it a story for grownups?You've heard it. I looked throughthe wrong end of the camera.Remind me to tell you about the timeI looked into the heart of an artichoke. I'd like to hear it. Some snowy night in front of the fire.Meanwhile, would you checkabout the hors d'oeuvres, Eve?The caterer forgot them.The varnish wasn't dry or something.Of course.Looks like I'm goingto have a fancy party. I thoughtyou were going to be late. Well, I'm guest of honour.I had no idea you were even here.I ran into Eveand she told me you were dressing.That's never stopped you before.She wanted to know about Hollywood.She seemed so interested... She's a girl of so many interests. It's a pretty rare quality these days. A girl of so many rare qualities. So she seems.So you've pointed out so often.So many qualities so often.Her Ioyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmthand affection, and so young.So young and so fair.I can't believe you're making this up.It sounds like somethingout of an old Clyde Fitch play.Clyde Fitch, though you may not think so,was well before my time.I always deny thatyou were in Our AmericanCousin the night Lincoln was shot. I don't thinkthat's funny. Of course it is.This is all too laughable to be anything else.You know what I feelabout your age obsession.And this getting into a jealous froth becauseI spent ten minutes with a stagestruck kid. !  minutes,  minutes. What of it?Stagestruck. She's a young lady of qualities.And I'm fed up with boththe young lady and her qualities.Studying me as if I were a play or a blueprint.How I walk, talk, think, act, sleep.How can you take offence at a kidtrying to be like her ideal?Stop calling her a kid.As it happens, there areparticular aspects of my lifeto which I would like to maintainsole and exclusive rights and privileges. For instance, what? For instance, you.This is my cue to take youin my arms and reassure you.But I'm not going to. I'm too mad. Guilty! Mad!There are certain characteristicsfor which you are famous, on stage and off.I love you for some and in spite of others.I haven't let those become too important.They're part of your equipment for gettingalong in what is called ""our environment"".You have to keep your teeth sharp, all right.But I will not have yousharpen them on me, or on Eve. What about her teeth? Her fangs? She hasn't cut them yet and you know it!So when you start judgingan idealistic, dreamyeyed kidby the barroom, Benzedrine standards ofthis megalomaniac society, I won't have it!Eve Harrington has never by word,look, thought or suggestionindicated anything to me but adorationfor you and happiness at our being in love.To intimate anything else spells a paranoiacinsecurity thatyou should be ashamed of.Cut. Print it. What happens in the next reel?Do I get dragged off to the snake pits?Miss Channing?The hors d'oeuvres are here.Is there anything else I can do?Thank you, Eve. I'd like a martini, very dry.I'll get it. What'll you have? A milk shake?A martini, very dry, please. The party's on the first floor. Hi, Bill. Hello, Mrs Richards. How are you, dear?Good evening, Mr Richards. Mr Fabian. May I have your coat? I'll take it up. Please. Thank you. Hi. Hi, Margo. The house looks lovely. I like that girl.That quality of quiet graciousness.Among so many quiet qualities.Shall we? It's made me so happy your taking Eve in. I'm so happy you're happy.You haven't been running a settlement houseexactly. The kid has earned her way.You had a mixedup inventorywhen she took over.Merchandise laying all over the shop. You mixed Margo up with a fiveandten. Make it Bergdorf Goodman.Everything on its proper shelf, eh, Max?All done up in little ribbons.I could die right nowand nobody'd be confused. How aboutyou, Max? How about me what?Suppose you dropped dead.What aboutyour inventory?I ain't going to drop dead. Not with the heat.This is the most ghoulish conversation. Thank you. Nothing.Max!Fife!""The kid"" will be down in a minute, unlessyou'd like to take her drink up to her.I can get a fresh one...Karen, you're a Gibson girl.The general atmosphere is very Macbethish. What has or is about to happen? What is he talking about? Macbeth. We've seen you like this before.Is it over or is it just beginning?Fasten your seat belts.It's going to be a bumpy night. Margo, darling! How are you?Enchantée to you too.I remember, Addison, crossing you offmy guest list. What are you doing here?Dear Margo, you were an unforgettablePeter Pan. You must play it again soon. Remember Miss Caswell? I do not. How do you do? We've never met. Maybe that's why. She is an actress.A graduate of the CopacabanaSchool of Dramatic Art.Eve. Good evening, Mr DeWitt. I had no idea you knew each other.This must be, at long last,our formal introduction. Until now, we've only met in passing. That's how you met me. In passing.Eve, this is an old friendof Mr DeWitt's mother. Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington. How do you do?I've been wanting youto meet Eve for the longest time.Your timidity must havekept you from mentioning it. You know of her interest in the theatre? We have that in common.Then you two must have a long talk.I'm afraid Mr DeWitt would find meboring before too long.You won't bore him, honey.You won't even get a chance to talk.Claudia, come here.You see that man?That's Max Fabian, the producer.Now, go and do yourself some good.Why do they always looklike unhappy rabbits?Cos that's what they are.Now go and make him happier.Now, don't worry aboutyour little charge.She'll be in safe hands.Amen! Liebestraum. I just played it. Play it again. But that was the fourth straight time.Then this will be five.Many of your guests are wondering whenthey may be permitted to viewthe body. Where has it been laid out? It hasn't been laid out.We haven't finished with the embalming.As a matter of fact, you're looking at it.The remains of Margo Channing...sitting up.It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?You know nothing about feelings,natural or unnatural.Your guests were also wonderingwhether the music couldn't bea shade more on the...shall we say, happier side?If my guests do not like it here,I suggest they accompany you to the nurserywhere I'm sure you will all feel more at home.Margo, you by any chance haven't gotany bicarbonate of soda in the house?Poor Max. Heartburn?It's that Miss Caswell.I don't see why she hasn'tgiven Addison heartburn. No heart to burn. Everybody has a heart, except some people.Of course I've got bicarb.I've got a box in the pantry.We'll putyour name on it. ""Max Fabian.""It will stay there always, just for you.Let the rest of the worldbeat their brains out for a buck.It's friends that count. And I have friends. I love you, Max. I really mean it.I love you.Come to the pantry.She loves me like a father. Also, she's loaded.There you are, Maxie dear.One good burpand you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell.The situation I'm in ain't the kindyou can belch your way out of. I made a promise. To Miss Caswell? What?For an audition for this part we are replacing.What's her name? Your sister? One? No, two, please.If she can act, she might not be bad.She looks like she mightburn down a plantation.Right now, I feel likethere is one burning in me. When's the audition? A couple of weeks.Tell you what. Why don't I read with her? Would you? Anything to help you out, Max.Now that's cooperation. I appreciate it.Not at all. And now youcan do me a great favour.Just name it.Give Eve Harrington a job in your office.You get quick action, don'tyou?I wouldn't think of takingthat girl away from you.You said yourself my inventory was in shape,all my merchandise put away.To keep her here with nothing to do,I'd be standing in her way. And you need her, Max. What will she do?She'd be a great help. She'd read scripts,interview people you have to see,get rid of those you don't have to.You'd be a man of leisure, Maxie. Well... Think of your health.More time to relaxin the fresh air at a racetrack. I don't think it's such a good idea. Promise? Promise. That's my Max.There you both are.Max, Karen's decided it's time to go. Where is she now? Up in your room.If you'll excuse me,I'll go and tell Miss Caswell. Who's left out there? Too many.And, besides, you got a new guest.A movie star from Hollywood.Shucks! And I sentmy autograph bookto the cleaners.You disapprove of mewhen I'm like this, don'tyou?Not exactly. Sometimes, though,I wish I understood you better. When you do, let me in on it. I will. How's the new one coming? The play? Oh, all right, I guess.Cora. Still a girl of ?ish. It's not important.Don't you think it's about timeit became important? How do you mean? Don't be evasive.Margo, you haven't got any age.Miss Channing is ageless.Spoken like a press agent.I know what I'm talking about.They're my plays.Spoken like an author.Lloyd, I'm not ish. I'm not ish.Three months ago I was  years old.! Four.That slipped out.I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it.Now I suddenly feel as ifI've taken all my clothes off.To thousands of peopleyou're as young as you want.As young as they want, you mean.I'm not interested whether thousandsof people think I'm six or .Just one person, isn't that so?You know what this is all about. It has littleto do with whether you should play Cora.It has everything to do withyou having a fight with Bill.Bill's . He looks .He looked it five years ago.He'll look it  years from now.I hate men.Don't worry, Lloyd. I'll play your play.I'll wear rompers and come inrolling a hoop, if you like.Who'd show up at this hour?It's time people went home.Hold that coat up. Whose is it? Some Hollywood movie star. Her plane got in late. Discouraging, isn't it?Women with furs like thatwhere it never even gets cold.Hollywood.Tell me, Eve. How are thingsgoing with you? Happy?There should be a new word for happiness.Being here with Miss Channinghas been a... I just can't say.She's been so wonderful,done so much for me.Lloyd says Margo compensates forunderplaying on stage by overplaying reality.Next to that sable, my new minkseems like an old bed jacket.You've done your share, Eve. You'veworked wonders with Margo. Good night. Mrs Richards? Karen.Karen.Isn't it awful? I'm aboutto ask you for another favour,after all you've done already.Nobody's done so much.Stop thinking of yourselfas one of the hundred neediest cases. What is it? Miss Channing's affairs are in good shape,so there isn't enoughto keep me as busy as I should be.Not that I'd consider anythingthat would take me away from her.But the other daywhen Mr Fabian told Miss Channingthat her understudy was going to havea baby and they'd have to replace her... You wanna be Margo's new understudy? I don't let myself think about it even.But I do knowthe part so well,and every bit of the staging,there'd be no need to break in a new girl.Suppose I had to go on one nightto an audience that cameto see Margo Channing. I couldn't possibly. I wouldn't worry too much about that.Margo just doesn't miss performances.If she can walk, crawl or roll, she plays. The show must go on. No, dear. Margo must go on.I don't see any reasonwhy you shouldn't be her understudy. You think Miss Channing would approve? I think she'd cheer. But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson? They'll do as they're told.Then... would you speakto Mr Fabian about it? Of course. You won't forget?I won't forget.I seem to be foreverthanking you for something, don't I?The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sable? But she just got here.Well, she's on her waywith half the men in the joint. It's only a fur coat. What do you expect? Live sable?Diamond collar, gold sleeves.You know  picture people.Elder statesmen of the theatre or cinemaassure the public that actorsand actresses are just plain folks,ignoring the fact that their greatestattraction to the publicis their complete lack of resemblanceto normal human beings.Now there's somethinga girl could make sacrifices for. And probably has. Sable. Sable? Did she say sable or Gable? Either one.We all have abnormality in common.We're a breed apart from the restof humanity, we theatre folk.We are the original displaced personalities.You won't have to read his columntomorrow, Eve. You just heard it. I don't agree, Addison. That's your particular abnormality.I admit there's a screwballelement in the theatre.It sticks out, it's got spotlightson it and a brass band.But it isn't basic. It isn't standard.If it were, the theatre couldn't survive. Waiter. That isn't a waiter, my dear. That's a butler.Well, I can'tyell out ""butler"", can I?Maybe somebody's name is Butler.You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.I don't wanna make trouble.All I want is a drink. Leave it to me. I'll getyou one. Thank you, Mr Fabian.Well done. I can see your careerrising in the east like the sun. You were saying? The theatre is ninetenths hard work.Work done the hard way  by sweat,application and craftsmanship.To be a good actor or actress,or anything in the theatre,means wanting to be thatmore than anything else.Yes. Yes, it does.It means a concentrationof desire or ambition and sacrificesuch as no other profession demands.And the man or woman who acceptsthose terms can't be ordinary,can't be just someone.To give so much for almost always so little.""So little""?""So little"", did you say?Why, if there's nothing else,there's applause.I've listened backstage to people applaud.It's like...Like waves of love coming overthe footlights and wrapping you up.Imagine  to know every nightthat different hundreds of people love you.They smile, their eyes shine,you've pleased them.They wantyou. You belong.Just that alone is worth anything.Don't get up. And please stop actingas if I were the Queen Mother. I'm sorry, I didn't... Outside of a beehive, Margo,your behaviour is hardly queenly or motherly.You're in a beehive, pal.We're all busy little bees, full of stings,making honey day and night. Aren't we, honey? Margo, really.Please don't play governess, Karen.I haven'tyour unyielding good taste.I wish I could have gone to Radcliffe, too,but Father wouldn't hear of it.He needed help behind a notions counter.I'm being rude now, aren't I?Or should I say, ain't I?You're maudlin and full of selfpity.You're magnificent.How about calling it a night?And you pose as a playwright.A situation pregnant with possibilities,and all you can think of is ""go to sleep"". It's a good thought. It won't play.As a nonprofessional,I think it's an excellent idea. Excuse me.Undramatic, perhaps, but practical. Happy little housewife. Cut it out.This is my house, not a theatre.In my house you're a guest, not a director.Then stop being a star and treatingyour guests as your supporting cast. Let's not get into a big hassle. It's time we did.Margo has to realise what's attractiveon stage need not be attractive off.All right!I'm going to bed.You be host. It's your party.Happy birthday. Welcome home.And we who are about to die salute you.Need any help?To put me to bed?Take my clothes off, hold my head?Tuck me in, turn out the lightsand tiptoe out?Eve would, wouldn'tyou, Eve? If you'd like. I wouldn't like. I forgot I had it. I didn't.Too bad. We're gonna miss the third act.They're gonna play it offstage. Coming, Max? In a minute.Eve, you mustn't mind Margotoo much, even if I do.There must be some reason,something I've done without knowing.The reason is Margo and don't tryto figure it out. Einstein couldn't.But if I thought I'd offended her,of all people...Eve... I'm fond of Margo, too.But I know Margo. And every now and then,there is nothing I wanna do so muchas kick her right square in the pants.Well, if she has to pick on someone,I'd just as soon it was me. Max is gonna drop us. Good night. Good night. Good night.Mrs Richards? You won't forget, will you?What we talked about before?No, Eve. I won't forget.Why so remote, Addison?You should be at the side ofyour protégée, lending her moral support.Miss Caswell is where I canlend no support, moral or otherwise.In the ladies' shall we say ""lounge""?Being violently ill to her tummy.It's good luck before an audition.Miss Caswell got lucky too late.The audition is over.It can't be. I came here to readwith Miss Caswell. I promised Max.The audition was at ..It's now nearly four.Is it really? I must start wearing a watch.I never have, you know.Who read with Miss Caswell? Bill? Lloyd? No. Well, it can't have been Max. Who? Naturally, your understudy.It's unnatural to allow a girlin an advanced state of pregnancy...I refer to your new and unpregnantunderstudy, Miss Eve Harrington.Eve? My understudy? Didn'tyou know? Of course I knew.It just slipped your mind?How... was Miss Caswell?Frankly, I don't remember. Just slipped your mind? Completely.Nor can anyone else presenttell you how Miss Caswell read,or whether Miss Caswell reador rode a pogo stick.Was she that bad?Margo, I have lived in the theatreas a Trappist monk lives in his faith.I have no other world, no other life.Once in a great while,I experience that moment of revelationfor which all true believerswait and pray. You were one.Jeanne Eagels another, Paula Wessely,Hayes. There are others, three or four.Eve Harrington will be among them.I take it she read well.It wasn't a reading, it was a performance.Brilliant, vivid,something made of music and fire.How nice.In time, she'll be whatyou are.A mass of music and fire.That's me. An old kazoo with some sparklers.Tell me, was... Bill swept away too? Or were you too full of revelation to notice? Bill didn't say.But Lloyd listened to his play as ifit had been written by someone else, he said.It sounded so fresh,so new, so full of meaning.How nice for Lloyd. How nice for Eve.How nice for everybody.Eve was incredibly modest.She insisted that no credit was due her.That Lloyd felt as he did because she readhis lines exactly as he'd written them.The implication beingthat I did not read them as written?Neither your name nor your performanceentered the conversation.Feeling better, my dear?Like I just swam the English Channel.Now what?Your next move, it seems to me,should be towards television.Tell me this.Do they have auditions for television?That's all television is, my dear.Nothing but auditions.Margo, darling.Terribly sorry I was late.Lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab. Where's Miss Caswell? Oh, hello, Eve. Hello, Miss Channing.How are you making outin Mr Fabian's office?Now, Max, I don't wantyou working this childtoo hard just because you promised.As you see, I kept my promise, too.It's all over. What's all over? The audition. Eve read with Miss Caswell. Eve? How enchanting.How did you get the idea of lettingEve read with Miss Caswell? Well, she's your understudy. Eve? My understudy? I had no idea.I thoughtyou knew. She started a week ago.I've never seen her backstage, but withso many people loitering about... Well, well.So Eve is not working for Max, after all.Max, you sly puss.Miss Channing, I can't tell youhow glad I am thatyou arrived so late. Really, Eve? Why? Otherwise, I never would have dared to read. Why not? If you'd come in the middle,I couldn't have gone on.What a pity.All that fire and music being turned off. What fire and music? You wouldn't understand.How was Miss Caswell?Back to the Copacabana.But Eve, Margo. Let me tell you about Eve.I was dreadful, Miss Channing. I have no rightto be anyone's understudy, much less yours.I'm sure you underestimate yourself.You always do.You were about to tell me about Eve. You'd have been proud of her. I'm sure. She was a revelation. To you too? What do you mean by that? It must have been a revelationto have a yearold characterplayed by a yearold actress. That's beside the point. It is the point.It must have seemed so new and fresh to you,so exciting, to have your linesread just as you wrote them. Addison. So full of meaning, fire and music.You've talked to thatvenomous fishwife DeWitt.In this case, as trustworthyas the world almanac.You knew when you came inthat Eve was your understudy.Playing that childish game of cat and mouse.Not mouse. Never mouse. If anything, rat.Your genius for making a barroom brawlout of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding.Perfectly innocent?Men have been hanged for less.I'm lied to, attacked behind my back,accused of reading your playas if it were the holy gospel.I never said it was.You listen as if someone else had writtenyour play. Whom do you have in mind?Arthur Miller? Sherwood?Beaumont and Fletcher? May I say a word? No!You think Miller or Sherwood would standfor the nonsense I take from you?Stick to Beaumont and Fletcher.They've been dead for  years!All playwrights should be dead for  years!That would solve none of their problemsbecause actresses never die!The stars never die and never change.You may change this star any time you wantfor a new and fresh and exciting one,fully equipped with fire and music.Any time you want,starting with tonight's performance.This is for lawyers to talk about.This concerns a contractthat you cannot rewrite or adlib.Are you threatening mewith legal action, Mr Fabian? Are you breaking the contract? Answer my question. Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man. I don't hear you. I said I'm a dying man! Not until the last drugstorehas sold its last pill.I shall never understand the processby which a body with a voicesuddenly fancies itself as a mind.Just when does an actress decidethey're her words she's sayingand her thoughts she's expressing?Usually at the pointwhen she has to rewrite and rethinkthemto keep the audience from leaving the theatre.It's about time the piano realisedit has not written the concerto!And you, I take it, are the Paderewskiwho plays his concerto on me, the piano?Where is Princess Fire and Music? Who? The kid. Junior. Gone. I must have frightened her away.I wouldn't be surprised.Sometimes you frighten me.Poor little flower.Dropped her petals and folded her tent. Don't mix your metaphors. I'll mix what I like!I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.What a body. What a voice.That ex shipnews reporter.No body, no voice, all mind. The gong rang, the fight's over, calm down. I will not calm down.Don't calm down. You're being terribly tolerant, aren'tyou? I'm trying terribly hard.Well, you needn't be. I will not betolerated and I will not be plotted against. Here we go. Such nonsense. What do you take me for?Little Nell from the country? Been myunderstudy for a week without me knowing it. Carefully hidden, no doubt. Don't get carried away.Arrives here for an auditionwhen everyone knows I will be here, and gives a performance out of nowhere. You've been all through that with Lloyd.The playwright doesn't make theperformance. It doesn't just happen.Full of fire and music and whatnot.Carefully rehearsed, I have no doubt.Full of those Bill Sampson touches. I am tired of these paranoiac outbursts. Paranoiac?I didn't know Eve wasyour understudy until this afternoon. Tell that to Dr Freud along with the rest of it. No, I'll tell it to you for the last time.Cos you've got to stop hurting the two of usby these paranoiac tantrums. That word. I don't even know what it means. It's time you found out.I love you. I love you. You're beautiful and intelligent. A body with a voice.A beautiful and an intelligent woman,and a great actress.A great actress at the peak of her career.You have every reason for happiness. Except happiness. Every reason.But due to some uncontrollable drive,you permit the slightest action of a kid... A kid! ..a kid to turn you into a screaming harpy.Now, once and for all, stop it.It's obvious you're not a woman. I've been aware of that for some time. Well, I am.I'll say.Don't be condescending.Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.I may have seen better days, but I'mstill not to be had for the price of a cocktail.Like a salted peanut. Margo, let's make peace. The terms are too high.Just being happy? Just stoppingall this nonsense about Eve? And Eve and me? It's not nonsense.But if I tell you it is, as I just did...were you listening to me? Isn't that enough? I wish it were.Then what would be enough?If we got married?I wouldn't wantyou to marry mejust to prove something.You've had so many reasonsfor not wanting to marry me.Margo, tell me what's behind all this.I don't know, Bill.It's just a feeling. I don't know.I think you do know.But you won't or can't tell me.I said before it was gonna bemy last try, and I meant it.I can't think of anything else to do.I wish I could.We usually wind up screamingas the curtain comes down.Then it comes up again and everything's fine.But not this time.No playwright in the worldcould make me believethis would happen between two adult people.Goodbye, Margo.Bill?Where are you going?To find Eve?That suddenly makesthe whole thing believable.Lloyd. Lloyd, what's happened? Up to here, that's where I've got it.Of all the starridden,presumptuous, hysterical... Margo again. And again and again. Two hours late for the audition. That's on time for Margo.And then a childish routine aboutnot knowing Eve was her understudy. It's possible she didn't. She knew.Addison told her how superblyEve had read the part.Karen, let me tell you about Eve.She's got everything. A born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting... You'll run out of adjectives, dear.Everything a playwright first thinksof wanting to write about,until his play becomesa vehicle for Miss Channing.Margo hasn't done badly by it.Margo's great.She knows it, that's the trouble.She can play Peck's Bad Boyall she wants and who's to stop her?Who's to give her that bootin the rear she needs and deserves?It's gonna be a cosy weekend. What is? We're driving to the country tomorrow.Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I.Well, we've spent weekendsbefore with nobody talking.Just be sure to lock upall blunt instruments and throwable objects.Newton, they say, thought of gravityby getting hit on the head by an apple.And the man who invented the steamengine,he was watching a teakettle.But not me. My big idea cameto me just sitting on a couch.That boot in the rear to Margo.Heaven knows, she had one coming.From me, from Lloyd, from Eve,Bill, Max and so on.We'd allfelt those size fivesof hers often enough.But how? The answer wasbuzzing around me like a fly.I had it.But I let it go.Screaming and calling names is one thing,but this could mean...Why not? ""Why""I said to myself""not?""It would all seem perfectly legitimate.And only two people in the world would know.Also, the boot would land whereit would do the most goodfor all concerned.After all, it was no more than a harmless jokewhich Margo herselfwould be the first to enjoy.And no reason why she shouldn'tbe told about it... in time.Hello. Will you please callMiss Eve Harrington to the phone?Not at all. I'll wait.It was a cold weekend, outside and in.Bill didn't come at all.Margo didn't know where he wasand didn't care... she kept saying.Somehow we staggered through Sunday,and by the time we drove Margoto the station late Monday afternoon,she and Lloyd had thawed outto the extent of being civil to each other. What time is it? When you asked a minute ago, it was ..It is now ..When you ask again a minute from now...I just don't want Margo to miss her train.As it is, she'll barely make the theatre... We'll be at the station in plenty of time.That little place"" just two hours from New York"".It's on my list of things I'll never understand,like collecting shrunken Indian heads.You should know what it meansto want a little peace and quiet.Peace and quiet is for libraries.Lloyd. Please.Just a little skid, that's all.This road's like glass. Karen and I just don't want an accident. I don't intend to have an accident.It isn't important whether you do.We are wearing long underwear.Now what's this?But it can't be. We can't be out of gas.I filled it myself yesterday. Wasn't it fullwhen you drove to Brewster this morning?I didn't look. You knowI don't pay attention to those things.Just incredible. How much time have we got? Roughly ten minutes. Howfar is the station? About three or four miles. Any houses where we can borrow gas? There's not much along this back road.Not many cars either.Not much chance of a lift.No sense in sitting here. I'm gonnawalk up about half a mile, just in case. You want it on? It doesn't matter.I detest cheap sentiment.Karen?No, thank you. I haven't been very pleasant this weekend. We've all been a little tense lately.Come to think of it, I haven't been verypleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry.More than any two people I know, I don'twant you and Lloyd to be angry with me.We're never deeply angry.We just get mad the way you do.We know you too well.So many people know me.I wish I did.I wish someone would tell me about me.You're Margo. Just... Margo.And what is that? Besides somethingspelled out in light bulbs, I mean.Besides a temperament, which consistsmostly of swooping about on a broomstickand screaming at the top of my voice.Infants behave the way I do, you know.They carry on and misbehave.They'd get drunk if they knew how,when they can't have what they want.When they feel unwanted or insecure or...unloved. What about Bill? What about Bill?He's in love with you.More than anything in this world,I love Bill. And I want Bill.And I want him to want me.But me, not Margo Channing.And if I can't tell them apart, how can he?Well, why should he and why should you?Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He'sfought with her, worked with her, loved her.But ten years from nowMargo Channing will have ceased to exist.And what's left will be... what?Margo, Bill is all ofeight years younger than you.Those years stretch as the years go on.I've seen it happen too often.Not to you, not to Bill.Isn't that what they always say?I don't suppose the heater runsif the motor doesn't.Silly, isn't it? You'd thinkthey'd fix it sopeople could just sit in a car and keep warm.About Eve.I've acted pretty disgracefullytoward her too. Well... Don't fumble for excuses.Not here and now with my hair down.At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to...Well, to the fact that she's so young,so feminine and so helpless.To so many things I want to be for Bill.It's funny, a woman's career. The things youdrop on your way up so you can move faster.You forgetyou'll need them againwhen you get backto being a woman.That's one career all females havein common, whether we like it or not.Being a woman.Sooner or later, we've got to work at it.No matter how manyother careers we've had or wanted.And in the last analysis,nothing's any good unless you canlook up just before dinner orturn around in bed and there he is.Without that, you're not a woman.You're something with a French provincialoffice or a... a book full of clippings.But you're not a woman.Slow curtain. The end.Margo. Margo, I wantyouto know how sorry I am about this. About what? This.I can't tell you how sorry I am.Don't give it a thought.One of destiny's merry pranks.After all, you didn't personallydrain the gasoline tank yourself.Eve, of course, was superb.Many of the audience understandablypreferred to return another time to see Margo.But those who remained cheered loudly,lustily and longfor Eve.How thoughtful of her to calland invite me that afternoon.And what a happy coincidencethat several representativesof other newspapers happened to be present.All of us invited that afternoonto attend an understudy's performance,about which the management knew nothinguntil they were forcedto ring up the curtain at nine o'clock.Coincidence.You were better than all right.You rang a bell. Little thingshere and there, but it doesn't matter.Be proud of yourself. You've got a right to be.Are you proud of me, Bill?I admit I was worriedwhen Max called. I had my doubts. You shouldn't have had any doubts. After all, the other day was one scene.The woods are full of onescene sensations.But you did it. With work and patience,you'll be a good actress if that's whatyou wanna be. Is that whatyou want me to be? I'm talking aboutyou and whatyou want. So am I. What have I got to do with it? Everything.The names I've been called,but never Svengali. Good luck.Don't run away, Bill.From what would I be running?You're always after truthon the stage. What about off? I'm for it. Then face it. I have. Ever since that first night in here. I told you what every actress should know.You told me that whatever I became,it would be because of you. Makeup's a little heavy. And for you. You're quite a girl. You think? I'm in love with Margo. Hadn'tyou heard? You hear all kinds of things.I'm only human, rumours to the contrary,and I'm as curious as the next man. Find out. Only thing:what I go after I want to go after.I don't want it to come after me.Don't cry. Just score itas an incomplete forward pass.Who is it?May I come in?Certainly, Mr DeWitt.I expected to find this roomwith a theatreful of people atyour feet. I'm lucky they didn't throwthings. Your performance was no surprise to me.After the other day, I regarded itas simply a promise fulfilled.You're more than kind. But it'sstill Miss Channing's performance.I'm the carbon copy you readwhen you can't find the original. You're more than modest. It's not modesty. I don't try to kid myself.A revolutionary approach to the theatre. But if I may make a suggestion... Please do.I thinkthe time has cometo shed some of your humility.It is just as false not to blow your hornat all as it is to blow it too loudly.I don't think I've done anythingto sound off about.We come into this world with our littleegos equipped with individual horns.If we don't blowthem, who else will?Even so... one pretty good performance byan understudy, it'll be forgotten tomorrow.It needn't be.Even if I wanted to, as you say,be less humble, blow my own horn,how would I do it? I'm less than nobody. I'm somebody. You certainly are.Leave the door open a bit... so we can talk.After you change, if you're not busyelsewhere, we could have supper.I'd love to. Or should I pretend I'm busy?Let's have a minimum of pretending.I shall want to do a column aboutyou.I'm not even enough for a paragraph.Perhaps more than one. There's so muchI want to know. I've heard your story in part.Your home in Wisconsin, your tragicmarriage, your fanatical attachment to Margo.It started in San Francisco, didn't it?I say your idolatry of Margostarted in San Francisco, didn't it?That's right.San Francisco, an oasis ofcivilisation in the California desert.Tell me, do you sharemy high opinion of San Francisco?Yes, I do.And that memorable night when Margofirst dazzled you from the stage,what theatre was it in San Francisco?Was it the Shubert?Yes, the Shubert.Fine old theatre, the Shubert. Full of tradition.Untouched by the earthquake.Or should I say fire?Tell me, what was your husband's name? Eddie. Eddie what?I'm about to go into the shower.I won't be able to hear you.Well, it can wait.Where would you like to go?We must make this a special night.You take charge.I believe I will.Some morning papers carrieda squib about Eve's performance.Not much, but full of praise.I couldn't imaginehow they found out about it.But Lloyd said Max's publicity manprobably sent out the story.At any rate, lfelt terribly guiltyand ashamed of myselfand wanted nothing so muchas to forget the whole thing.Margo and I were having lunch at ,just like girlfriends... with hats on. Has Miss Channing come in? Notyet.Thank you.Eve! I've heard the most wonderfulthings aboutyour performance. Relief that I managed to stagger through it. She was magnificent. Then you've heard, too. I was there. You were at the play last night? A happy coincidence. We're having lunch with a talent scout. They certainly don't waste much time. It's nothing definite. Just lunch. They'll be wasting their time.Eve has no intention of going to Hollywood.By your smart dress,I take ityour companion is a lady? Margo. Margo lunching in public?It's a new Margo,but she's just as late as the old one.She may be later than you think.Why not read my column to pass the time? The minutes will fly like hours. Thank you, Addison.Now we must join our sunburnt eager beaver. Goodbye, Karen. Goodbye.""And so my hat which has,lo, these many seasons,become firmly rooted about my ears,is lifted to Miss Harrington.""""I am available for dancing in the streetsand shouting from the housetops.""I thought that one went out with Woollcott.Now listen to this.""Miss Harrington had much to tell andthese columns shall report her faithfullyabout the lamentable practicein our theatre of permittingmature actresses to continue playing rolesrequiring a youth and vigourof which they retain but a dim memory."" I just can't believe it. It gets better.""About the understandable reluctanceof our entrenched first ladies of the stageto encourage, shall we say,younger actresses,and Miss Harrington's unsupportedstruggle for opportunity."" I can't believe Eve said those things. In this rat race,everybody's guilty till proved innocent.One of the differences betweenthe theatre and civilisation.What gets me is how all the papers happenedto catch that particular performance.Lloyd says it's a publicity release.The witch must have sent out Indian Runners,snatching critics out of bars, steam roomsand museums or wherever they hole up.She won't get away with it.Nor will Addison DeWitt and his poison pen.If Equity or my lawyer can'tor won't do anything about it,I shall personally stuff that pathetic littlelost lamb down Mr DeWitt's ugly throat!I came as soon as I read that piece of filth.I ran all the way.Bill's here, baby.Everything's all right now.I guess at this pointI'm what the French call ""de trop"".Maybe just a little around the edges.It's Addison from start to finish.It drips with his brand of venom.Taking advantage of a kid,twisting her words,making her say what he wanted her to say. Where did you get all that information? Eve. Eve? She's been to see me.She left just before you came in.You just missed her. That was a pity. Wanted to explain about the interview.Wanted to apologise to someone,and didn't dare face Margo. I wonder why. She started talking and couldn't finish.She cried so.I've been going over our financial position,if you'll pardon the expression. That's quite a change of subject. What with taxes coming up, and,since I'm a playwright and notan oilwell operator, I was thinking...I'm trying hard to follow you.Instead of waiting until next seasonto do Footsteps on the Ceiling,which is in pretty good shape,and if Margo can be talked intogoing on tour with Aged in Wood,we could put Footstepsinto production right away. I'm beginning to catch up. If we can cast it properly, that is.Maybe get some younger actress? Someonewho'd lookthe part as well as play it? You've got to admit, it'd be a novelty. Now you're quoting Addison... or Eve.Eve did mention the play, but in passing.She'd never have the nerveto askto play a part like Cora.Eve would askAbbott to give her Costello.I got the idea myself whileshe was talking about the play. With gestures, of course. To write somethingand have it realised completely.For once, not to compromise.Lloyd Richards, do not consider givingthat contemptible little worm the part of Cora! Now just a minute... Margo's not been exactly a compromise.Playwrights everywhere wouldgive their shirts for that compromise.Now just a minute...Eve's disloyalty and ingratitudemust be contagious.All this hysteria becauseof an impulsive excited kidand a professionalmanureslinger named DeWitt. She apologised, didn't she? On her knees, I've no doubt.Very touching.Very Academy of Dramatic Arts.That bitter cynicism is somethingyou've acquired since you left Radcliffe.That cynicism I acquired the day Idiscovered I was different from little boys.Hello.Hi, Margo.No, not at all.Karen and I were just chatting.Yes, I'm sure we canand I'm sure we'd love to.Right. .ish.See you then.Margo and Bill want us to meet themat the Cub Room tonight after the theatre.Margo Channing in the Cub Room.I couldn't be more surprisedif she'd said Grant's tomb. I'm glad Bill's back. They'd die without each other.I didn't promise Eve anything.I said she'd be fine for the partbut there were practical difficulties. Such as? You, for one.I told her you wanted Margo to playthe part and I would wantyour approval.That's fine. Fine and dandy.Just refer all of Miss Eve Harrington'sfuture requests to me.The socalled art of acting is not onefor which I have a particularly high regard. Hear, hear. Butyou may quote me as follows:""Tonight Miss Margo Channing gavea performance in your cockamamie play,the like of which I have never seen beforeand expect rarely to see again."" He does not exaggerate. I was good. You were great.Quite a night. I hear your understudy,a Miss Harrington, has given her notice. Too bad. I'm broken up about it.You just can't pick upchampagne and drink it.Somebody's got to bevery witty about a toast.I shall propose the toast,without wit, with all my heart.To Margo. To my bridetobe. Glory hallelujah. Margo. Drink. When? When are you going to do it? Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at ten. And you're going to be on time. Yes, sir.City Hall, that's for prizefighters andreporters. I see a cathedral, banks of flowers...It's only for the licence.There's a threeday wait for blood tests.I'll marry you if it turns outyou have no blood at all. What are you going to wear? Something simple,a fur coat over a nightgown.The point is this. In a cathedral,a ballpark or a penny arcade,we wantyou two beside us,as our nearest and dearest friends.Which we are. Which we'll always be.There are very few moments in lifeas good as this. Let's remember it.To each of us and all of us never have we been more close.May we never be farther apart. Mrs Richards? Yes. For you. Thank you.Very indiscreet. A note in the open like that.Next time, tell your loverto blow smoke rings or tap a glass.Lloyd, I wantyou to be big about this.The world is full of love tonight.No woman is safe.Well, this beats all world's recordsfor running, jumping or standing gall.""Forgive my butting in to whatseems such a happy occasion,but it's important that I speak with you.""""Please"", and that's underlined,""meet me in the ladies' room. Eve.""I understand she's nowthe understudy in there.Hand me that empty bottle. I may find her.Well, look. There's Rasputin. More champagne, Miss Channing? That's what I said, bub. Maybe she just wants to apologise. I have no interest in anything she may say.But what could she say?That's what fascinates me. Go on, find out. Karen, in all the years of our friendship,I have never letyou goto the ladies' room alone.Now I must. I am busting to find outwhat's going on in that feverishlittle brain waiting in there.Well... all right.Karen!How nice.Very effective, but why take it out on me?I was wondering whether you'd come at all.Don't get up. And don't actas if I were the Queen Mother.I don't expectyou to be pleasant.I don't intend to be.Can't we sit down just for a minute?I've got a lot to say and none of it's easy. There can't be very much. But there is. Easy or not, I won't believe a word of it. Why should you?Please sit down.You know, I've always consideredmyself a very clever girl.Smart, good head on my shoulders,that sort of thing.Never the wrong word at the wrong time.But then I'd never metAddison DeWitt.I remember I had a tooth pulled once.They gave me some anaesthetic.I don't remember the name.It affected me strangely.I found myself saying thingsI wasn't even thinking.As if my mind was outside of my bodyand couldn't control what I did or said. And you felt like that talking to Addison? In a way.You find yourself trying to say whatyou mean, but somehowthe words change.They become his words.And suddenly you're not sayingwhat you mean, but what he means.Do you expect me to believe thatyou didn'tsay any of that? That they were all Addison?I don't expectyou to believe anything,except that the responsibilityis mine... and the disgrace.Let's not get overdramatic.You really have a low opinionof me, haven'tyou?I'll give you some pleasant news.I've been told offin no uncertain terms, all over town.Miss Channing should be happy to hear that.To know how Ioyal her friends are,how much more Ioyal thanshe had a right to expect me to be. Eve, don't cry. I'm not crying.Tell me, how did your luncheonturn out with the man from Hollywood?Some vague promises of a test. If a particularpart should come along, one of those things. But the raves aboutyour performance... An understudy's performance.Well, I think you're paintingthe picture a little blacker than it is, really.Don't underestimate him.You have a powerful friend in Addison.He's not my friend. You were my friends. He can help you. I wish I'd never met him.I'd like him to be dead.I want my friends back.Eve... I don't thinkyou meant to cause unhappiness.But you did. More to yourself perhaps,as it turned out, than to anyone else. I'll never get over it. Yes, you will.You theatre people always do.Nothing is for ever in the theatre.Whatever it is, it's here, it flares up, burns hot,and it's gone. I wish I could believe that. Give yourself time.Don't worry too muchabout what people think.You're very young and very talented.And, believe it or not,if there's anything I can do...There is something. I think I know. Something most importantyou can do.You wanna play Cora. You want meto tell Lloyd I think you should play it.If you told him so, he'd give methe part. He said he would.After all you've said. Don'tyou knowthat part was written for Margo?It might've been  years ago.It's my part now. You talk just as Addison said you did. Cora is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd. Nothing in the world will make me say that. Addison wants me to play it. Over my dead body. That won't be necessary.Addison knows how Margohappened to miss that performance,how I happened to know she'd miss itin time to notify every paper in town.It's quite a story.Addison could make quite a thing of it.Imagine how snide and vicious he could get,and still tell nothing but the truth.I had a time persuading him.You better sit down. You look a bit wobbly.If I play Cora, Addison will nevertell what happened, in or out of print.A simple exchange of favours.I'm so happy I can do somethingfor you at long last.Your friendship with Margo,your deep, close friendship.What would happen to it if she knewthecheap trick you played on her for my benefit?You and Lloyd, how long, even in the theatre,before people forgot what happenedand trusted you again?No.It would be so much easier for everyoneconcerned if I were to play Cora.So much better theatre, too.A part in a play.You'd do all that just for a part in a play?I'd do much more for a part that good.Hungry?I'm not surprised, after all that humble pie.Nothing of the kind.Karen and I had a nice talk.Heart to heart? Woman to woman?Including a casual reference to the partof Cora and your hopes of playing it?I discussed it very openly. I told her I'dspoken to Lloyd, and that he was interested.And Karen mentioned, of course,that Margo expects to play the part?Oddly enough, she didn'tsay a word about Margo.Just that she'll be happy to dowhat she can to see that I play it.Just like that?Just like that.You know, Eve, sometimesI think you keep things from me. I don't thinkthat's funny. It wasn't meant to be.I confide in you and rely on youmore than anyone I've ever known.To say a thing like that now,without any reason,when I need you more than ever.I hope you mean whatyou say.I intend to hold you to it.We have a great dealin common, it seems to me. Well, what happened? Nothing much. She apologised. With tears? With tears.But not right away. First fight them back,chin up, stout fellow. Check. Very classy. Lots of technique.You mean all this time she's donenothing but apologise? What did you say?Not much.Groom, may I have a wedding present? What would you like? Texas? I want everybody to shut up about Eve.Just shut up about Eve. That's all I want.Give Karen more wine.Never have I been so happy.Isn't it a lovely room? The Cub Room.What a lovely, clever name.Where the elite meet.Never have I seen so much elite,all with their eyes on me,waiting for me to crackthat littlegnome on the noggin with a bottle.But not tonight. I'm forgiving tonight.Even Eve. I forgive Eve.There they go.There goes Eve.Eve Evil, little Miss Evil.But ""the evil that men do...""How does that go, groom?Something about the good they leave behind.I played it once in rep in WilkesBarre.You've got it backwards,even for WilkesBarre.Do you know why I forgive Eve?She left good behind.The four of us here together it's Eve fault. I forgive her.And Bill, especially Bill. She did that too.You know, she probably means well after all. She is a louse. Never try to outguess Margo. Groom? Yes, dear. Do you know what I'm going to be? A cowboy? A married lady. With a paper to prove it.I'm going to look up at six o'clock,and there he'll be. Remember, Karen? I remember. You'll be there, won'tyou? Often enough to keep the franchise.No more makebelieve, offstage or on.Remember, Lloyd? I mean it now.Lloyd, will you promisenot to be angry with me? That depends. No, I mean deeply angry.I don't think I could be.Well, I don't want to play Cora. What? You're always so touchy about his plays.It isn't the part. It's a great partand a fine play. But not for me any more.Not for a foursquare, upright,downright, forthright, married lady. What's your being married got to do with it? It means I've finally got a life to live.I don't have to play parts I'm too old forjust because I've gotnothing to do with my nights.Lloyd, I'll make it up to you, believe me.I'll tour a year with this one, anything.Only you do understand, don'tyou? What's so funny? Nothing. Nothing? Everything. Everything's so funny.Lloyd never got around to askingwhether it was all right with mefor Eve to play Cora.Bill, oddly enough, refused to directthe play at first... with Eve in it.Lloyd and Max finally won him over.Margo never came to rehearsal.Too much to do around the house, she said.I'd never known Bill and Lloydto fight as bitterly and often,and always over some business for Eve,or a move, or the way she read a speech.But I'd never known Lloydto meddle as much with Bill's directing,as far as it affected Eve, that is.Somehow Eve kept them going.Bill stuck it out. Lloyd seemed happy.And I thought it might be bestif I skipped rehearsals from then on.It seemed to me I had known alwaysthat it would happen. And here it was.I felt helpless. That helplessness youfeel when you have no talent to offer,outside of loving your husband.How could I compete?Everything Lloyd loved about me,he'd gotten used to long ago.Hello?Who? Who's calling Mr Richards?My name wouldn't mean anything.I room across the hall from Eve Harrington.She isn't well. She's been cryingall night and she's hysterical.She doesn't want a doctor and...Who is it? What's it all about? Did Miss Harrington tell you to call? No. Eve didn't say to call him.I saw Mr Richards with her a couple of times.I thought, they being such good friends...This is Lloyd Richards.Where is Eve? Let me talkto her.Hello, Mr Richards.She's upstairs in her room.I really hate to bother you this way,but the way Eve's been feeling,I've been worried sick, what withher leaving tomorrowfor New Haven.Tell her not to worry. Tell her I'll be right over.To the theatre world,New Haven, Connecticut,is a short stretch of sidewalk betweenthe Shubert Theatre and the Taft Hotel,surrounded by what looksvery much like a small city.It is here that managers havewhat are called outoftown openings,which are openings for New Yorkerswho want to go out of town.What a day. What a heavenly day. Dday. Just like it.Tomorrow morning, you will have wonyour beachhead on the shores of immortality.Stop rehearsing your column.Isn't it strange, Addison?I thought I'd be panicstricken,want to run away or something.Instead, I can't wait for tonightto come. To come and go.Are you that sure of tomorrow? Aren'tyou? Frankly, yes.It'll be a night to remember.It'll bring me everything I've ever wanted.The end of an old road,the beginning of a new one. All paved with diamonds and gold? You know me better than that.Paved with what, then?Stars.What time?Almost four.Plenty of time for a nice, long nap.We rehearsed most of last night.You could sleep now, couldn'tyou? Why not? The mark of a true killer.Sleep tight, rest easy and come out fighting.Why did you call me a killer?Did I say killer? I meant champion.I get my boxing terms mixed.Addison, come in for a minute, will you?I've got something to tell you.Suites are for expense accounts.You're being extravagant.Max is paying for it. He and Lloydhad a terrific row, but Lloyd insisted. Can I fix you a drink? With the reluctant compliments of Max?Lloyd. I never have any.He likes a few drinks after we finish,so he sent it up.Some plain soda. Lloyd must beexpecting a record run in New Haven.That's for tonight. You're invited.We're having everyone upafter the performance.""We are""?Lloyd and I.I find it odd that Karenisn't here for the opening. Addison... She was always so devoted to Lloyd. One would think only death could keep her... Addison...I said this would be a night to remember,that it would bring me all I ever wanted.Something about an old road endingand a new one starting, all paved with stars.I didn't mean just the theatre.What else?Lloyd Richards.He's going to leave Karen.We're going to be married.So that's it. Lloyd.Still just the theatre, after all.It's nothing of the kind.Lloyd loves me. I love him.I know nothing of Lloyd's loves. I leavethose to Louisa May Alcott. But I know you. I'm in love with Lloyd. He is a commercially successful playwright. You have no right to say that. And, artistically, very promising.Eve, dear, this is Addison.Oh, Addison, won't it be just perfect?Lloyd and I.There's no telling howfar we can go.He'll write great plays for me.I'll make them great.You're the only one who knows,except Lloyd and me. And Karen. She doesn't know. She knows enough not to be here. But not all of it. Not that Lloyd and I are gonna be married. I see.And when was this unholy alliance joined?We decided night before last,before we came up here.I trust the setting was properly romantic.Lights on dimmersand gypsy violins offstage.The setting wasn't romantic,but Lloyd was.He woke me up at three o'clockin the morning, banging on my door.He couldn't sleep, he said. He'd left Karen.Couldn't go on with the play or anythingelse until I promised to marry him.We sat and talked until it was light.He never went home. You sat and talked until it was light? We sat and talked, Addison.I want a runoftheplay contract.There never was, and therenever will be, another like you.Well, say something. Anything.Congratulations. SkäI. Good work, Eve. What do you take me for? I don't knowthat I ""take you"" for anything.Is it possible thatyou've confused mewith those backward childrenyou've played tricks on?That you have the same contemptfor me as for them?I'm sure you mean something,but I don't know what.Look closely, Eve. It's time you did.I am Addison DeWitt.I'm nobody's fool, least of all yours. I never intended you to be. Yes, you did, and you still do.I don't know whatyou mean.But I want to take my nap. It's important... It's important that we talk, killer to killer. Champion to champion.Not with me, you're no champion.You're stepping up.Please say whatyou have to say, plainlyand distinctly, and then let me take my nap.Very well. Although it's unnecessary,because you know what I'm going to say.Lloyd may leave Karen,but he will not leave Karen for you. What do you mean by that? More plainly and more distinctly?I have not come to New Havento see the play, discuss your dreams,or pull the ivy from the walls of Yale.I came to tell you thatyou willnot marry Lloyd, or anyone else,because I will not permit it. What have you got to do with it? Everything.Because after tonightyou will belong to me.Belong? To you?I can't believe my ears.A dull cliché.""Belong"" to you?That sounds medieval.Something out of an old melodrama.So does the history of the worldfor the past  years.I don't enjoy putting it this bluntly.I'd hoped thatyou would havetaken it for granted thatyou and I...""Taken it for granted""?""That you and I...""?Now remember, as long as you live,never to laugh at me.At anything or anyone else, but never at me. Get out. You're too short for that gesture.Besides, it went out with Mrs Fiske.Then if you won't get out,I'll have you thrown out.Don't pick up that phone. Don't even touch it.Something told you to dowhat I said, didn't it?That instinct is worth millions.You can't buy it, Eve. Cherish it.When that alarm goes off,go to your battle stations.To begin with, your name is not EveHarrington. It's Gertrude Slescynski. What of it? True, your parents were poor, and still are.They would like to know how you are. Theyhaven't heard from you for three years.What of it?A matter of opinion, granted.It's also true you worked in a brewery. Butlife there was not as dull as you pictured it.It got less and less dull, until your boss'swife had your boss followed by detectives. She never proved a thing! But the $ you got to get out of townbrought you straight to New York, didn't it? That $ broughtyou straight to New York. She was a liar. She was a liar!Answer my question.Weren't you paid to get out of town?There was no Eddie, no pilot.You've never been married.That was not only a lie, it was an insult todead heroes and the women who loved them.San Francisco has no Shubert Theatre.You've never been to San Francisco.That was a stupid lie, easy to expose,not worthy of you.I had to get in to meet Margo. I had to saysomething, be somebody. Make her like me!She did like you. She helped and trusted you. You repaid her by trying to win Bill. That's not true!I was there. I saw you and heard youthrough the dressingroom door.You used my name to blackmail Kareninto getting you the part of Cora. You lied to me about it. No!I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago.As always with women who try to find outthings, she told more than she learnt.Now do you want to change your story aboutLloyd beating atyour door that night?Please, please.That I should wantyou at all suddenlystrikes me as the height of improbability.But that in itself is probably the reason.You're an improbable person, Eve,and so am I. We have that in common.Also a contempt for humanity,an inability to love and be loved.Insatiable ambition... and talent.We deserve each other.Are you listening to me? Then say so. Yes, Addison.And you realise and you agreehow completely you belong to me?Yes, Addison.Then take your nap,and good luck for tonight.I won't play tonight.I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on.""Couldn't go on""?You'll give the performance of your life.And she gave the performance of her life.And it was a night to remember, that night.Honoured members ofthe Sarah Siddons Society,distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.What is there for me to say?Everything wise and wittyhas long since been saidby minds more matureand talents far greater than mine.For me to thank you as equalswould be presumptuous.I am an apprentice in the theatre,and have much to learn from all of you.Let me say only that I am proud and happy,and that I regard this great honournot so much as an awardfor what I have achieved,but as a standard to hold againstwhat I have yet to accomplish.And, further, that I regard itas bestowed upon me only in part.The larger share belongsto my friends in the theatre,and to the theatre itselfwhich has given me all I have.In good conscience,I must give credit where credit is due.To Max Fabian. Dear Max.Dear sentimental, generous,courageous Max Fabian,who took a chance onan unknown, untried amateur.To my first friend in the theatre,whose kindness and graciousnessI shall never forget,Karen. Mrs Lloyd Richards.It was Karen who first brought meto one whom I'd always idolised,one who becamemy benefactress and champion.A great actress and a great woman,Margo Channing.To my director,who demanded always a little morethan my talent could provide,but who taught me patiently and well,Bill Sampson.And one without whosegreat play and faith in me,this night could never have been.How can I repay Lloyd Richards?How can I repay the many others,so many, I couldn't possibly name them all,whose help, guidance, and advicehave made this, the happiestnight of my life, possible.Although I am going to Hollywoodnext weekto make a film,do not think for a momentthat I am leaving you.How could I?My heart is here in the theatre,and , miles are too farto be away from one's heart.I'll be backto claim it... and soon.That is, if you want me back.Good night to you all,and to all, a good night.For services rendered beyond...whatever it is of duty, darling.Come on, I'm the host. I got to get homebefore my guests start stealing the liquor. Congratulations, Eve. Thank you, Karen. Congratulations, Miss Harrington. Thank you so much.Nice speech, Eve. But I wouldn't worrytoo much aboutyour heart.You can always put that awardwhere your heart ought to be.I don't suppose there's a drink left? You can have one at Max's. I don't think I'm going. Why not? Because I don't want to. I'm so happy for you, Eve. Thank you so much.Max has gone to a lot of trouble. This is goingto be an elaborate party and it's for you.No, it isn't. It's for this. It's the same thing, isn't it? Exactly.Here, take it to the party instead of me.You're being very childish. I'm tired. I want to go home. Very well. I'll drop you off.I shall go to the party alone.I have no intention of missing it. Who are you? Miss Harrington. What are you doing here? I... I guess I fell asleep.Please don't have me arrested.I didn't steal anything. You can search me. How did you get in here? I hid outside till the maid came in.She went out to get somethingand left the door open.I sneaked in and hid till she'd finished.Then I just looked around.I was afraid someone would noticethe lights were on, so I turned them off. Then I guess I fell asleep. You were just looking around? That's all. What for? You probably won't believe me. Probably not. It was for my report. What report? To whom?About how you live,what kind of clothes you wear,what kind of perfumeand books, things like that.You knowthe Eve Harrington Club thatthey have in most girls' high schools? I've heard of them. Ours was one of the first  Erasmus Hall. I'm the president. Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn.Barbara Stanwyck and Susan Hayward.Of course, they're just movie stars.You're going to Hollywood, aren'tyou?From the trunks you're packing,you must be going to stay a long time.I might.That spilled drink's gonna ruin your carpet.Maid'll fix it in the morning. I'll just clean up the mess. Don't bother. How'd you get up here from Brooklyn? Subway.How long does it take?With changing and everything,a little over an hour.It's after one now.You won't get home till all hours.I don't care if I never get home.That's the door.You rest. I'll get it.Hello. Who are you?Miss Harrington's resting, Mr DeWitt.She asked me to see who it is.Well, we won't disturb her rest.It seems Miss Harrington left her awardin the taxi cab. Will you give it to her?Tell me, how did you know my name?It's a very famous name, Mr DeWitt. And what's your name? Phoebe. Phoebe? I call myself Phoebe.And why not?Tell me, Phoebe, do you want somedayto have an award like that of your own? More than anything else in the world. Then ask Miss Harrington howto get one.Miss Harrington knows all about it.Who was it?Just a taxi driver, Miss Harrington.You leftyour award in his cab,and he brought it back.Put it on one of the trunks,will you? I wanna pack it.Sure, Miss Harrington."

A few?Let's start with the Capitol.I'll tell you all Iknow about it first,and then we'll joinone of the tours.Senate's in session today. Wemight be able to take that in.But first let's go to therotunda. It's famous for... Come on. You'll find it interesting. I'm comin'....starting with thelanding of the Pilgrims......of the spirit ofGeorge Washington.Washington is the figure withthe purple robe across his lap.The figures around himrepresent liberty and victory...and the  original states.Brumidi did most of that workwhile lying on his back...on a scaffold built fromthe floor to the dome,a distance of feet and three inches.Now, if you will follow me...How could anybody paintupside down like that?Hey, give me one of those. Hello. How are ya?Woooooooo! Hello. Come here. I wanna show you something.There's the Constitution.The Declaration of Independence.And come here.And the Bill of Rights. Know how old these Rights are? Oh, about  years.Who told you? What else do you know about them? What else?What else?Well, for instance, this wholecountry is practically founded...on these three pieces of paper.This whole country?""The right of the peopleto keep and bear arms...shall not be 'infrin'.""Infringed.It's a good thing they gotthis covered with glass.I'd be makin' circles all over it.How about some ice cream?Anything but tuttifrutti! How is chocolate? Fine.I think I like youbetter with them on. What? Your glasses.Thanks. You know,chocolate's the most popular.I read that.You know, it's interestinghow many interesting things...a person could learn if they read.I don't suppose you gota chance to read my piece.What are you talkin'? Ofcourse I read it. Twice.What did you think?I think it's the bestthing I ever read.I didn't understand one word. What didn't you understand? None of it.Here. Show me what.What's so funny? ThatI'm blind, practically?Practically blind. Practically blind? You're wonderful.I'm sorry I look funny to you.Don't be. They make youlook lovelier than ever.You sound like one ofthose ads for eyeglasses.Now, what didn't you understand?Well, like the name of it.""The YellowingDemocratic Manifesto."" Simple. To who?Whom? Who?Anyway, not to me. Well, you know what ""yellowing"" means. Not this time.Well, when a piece of papergets old, what happens to it? Throw it away? No. It turns yellow. It does? Of course. What do you know? Now, ""democratic."" You know what that means?Not Republican.Well, not exactly. It means...Well, it just means pertaining to ourform of government, which is a democracy.Oh.What's ""pertaining""?Has to do with.""Pertaining."" Nice word. All right. ""Manifesto."" I don't know. Why didn't you look it up? I did look it up. I still don't know.Well, look, when I say ""manifesto,""I mean a set of rules andprinciples and ideals and hopes...on which the UnitedStates is based.The ideas of those men whowrote that Constitution up there. So you think it's turning yellow? Yes.I think a lot of the original inspirationhas been neglected and forgotten. And that's bad. And that's bad. ""Even a... cursory... Cursory.Examination of contemporary...society in terms of the Greek...philosophy, whichdefines the whole...as a representation of its parts...sends one immediatelyto the consideration...of the individual as a citizen...and the citizen as an individual.""Well?I looked up every word.Listen.Thousands of years ago,a Greek philosopher said...that the world could only be asgood as the people who lived in it.Makes sense.So I said, you take onelook at America today...and you figure you'd better take a lookat the people in it, one by one, sort of. Yeah. That's all. That's this? Sure.Well, why didn't you say so?What's the name of thisnumber, did you say?Beethoven's SecondSymphony, Opus .I didn't ask you who made it up.I just asked youwhat's the name of it. Here. Wait a minute. Huh? There. Thanks. I can't get over it. Music that bad?The music? No, it was swell.Well, then what?I got a lettertoday from my father. New York? Yeah. I can't get over it. Why?Well, it's the first time he everwrote me in about eight years.We had a fight, sort of.He didn't want me to go with Harry.What does he do? My father? Yeah.Gas company. Heused to read meters.But in this letter, it says how hecan't get around so good anymore,so they gave him adifferent job, elevator man.He's a goofy old guy.He used to take a little fryingpan and a can of Sterno...to work every morningand cook his own lunch.He said everybodyshould have a hot lunch.I swear, I don'tknow how he did it.There were four of us...me and my three brothers.He had to do everything.My mother died. I never knew her.He used to feed us and give usour baths and buy our clothes.Everything...That's why all mylife, I used to think...how someday I'dlike to pay him back.It's funny how it worked out.One night I brought home$ and gave it to him.You know what he did?Well, it sure didn'tdo the plumbing no good.I thought he was gonnahit me sure, but he didn't.His whole life henever hit me once.How'd he happen to write you?I mean, after all this time? Oh, 'cause I wrote him. Oh?He says he's thoughtabout me every day.Oh, gosh.I haven't thought about him maybebut once, even in five years.Oh, that's nothing against him.I haven't thought of anything.Be nice to see him, maybe.I guess so.He says I should write him again...and I should have ahot lunch every day...and I should let him know how I am.But he doesn't want to see me...if I'm still livingin any way unethical.I looked it up.He always used to say, ""Never donothin' you wouldn't want printed...on the front page ofthe New York Times.""Hey, I just realized...I practically told you the wholestory of my life by now, practically.I enjoyed it very much.How about the story of your life?Oh, no. Much too long.And mostly untrue.Hey, this is even more gorgeous...than the Radio CityMusic Hall, even.And you notice, it smells nice.It does. Come on. Sit down. No.You're tired.I'm not a bit tired.See?You know that little thingyou gave me about Napoleon? No. What? By Robert G. Ingersoll. Oh, yes. Well, I'm not sure I get that. Well, there's no deep meaning there. There must be.He says about how he goes andlooks in Napoleon's tomb... Yeah? And he thinks of Napoleon's whole sad life. Yeah. And then in the end,he says he himself would'verather been a happy farmer.""And I said...I said I would rather have been aFrench peasant and worn wooden shoes.I would rather havelived in a hut...with a vine growingover the door...and the grapes growing purple...in the kisses of the autumn sun.I would rather havebeen that poor peasant...with my loving wife by my side...knitting as the daydied out of the sky,with my children upon myknee and their arms about me.I would rather havebeen that man...and gone down to the tonguelesssilence of the dreamless dust...than to have been that imperialimpersonation of force and murder...known as Napoleon the Great.""How do you remember all that stuff?So he'd rather been a happypeasant than Napoleon. So who wouldn't? So Harry wouldn't, for one. What makes you think that? Ask him.He probably neverheard of Napoleon.What's worse, he probablynever heard of a peasant. Do you hate him like poison? Who, Harry? Yeah. No. You don't like him. No. On account of me and him? One reason. There are lots more. What?Think about it, Billie.You'll see Harry's a menace.Oh, he's not so bad. I seen worse.Has he ever thoughtof anyone but himself? Who does? Millions of people, Billie.The whole history ofthe world is a story...of the struggle between theselfish and the unselfish. I can hear you. All that's bad around us is bred by selfishness.Sometimes selfishness caneven get to be a cause,an organized force,even a government.And then it's called fascism. Can you understand that? Sort of.Well, think about it.You're crazy about me, aren't ya? Yes. That's why you get so mad at Harry.Listen, I hate his life, what hedoes, what he stands for, not him.He just doesn't know any better.I go for you too.I'm glad of it.Ooh!""I have sworn uponthe altar of God...eternal hostility againstevery form of tyranny...over the mind of man."" So that's Thomas Jefferson, huh? Uhhuh.You know, I heardquite a bit about him.I mean, even beforeI hit town, even.Come in.What are you trying to dowith those books, hatch 'em?Blue?Nice, huh?""Beethoven, Op. .""What's up, Billie?It's all on account of youI started doin' all this. I guess you know. No, I didn't.A lot of good it did me.I never had this kind oftrouble before, I can tell you. Trouble? Sure.After that firstnight when I met ya,I figured everythingwas gonna work out dandy.Then when you wouldn't...step across the line,I figured maybe the way toyou is through your head.Well, no.Well, anyway, what's the diff now?Difference. But I like ya, anyway. It's too late for the rest. Why?Why? Oh, look, Paul.There's a certain time between a fellaand a girl when it either comes off or not.If it doesn't then,then it never does.Maybe we haven'tgot to our time yet.I think we did, andyou dropped the ball.Don't be so sure.I never thought I'd go througha thing like this for anybody. Like what? Like gettin' all mixed up in my head...like wondering and worryingand thinking, stuff like that.Last night, I went tobed. I started to think.I couldn't fallasleep for  minutes.I never know if it's goodto find out so much so quick.Nobody's born smart, Billie.You know what the stupidestthing on Earth is? An infant! What do ya got against babies all of the sudden? Nothing.I got nothing against a brainthat's three weeks old and empty.But after it hangs around for years and hasn't absorbed anything, I begin to wonder about it. What makes you think I'm ? I didn't mean you. Oh, yes, you did! I swear it. You certainly know how to get me sore! I'm sorry. Thirty! Do I look  to you? No. I don't know. Then why'd you say it for? How old are you? Twentynine.Don't stop it. I meant,don't stop studying.Will ya?I don't know why it'sso important to you.It's sort of a cause. Iwant everybody to be smart.I want 'em to be assmart as they can be.A world full of ignorant peopleis too dangerous to live in.I know. That's why Iwish I was doin' better. You're doing wonderfully. It's no use.Most people would just laugh at meif they knew what I was trying to do. I'm not laughing. I am.I started laughing at myself.Who do I think I am anyway? Once in a while, just for a change. Don't try so hard, Billie, please! You miss the whole point. I like to like what's better to like.There's room for allsorts of things in you.The idea of learning isto be bigger, not smaller. You think Fm gettin' bigger? Yes.Glad to hear it. But all them books? It's not only books, Billie. I told you a hundred times. It's mostly.It is not. Now look, who said this:""The proper studyof mankind is man."" I don't know. You should. Why? I told you. I forgot. Pope. The pope? Not the pope.Alexander Pope. ""The proper study""... ""Of mankind is man.""""Of mankind is man."" 'Course, that means women too. Yes.Yes, I know.I've been doin' some studyin'of a different mankind lately,like the ones you told me...Thomas Jefferson last week...and this week, Tom Paine.And all by myself, I gotto thinkin' about Harry.He works so hard to getwhat he wants, for instance.But he doesn't know what he wants.More of what he's got, probably. Money. Money, more people to push around, more money.Oh, he's not so badas you think he is.Hello.Hello, Harry. We werejust talking about you.Yeah? That ain'twhat I pay you for.She knows enough about mealready. Too much, in fact. Jim phone? No.I had a date with him. What'd you find out about Torn Paine? Oh, he was quite a fella. Where was he born? Do you remember? London, or England. Someplace like that. What do you mean, ""London or England""? That's the same thing. It is?London is in England. London's acity. England's a whole country. I forgot. Oh, brother, you've got patience. Take it easy. How can anybody get to be so dumb?Well, we can't allknow everything, Harry.Who's Tom Paine, for instance? What? You heard me, Tom Paine. What do I care who he is? I know.So what. If I wanted to know whohe is, I'd know. I just don't care.Go on, go on. Don't let me butt in.Which of his booksdid you like best?Oh, well, I didn't readby him yet, only about him. But I made a list. Who is Rabbit Maranville? Who? Rabbit Maranville. I don't know any Rabbits! Think you're so smart, huh?He used to play shortstopfor the Braves, didn't he?What are you, some kindof genius or something? No. I hire and fire geniuses every day. I'm sure you do. Where's the list? Here.Well, suppose you startwith The Age of Reason. The Age of Reason? Mmhmm. Then next... Who's Willie Hoppe? National billiard champion. And it's pronounced ""hoppy."" That's what I said. But I didn't ask you, I asked her. Sorry. Where were we? The Age of Reason.Yes. Next, The Rights of Man. The Rights of Man. I think that'll... What's a peninsula? Shh!Don't give me that ""shh.""You think you're so smart. What's a peninsula? Not you, her. It's a...It's that new medicine.It is not.What then?It's a body of land surroundedon three sides by water.So, what's that to know?So, what's that""Sam Paine"" to know?There's some difference between...Tom Paine, not ""Sam Paine.""Tom Paine practicallystarted this whole country. You mean he's dead? Of course.What are you learnin'her about dead people for?All I want you to do is to teachher how to act with live people.Well, education is a difficultthing to control, Harry. One thing leads to... Work on her, not me. No extra charge. I don't need nothin' you can tell me.Oh, I'm sure we could tell each othersome very interesting things, Harry. What's the idea of that mean? Just trying to be friendly.Who asked you?You know, the more I see ofyou, I don't like you as much.For a chump who got noplace, you're awful fresh.Now, you better watchout. I got my eye on you.All right. We'll both watch out.If I wanted, I could knockyour block off, if I wanted. Yes, I know. All right, just do what you'resupposed to do, and that's all. Well, we'll stop for now. No, go on, go on. I wanna see how you do it. Not just now, if you don't mind.I've gotta go and lie down. Youdon't realize how hard I work.Ha, ha. Some joke.Two hundred bucks a week,and I can't even watch.Take you on separately,Harry. Glad to.Got a special course forbackward millionaires.""London or England.""Why don't you give up. Harry? What?What's this business we're indown here? Could you tell me?What do you mean, 'we'?Oh, I figure I'm a sortof partner, in a way. A silent partner. So?So shut up! I got a right to know. You got a right to keep out of my hair too.Put your nose in thebook and keep it there!I don't wanna do anythingif it's against the law. That's one sure thing. You'll do what I tell ya!I think I know what itis, only I'm not sure.What's the matter with you?You're doin' all right, ain't ya?Somethin' you wantyou ain't got, maybe? Yeah. What?I wanna be like the happy peasant.All right, I'll buy it for you.Now, will you quit crabbin'!Well, I finished finally. Thanks loads for the loan of it. How'd you like it, Helen?Uh, not me. I don'tgo for these stories...where everyone has a bigbeef against the world.Me, I like to lookon the cheerful side.Yeah, well you seeof course the point...All right! All right!Can the coffee klatch! You, knock off! Sorry, Mr. Brock.You don't have to getso pally with everybody. Paul says it's all right. Never mind, Paul says. I don't like it. You know what you are? What? Antisocial! You can say that again. Hello. Where do you guys think you've been? You know what time it is? Sorry. You're always sorry. My fault. How do you do? How do you do? How are ya, Billie? Superb. A new word. All right! All right! What happened! It's just this, Harry. It may take a little more time. And a little more money. Yeah. Why more? Well, the amendment has to be redrafted.Listen, I don't like you. You makeme feel like some kind of sucker. I'm sure Norval is doing his best. His best ain't good enough.Don't be unreasonable, Harry. Thereare a great number of votes up there. Norval is just one guy. Well, he's the wrong guy.I'm sick and tired of waiting.Let's get the wheels rollin'.We're all in this deal. You pull yourweight or I'll get somebody who can!Do you hear me? Good! Quite a temper, hasn't he? Don't mind him.He's always lived atthe top of his voice.So long, Norval.Psst. Psst.I don't think Harry shouldtalk to you like that. After all, you're a congressman. Oh, well.I don't think anybody should talk toa congressman like that or be able to.A member of Congressis a wonderful thing.Thank you. You know, Ithink I could use a drink.Oh, sure, Congressman. Come on in.The way it looks to me,if he pushes you around...it's like he's pushing afew million people around. How do you mean? The ones who picked you. Well, not quite that many. How many then?,.Well, that's quitea few to push around.You're not one of my constituentsby any chance, are you?I mean, are you one of thepeople who voted for me?Oh, I never voted for anybody. Why not? I don't know. I wouldn't know how, I guess.It's simple. Youjust press a button.Yeah, but which one?Well, you listen to the speeches,you make up your own mind.That's all there is to it.Yeah, but why do you take it fromHarry? That's what I wanna know.You're more important thanhim. You're a congressman.Yes, and as such I havea great many duties...and responsibilities and...The operation of governmentis very complex.Why should it be?I understand it pretty good ina book so when Paul tells me.But when I see somethin' likethis happen, it's like, different. How? Well, when it gets down towhat should be the laws and...what shouldn't, is Harry moreimportant than anybody else? No. Then how come he's got so much to say?Who ever voted for him?Well, we'll have a nicelong talk about it sometime.All right. Goodbye. Goodbye.And thank you. Quite a little girl. Oh, yeah. Billie? Come in.Uh, will you come inside?A few things for you.Sign those, will ya, honey? What is this? Same old stuff. What? Take too long to explain.No, it wouldn't. I likehaving things explained to me.I found that out. Some other time. Now.It's just an agreementabout some merger.Merger? What's that?Several companiesbeing formed into one. All Harry's? No. Whose then? A few of Harry's and some others.French, Italian, and so on.A cartel! What are you talking about? About cartels!If that's what it is, I'm againstit. Paul explained me the whole thing.It's perfectly allright. Don't worry. Are you sure? Ask Harry. I will. He won't like it. Why not? Well, he just won't, that's all. He doesn't like people butting in. I'm not people.Listen to me, Billie. Be smart.How can I be smart if nobodyever tells me anything? I'm telling you something. What?Sign this stuff anddon't start up with him. Tomorrow. Why tomorrow?I wanna look it over,know what I'm doin'. It's all right. It must be somethin' fishy.If not, you'd tell me.Take my word for it.No.I know what you feel bad about.You don't like to bedoin' all his dirty work... 'cause you know you're better than him. That's enough!But I'm not so sure.Maybe you're worse.Interesting?Not very.I suppose you're used toreading more hightone stuff.Yes, I am. What's the matter, kid? Nothin'. All of a sudden... I don't like that Jim.Why? What'd he do to ya? He didn't do nothin'... anything to me. It's what he's done to himself. Done what?Paul told me he could've beenassistant attorney general...of the whole United States. Who? Jim. So what's wrong with that? So nothing's wrong with it.Look at him now. Hangsaround, helps you... promote.Lets you walk over him'cause you pay him for it.Oh, so we finally get around to me.I'm not sure I like you either.You're selfish.That's your trouble. Since when is all this? Since now.I used to think youwere a big man, Harry.I'm beginning to see you're not.All through history there's beenbigger men than you, and better. Now too. Who, for instance? Thousands. Name one.My father.Twentyfive a week.Listen, cutie, don't get nervousjust 'cause you read a book. You're as dumb as you ever were. You think so, huh?Yeah, but I don'tmind. You know why? 'Cause you're the greatest... Oh, leave me alone! Come here! I've never seen you like this! No!I've never been like this!I feel like I wanna go away! Where? In a couple of weeks we'll go to Florida. I don't know! I mean alone! Maybe! I think you've gone nuts! All right! Calm down! I can't! Why not? I don't know!I just know I hate my life.There's a better cut. I know it.And if you read some of thesebooks, you'd know it too.Maybe it's right whatyou say: I'm still dumb.But I know one thingI never knew before.There's a better kind oflife than the one I got.Or you!I suppose you'd think you'd be betteroff with that lousy saxophone player? At least he was honest! Nah, he was a dimeadozen chump!He worked for a living!That's one thing!I've worked since I was !Nobody never gave me nothin'!If a man goes and robsa house, that's work too.In my whole life...In my whole life, Inever robbed a house! What are you talking about? You can hardly understand anything.Get off that high horse,you dumb little putt!You... menace!I picked you up out of thegutter! I can throw you back!You never had a decentmeal until you met me!Yeah, but I haven't had onewith you! You eat terrible!You got no manners! Takingyour shoes off all the time.That's another thing,and picking your teeth.You're just not couth!I'm as couth as you are!And that cheap perfumeyou put on yourself.Cheap. I don't ownnothin' cheap, except you.You don't own me.Nobody can own anybody.There's a law that says.What do I care what the lawsays! If I was scared of the law, I wouldn't be where I am! Where are ya?You talked enough! Youdon't like it here, beat it!Wait a minute! First, this! Right now! Not now! No! Come here! I'm not signin' anythingtill I know what I'm signin'... from now on! Do what I'm tellin' ya! Harry, please don't! No!No!Here!All right, now go on. Blow! What? I don't want you bawlin'around here. That's what!I've been too good to ya.You don't appreciate nothin'!So go on, blow! Sit on a parkbench and learn how to behave!Go on, beat it!This way out. I gotta put somethin' on. Well, hurry it up.I don't want you around herelike this. You bother me!Big fascist!All set?Certainly, all set. What do youthink? I'm gonna let a broad talk back? Where is she? I told her to take a walk.One thing I can't stand is a crier. What's she crying about? How do I know? She's becoming a strange girl. Aw, she's all right.It's just all these books, theygot her nervous, that's all.It looks like your passion foreducating her was a mistake.I didn't know it was gonnaturn out like this, did I?Remind me to fire thatthatfoureyed Verrall skunk. Why blame him? He taught her too much. You know what she called me before? A fascist! She did?That don't make sense. I wasborn in Plainfield, New Jersey.She knows that.What's the matter, Harry?I love that broad.Hey, you think we could findsomebody to make her dumb again?And don't be late if youdon't want no bloody nose.Would you do me a favor, Harry? What? Drop dead.I have sworn uponthe altar of God...Eternal hostility...against every form of tyranny...over the mind of man.Oh, hello? Uh, Chestnut .I'd like to speak toThomas Jefferson, please.Oh, no. I mean, Thomas Verrall.No, Paul Verrall. Paul Verrall.Well, it's very important.Oh, well, I'll hold on. Jim! Yes? What time is it already? :.I'll slug her senselesswhen she gets back. If. Oh, I've had this with her before.She always windsup where I want her.I hope so. Jim! Yes?What time is it? :. You said that before.:. She's been gone eight hours. Maybe she's seeing a double feature.Yeah.That don't take eight hours. Could've got in an accident. You'd hear.Could've got attacked. Happens all the time. Not to Billie.Maybe the other wayaround, but not to Billie. She here? What do you mean, she here? No! Go look some more. I've been all over town.Well, go over it again! Do what I'm tellin' ya! Sure.Just changin' my socks. Harry. What?Marry her. Still harpin', huh? I'm thinking of your legal safety. On paper, she owns... Yeah, I know what she owns.You've got to do it, Harry.They always hook youin the end, them broads.This whole trouble is onaccount of a dame reads a book.It's the new world, Harry.Force and reason changing places. What? Knowledge is power.I don't like the way thingsare goin' around here...you stewed all the timeand that broad out of line.And that's some finecongressman you bought me. I think he's cute. Yeah, well I'd like to trade him in, no kiddin'. On what, for instance? For instance, on a senator.On a senator.Take those blinders off, Harry,and let in a little light.Just for a second.It won't hurt much.You don't go around thistown buying up senators...and congressmen as ifthey wore price tags.These guys are honest,sincerely trying to do a job.Once in a while, you finda rotten apple, like Hedges.Then you can have them,but just once in a while,in a great while.Are you sure you're ringin'Mr. Brock's suite, Operator?How about the bedroom?Well, ring a few moretimes, will ya, honey? I wanna make sure. He's not in.Just one more ring.Let's go. The stuffs in his briefcase... Uhhuh. In his bedroom. Uhhuh. I probably won't see ya again, Paul. Uhhuh. So I wanna say goodbye. What? And thanks for everything. Where are you going?Just away from here,that's all I know.Where? You can tell me. I don't know.I thought I might go seemy father for a while. I've got a better idea. What?Let's get married.You must be daffy.I love you, Billie.You don't love me.You just love my brain.That too.Well, I'll think it over,but I can tell you now...the answer's no.What are you doin'?Well, if you don't know,I must be doing it wrong.Fine time! Hello, Harry. Where ya been?I took a walk like you told me.I met Paul.Okay, buster, knock off!Good night, Paul.Good night, Billie.Good night, Harry.What's the matter,Harry, ya miss me?I decided somethin' to tell ya, somethin'good. I don't like to wait when I get an idea. Yeah, I know. Now that I see ya,I'm not so sure I should tell it. Why not? Runnin' out, talkin' fresh, slammin' doors.I knew you'd be back though. Ya did, huh? I told Jim. He was worried, not me. Not yet. What took ya so long? I had a lot to think. For instance? Just where I stand around here. I've been tryin' to tell ya. What? Where ya stand around here. Uhhuh. First, that Verrall stuff isout. It gets in my way.I don't like to see youupset. It's bad for you. The next thing, we're gonna be married. No.But you gotta learn howto behave your... No? What do you mean, no? I don't wanna.That's what I mean. No!In fact, I've neverbeen so insulted.Who are you to say no if I tell ya?Don't knock yourself out. Yougot a lot of surprises comin'.Look! Just tell me first. What? How can you not wanna marry me?Well, for one thing,you're too dumb.I just got a different kind oflife in mind, Harry, entirely.I'm sorry, but youjust wouldn't fit in.Listen, Billie, I don't understandwhat's happenin' around here. I do. What did I do? What did I?All right, I talk roughto you once in a while.Maybe I hit you acouple of times... easy.Is that any reasonto treat me like this?I done good for you too.Couldn't we straighten this out? No. Why not?Well, all that stuffI've been studying...what Paul's been tellin'me, it just mixed me up.But when you hit mebefore, it was like...everything knocked itselftogether in my head and made sense.All of the sudden Irealized what it means,how some people are alwaysgivin' and some takin'.And it's not fair,so I'm not gonna let yaanymore, or anybody else.Listen, kid, I got an idea.Ya wanna come to Florida?We used to have some goodtimes together. Remember, honey?I think you shouldmarry me, don't you?Look, Billie, I want you to marryme. I don't wanna argue about it.I heard enough. Do what I'm tellin'ya or you'll be good and sorry!I'm not scared of ya anymore,Harry. That's another thing.Oh, you're not, huh?Hit somethin' else. I'm leavin'. What? For good.Let's get organized around here!You just can't walk out, cutie!You're in this too deep! I'm in themiddle of the biggest thing I ever done!Maybe I was wrong hookin'ya in, but you're in! I'm not gonna be, I decided. All right, fine! You wanna wash it up?All right, we'll wash it up. Yeah.I'm too important to monkeyaround with what you think!Jim! Jim, wake up! Jim! What is it?Come on! You got some work to do!All right. Be right with you.Okay, well, get a move on!I'll fix it so you'reout of here in no time!I spoiled ya! I was gonnamake ya real partners!You don't want it? Fine! Let'ssee how you do without me!And you don't look like you lookednine years ago. In fact, you look lousy.If you want the truth, I'llbe glad to be rid of ya!And as far as I'm concerned, Yeah? ""vice versa.""Oh.You're back. All set? Shut up!What's the matter?She's goin' off! We're gonna settlethings and get her out of here! You sure you know what you're doing? First time in my life I do. Where's that stuff you wanted her to sign? In your bedroom. Well, come on! No!What do you mean, no?I mean... Uh, take theshortcut. The sooner, the better.They're in the bottom drawer. Blue covers? Yeah. Three copies? That's right.Paul took them. When? Just now. What for? What do you think for?To get put in thenewspapers, I guess. Some kind of jokes I don't like. It's no joke.Paul said it's thebiggest swindle since...the tea pots, somethin' like that.What are you gettin'so white about?You told me yourself itwas perfectly all right. Why, you doublecrossin' little... I don't see it like that!If there's a fire and I call theengine, so who am I doublecrossin'?The fire?We're in trouble, Harry.If this stuff breaks, nobody will play with us. What's to do?It might be best under thecircumstances to call it off. What? Let him publish. If nothinghappens, he looks silly.I've been here two months! I'vespent I don't know how much dough.I'm supposed to let all that ride? You don't want to play it safe? I want what I came after! It's gonna be tough. Because some little weasel gets noisy? I'll cut his tongue out! You're chicken! Yes think so? Yes, I think so. You're off the handle because...it looks like I've beenright and you've been wrong!Shut up! I'll handle this.All right.Lookin' for someone? Billie. Come on in. Billie! Gee, I'm tired. I was down... I think you've got somethin'by mistake belongs to me. That so?How 'bout it?Hey.Sit down. Hello. How you been? Fine. And you? Fine. Go around to his place and get the stuff. It's not there, Jim.Where then?You wanna play rough?I know how to do that too.Listen, you two heels. I makebusiness. I got too much at stake here.You've got somethin'that belongs to me.If you want out of herealive, you better give it back. I'm no blowhard! Tell him! He's no blowhard.He's had people killed before. About six years ago, there was this guy... Shut up!You ain't gonna be tellin'nobody nothin' pretty soon. Double negative, right?

Lieutenant Manion. Ηello there. Hi, Manny. Hello, Laura.Uh, Mrs. Manion, l wonder if you could meet medown at my office about : this afternoon.lt's  West Barnham. Of course. Fine. ls there anything l can get you, hon? l'm all right, hon.Right in here.""Wanted."" The big ten.They got the ten bestdressed dames...the ten top teams, the ten top tunes...and now, the ten most wanted.Well, don't knock it. That's the American dream.Those boys made the grade.You were the... district attorneyaround here, weren't you?Mmhmm. Ten years.What's your experience as a defense lawyer?Not very much.Ηow do l know you can handle my case?Well, l guess you don't know.Shall we talk about it?l suppose so.Well, now, come on, Lieutenant.Don't be so bored.You know, it might very well bethat no lawyer can handle your case...if you mean getting off scotfree.You seem to be forgettingBarney Quill raped my wife.l have the unwritten law on my side.The unwritten law is a myth, Lieutenant.There is no such thing as the unwritten law...and anyone who commits a murderon the theory that it does exist...has just bought himselfroom and board in the state penitentiary.Maybe for life.Now, with that in mind...perhaps we can proceed with a few questionsand answers that  that, uh Can l borrow your lighter?We can proceed with a few questions and answersthat might be of some help in your defense.But probably won't be.Yeah. Nice lighter. Okay. Well, how old are you? Twentyeight. How long have you been in the service?Since '. You seen any action? Korea. Have any decorations? Plenty.ls this your first marriage?No.You're not on the witness stand.You don't have to answer yes or no.Just give me the matrimonial rundown. ls this necessary? l'll be the judge of that.My first wife divorced me.Charged cruelty.Eating crackers in bed.You know, the usual stuff.Truth was, she found another guywhen l was in Korea.l met Laura four years ago in Georgia.We were married right after her divorce.Did you know the husband? He was in my outfit down there. You mean you were buddies?l'll withdraw the question.That's a little oldfashioned.Ηave there been any children by or fromany of these marriages? No. Any present prospects?Not unless Barney Quill started something.What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?War souvenir. Luger. The police have it now.l suppose you've read the newspapers,the stories about your case? Some of them. Are they substantially correct?Yes.And you didn't see Quillrape and beat your wife?No. No.When she got back, uh, to the trailer,she told me what had happened.Then how long was itbefore you went over to Quill's and killed him?l don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.That long, huh?Now, the newspapers say that your wifevolunteered to take a lie detector test.You know anything about this?Only what l read and what she told me.Do you know howthe lie detector test turned out? They didn't tell her. Yes, Sulo?Polly, we got lunch served for the jail.You want to eat with us?Does your sister still cook for the jail? Oh, sure. She cooks. Uhhuh.Well, you give her my compliments, Sulo. l've got a luncheon date downtown. Nice going, Mr. Biegler. l'll be back after lunch. Look, uh...l'm sorry if l offended you a while ago.No, you're not.Come on, bucko.Thank you.Pass the salt, Polly.Thank you.Did you give the lieutenantthe wellknown lecture?lf you mean did l coach himinto a phony story, no.Maybe you're too pure, Paul.Too pure for the natural impurities of the law.Could be that you owe the lieutenanta chance to find a defense.Could also be that you mightguide him a little...show him the way,and let him decide if he wants to take it. Want some salt? No. l'm not ready.Anyway, l'm not the right lawyerfor this fellow.Ηe's insolent, hostile.You don't have to love him. Just defend him.What's the matter? Don't you need a fee?You know something?l think you might be a little bit afraid. Afraid of what? That you might get licked.You know, there's only one thing more deviousthan a Philadelphia lawyer...and that's an lrish lawyer.Pass the salt.Put it down. Put it down. Ηello there. l usually answer to the name Paul.Are we gonna have some more jokes?Not unless you want to be the comic.Oh.l brought you some cigarettes. Oh, thanks. Peace? Oh, sure. Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...there are four ways l can defend murder.Number one, it wasn't murder.lt was suicide or accidental.Number two, you didn't do it.Number three, you were legally justified...like the protection of your homeor selfdefense.Number four, the killing was excusable.Where do l fit into this rosy picture?l'll tell you where you don't fit.You don't fit in any of the first three.Why? Why wouldn't l be legally justifiedin killing the man who raped my wife?Time element.lf you'd caught him in the act,the shooting might have been justified...but you didn't catch him in the act.You had time to bring in the police,and you didn't do that either.You're guilty of murder,premeditated and with vengeance.That's firstdegree murder in any court of law.Are you telling me to plead guilty?When l advise you to cop out, you'll know. ""Cop out""? That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.Well, if you're not telling me to cop out,what are you telling me to do?l'm not telling you to do anything.l just want you to understandthe letter of the law. Go on. Go on with what?Whatever it is you're getting at.You know, you're very bright, Lieutenant.Now let's see how really bright you can be.Well... l'm working at it.All right. Because your wife was raped...you'll have a favorable atmospherein the courtroom.The sympathy will be with you,if all the facts are true.What you need is a legal peg so that the jurycan hang up their sympathy in your behalf. You follow me? Mmhmm.What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?What's your legal excusefor killing Barney Quill?Not justification, huh?Not justification.Excuse.JJust excuse.What excuses are there?How should l know?You're the one that plugged Quill. l must've been mad. How's that?l said l must've been mad.No, a bad temper's no excuse.Well, l mean, uh, l  l must've been crazy.Am l getting warmer? Okay, Sulo. Paul?Am l getting warmer?Well, l'll tell you thatafter l talk to your wife.ln the meantime, see if you can rememberjust how crazy you were.Mrs. Manion here yet? She's been waiting quite a while.She's been through all your albumsfrom Dixieland to Brubeck. What do you think of her? Soft, easy.The kind men like to take advantage of and do. Did you get any money? Huh? Money. Oh. Oh, no.l haven't decided to take the case yet.You know, you surprise me sometimes.Why? l've been around.Yeah, well  Hi.Hi.l, uh l hope you don't mind.l think we'd better talk.You're a funny kind of a lawyer. The music, l mean. Aren't lawyers supposed to like music?Well, not that kind of music.Well, l guess that settles it.l'm a funny kind of lawyer.Where's your home, Mrs. Manion?Where'd you go to school? Where'd you live when you were growing up? Oh, no place in particular.We sort of moved around.My father was a boomer  construction boomer.Building dams, mostly.You can call me Laura. ls your family still alive, Laura? No.l don't know.l have some cigarettes around here someplace. Do you want a cigarette? No, l wanted to offer you one. You could light it for me. Oh, yes.Ηere. That's just like your husband's, isn't it? Mmhmm.Ηe gave me this because l liked the one he had.He's like that.Ηe gives me presents all the time.Do you have a happy marriage?Yes.What went wrong with the first marriage?Well, what went wrong is when l went for Manny.Well, that's honest enough.lt was more than just that.Like l told you, l grew up on the move...and Jack  that was my first husband Jack didn't like to move. He wouldn't eventake a transfer when he had the chance.l was really bored.Manny likes to go.We're always going, whenever we get the chance.We've been all over. l'm thirsty.Water? Or would a beer do?l think a beer would do fine.Maida, bring me a bottle of beer,will you? Are you married? No.That's nice.What do you do alonein this house if you aren't married?Well, it's a family home.l'm the last of the family. There you are. Thank you. Aren't you having one? No, not right now. Thanks.There you are.Oh, could Muff have a little?ln that ashtray, maybe. He loves beer. You want a beer for the dog? Mmhmm.Well, here we are.Ηe'll go to sleep now. lsn't he cute? Yeah.Well, how about it? Are you ready?l mean, are you ready to tell me the story?l know what you mean.Yeah. Well, now, suppose you tell meeverything you told the state police...plus everything you didn'ttell the state police. Where shall l begin? What time did you leave for Quill's bar?Right after dinner. About :, l guess.Manny was late getting homefrom the firing range...so we had dinnerand he laid down and went to sleep.l hadn't been out ofthe trailer almost all day...so l took Muff and a flashlightand walked over to the bar.l bought a drinkand played the pinball machine.Many people in the bar?Not many. Barney came overand challenged me to a game. For drinks, you know. How well did you know Barney?Well, he owned this barwhere Manny and l went sometimes. That's all. Had he ever made a pass at you? No. Nothing like that at all.Was he drinking heavily that night?He didn't seem to be.At least not when we were playing pinball.Were you with himthe whole time you were there?Oh, no. There were other people playing too.What time did you leave the bar?, l guess.l left by the side door.Muff was carrying the flashlight.Ηe carries it in his mouth.Ηe's so cute running along aheadwith the light shining. Was he sober? Muff? Of course he was sober.Oh, you're joking now, aren't you?Yes, l'm joking. Uh, go on.Well, Barney came from somewhere.Not the door l left by.And he said he was going my wayand he could drive me home.Ηe said the bears had been prowling aroundthat night, and l oughtn't to walk home.The bears come out of the woodsat night to scavenge.Yeah, but they're harmless enough,aren't they?Yeah. l suppose l wouldn't havebeen afraid in the daylight...but, well, the dark isn't the same, you know.Yes, l know. l know.Now, you got into Barney's car.l got in and he drovestraight to the trailer park.Ηe made overtures?No, nothing.When we got to the trailer park...the auto gate was closed.Mr. Lemon closes it or a little after.So l thanked Barneyand started to get out of the car...but he said that there wasn'tany need for me to walk...that he could drive meinto the park on another road.l didn't know there was another road,but he drove on before l could say yes or no. Were you alarmed? No.l'm not usually afraid of men.And anyway, he hadn't touched meor even said anything out of the way.Well, doesn't a woman sort of instinctivelyknow when a fellow's on the make?Oh, sure. But that's only usual with me.With men, l mean  almost all men.Ever since l was a kid.You, for instance. You're interested.But there isn't any reason to be afraid of you.lt was like that with Barney.Well, now, Mrs. Manion,believe me, l'm not in the least Call me Laura.Uh, Laura.l'm only interested in helping your husband.Nothing more.Oh, l don't mean you'd try anything.l just mean it's  it's the way you look at me.Well, it'd be very difficultnot to look at you.Oh, the way l dress, you mean?You don't like it?Oh, l love it. l just love it.Now, wewe'd better keepmoving along with this thing.Now, uh, how were you dressed that night?Oh, in a sweater like this and a skirt.And the rest. What about that?Underneath?l had on a slip and panties and a bra. No girdle? l don't need a girdle.Do you think l need a girdle?l don't know.l don't know. Ηow sh  l Look, l'm only concerned with a few facts...that might be of help to mein the defense of your husband. That's all. Well, l don't wear one.Okay. No girdle. Okay.All right. Now go on.Well, he turned off the highwayinto a lane in the woods...and he stopped the carand turned off the lights.And then he grabbed me, and he said...""l'm gonna rape you,""just like that. Did he use those words? Exactly those words.Muff began to bark,so he threw him out the window.l could hear little Muffywhining outside the car all through it.Barney began to try to get at me...and l fought him off as best l could,but he was terribly strong.Did you cry out? Did you scream?lt didn't seem to be much useout there in the woods.Ηe began to shout names at melike ""army slut"" and some other names.And then he drew back and hit me with his fist.Ηe hit me again, and l didn't fight anymore.l must've been only half conscious,but l know that he tore my panties off...and did what he wanted.Now, the newspapers saidthat a doctor examined you...and said that he didn't think you'd been raped.l don't care what the doctor thought.A woman doesn't mistake these things.All right. All right. Now go ahead.Well, l l don't know exactly what happened then.l must've fainted.But the next thing l remember,the car was moving.Barney was driving very fast,and  and he was breathing hard.An ugly, gasping sound.We were on the main road to the trailer park...and he swung in by the gate and stopped.l opened the door to get out. Muffy jumped outfirst, with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.Well, now, wait a minute.l thought you said...he'd thrown Muff out of the carback in the woods.Well, he did, but Muff wasin the car when we got back.Ηe must've let him back in. l don't remember.All right. All right. Now, you opened the door,and Muff got out first. All right.Before l could get out, Barney grabbed me...and said he was gonnatear all my clothes off and attack me again.l got away and ran.l could see Muff at an opening in the fence.Ηe was scooting back and forthwith the flashlight.Barney caught me from behind,and l fell to the ground.Ηe fell on top of me and beganto beat me again with his fists.l thought he was gonna kill me.l screamed, and somehow or otherl got to my feet again and ran.l went through the openingin the fence and followed Muffy.Ηe was running along ahead with the flashlight.And l kept following the lightuntil he led me to our trailer.And you didn't see Barney again?Never laid eyes on him again, dead or alive.Well, l l think that's enough for now.l've got lots of time. All you want.Where can l reach you?l'm still in Thunder Bay,but l can drive down again in the morning. Was there something else? No.Thanks for letting me play the records. Oh, you're very welcome. Thanks a lot. Bye. Who's that? The lady in the case.Oh.And you're not gonna take the case, huh?Well, l don't know. That depends on what Manionhas to tell me tomorrow.Ηe's thinking things out.Oh, well, that's more like it.Now, if l take the case, l want you in it.Me? ln a big murder case?Why, Polly, the sight of this whiskeydrinkingold man at the counsel table would ruin you.l need you.Do you mean that?Why else would he say it?Well, l'd be glad to work with yououtside of the courtroom...but not in the courtroom.Well, suit yourself about that. Either way,l'm gonna have to be able to depend on you.Will you lay off the booze?l don't know. l don't know about that, Polly.Why don't you know?Do you think l could lay off the booze?Ever tried it?Try it.l've never been on a big murder case.Not once in all my life.lt's up to you, Parn.Will you be around tonight?Yeah. Yeah. l'll be around.You know, Maida, darlin'...l might manage it.l might manage to be a real lawyer again.For a little while anyway.l tried remembering.There were still some pieces missing.l remember...going to Quill's bar with a gun...and l remember Quill's face behind the bar.But l don't remember anything else,not even going home.Don't you remember firing the gun?Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.Yeah, l remember hearing shots,but they don't seem to be connected with me.They seemed far away...like somebody else was doing the shooting.Lieutenant Manion, l'll, uh l'll take your case.Why, thanks. Thanks, Mr. Biegler.All right. Now, there'sthe little matter of the fee.Three thousand dollars.That's reasonable enough, isn't it?Oh, sure, sure. More than reasonable.l'll have to pay you later.Right now l'm broke. You're what? l'm broke. l'm flat busted.l don't have three dollars, much less ,. Well, can you raise it? Oh, yeah, as soon as l get outta jail.But, uh, next week's payday.l'll, uh l'll be able to give you $ .And if you get me off, l'll give youa promissory note for the rest.All right. Now, suppose l don't go alongwith you unless you pay me half the fee?Well, l'll have to takethe lawyer the court appoints. l got my defense now. Right? lnsanity. Yeah.l think l'll stick aroundand make damn sure you get off. Where do we start? We're gonna need a psychiatrist.As much as neither one of us has any money,do you think the army'll stir one up for you?Well, l know a colonel in the Pentagon. l'll write a letter. Good. Do that. Sulo.Where are you going now?l'm going to see your wife, for one thing.Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?That's right. l did.She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

No. That's a mistake, Polly. lt's open and shut. Well, maybe. We'll see.Judge Maitland is still in the hospital.Maybe you'd like to agreeto a continuance until he gets back.lf we go with the case now,we'll have to try...before some grabbag judge they'll send in. Me, l'd rather have Maitland. Yeah. So would l.But of course that'd also mean my clientwould lie around in jail...for another two, three monthsbefore the trial.Now, if you'll drop the chargedown to manslaughter...so l can get him out on bail,we'll agree to a continuance.You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.Oh, l don't know. l might.l might, since a great big fatlie detector test on his wife...has given proof to the rape story. He'd have the jury with him. How did you know what the lie  Bit, didn't l? Yeah. You did.Anyway, the result of a lie detector testisn't admissible evidence. You can't use it. No, but it carries moral weight.Mitch, l wouldn't sit in that chair too much.lt could shake a fellow's brains loose.l'll see you later.Ηe remembers you, Paul. Ηe likes you.He likes the beer in my icebox.Well, what's the occasion today?A buffalo hunt?l bought these in Arizonawhen we were stationed there. Aren't they smart? l think they're very smart. Ηere.

But we couldn't find anything but my glasses. Your glasses?You mean you were wearing glassesthrough all that?No. l had them in a case in my hand.l wear them for reading, playing pinball.Things like that.l must've tried to getout of the car and dropped them.Uhhuh.You, uh, might be interested to knowthat your lie detector test...turned out in your favor.Of course it did. l could've told you it would. You weren't worried about it? No. Why should l be?Would you like to havesomething to worry about?Silly.Like your husband watching usfrom his cell window?All right. All right. Let's have it. Did he say something to you? Just enough.Are you afraid of him?Yes.ls that why you volunteeredfor a lie detector test? For him? Yeah. Mmm.

From Washington.They'll let a doctor come to testify,but there's a string on it.They want me to go to an army hospitalin Detroit for an examination.Doesn't the army understand you're in jailon a nonbailable offense?That's it, as far as the army's concerned.l don't know how l can get around this.l'll try and think of something.Look. My wife hasn't been here for two days.Ηave you seen her? No, not for a while. Where the hell is she?You've got other thingsto worry about, Lieutenant.Now, l'll get in touch with your wife.l'll tell her you miss her.Yeah. You tell her that. Thanks, Sulo.

Good night.Ηear ye, hear ye, hear ye.The Circuit Court for the County of lron Cliffsis now in session.You can be seated.For those of you l haven't met,my name is Weaver.l'm from downstate, and l'm sitting temporarilywhile your good Judge Maitland...is recovering from a severe illness.There's no need, l think,to dwell at length upon my methods.One judge is quite like another.The only differences may be in the stateof their digestions...or their proclivitiesfor sleeping on the bench.For myself, l can digest pig iron.And while l might appear to doze occasionally,you'll find that l'm easily awakened...particularly if shaken gentlyby a good lawyer with a nice point of law.We will now take up the criminal docket.Case number one.The PeopIe versus CIarence Madigan.Breaking and entering in the nighttime.Will the defendant rise and come forward?That's me, Your Honor.""State of Michigan, Court of lron Cliffs.l, Mitchell Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...come into said county of lron Cliffsand give the court to understand...that one Clarence Madigan...alias 'OneShot' Madigan,alias 'Smoky' Madigan...did break and enterthe dwelling house of Casper Katz...and did there commit the felonyof larceny on said premises.""Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?Oh, no. A man's gotta have moneyto ask them fellas the time of day.Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,it's my duty...to appoint an attorney on your behalf.Oh, l wouldn't bother, Your Honor.l stole the whiskey.l'm guilty as hell.lt was a full case of expensive bourbon,Your Ηonor. Did you sell this whiskey? Oh, no. l drank it. All of it? You bet, Judge.Are you aware that it will be necessaryto punish you for this crime?lt was worth it, Your Ηonor.Well, l'll accept your plea of guilty, Mr. Madigan.You'll be sentenced later. You may now return to your place. Thanks, Your Honor.Case number two.The PeopIe versus Frederick Manion.murder.Paul Biegler for the defendant.My formal appearance is already on file.Which of these men is your client,Mr. Biegler? None of them, Your Honor. Mr. Sheriff...will you produce the prisoner?Well, l  l'm afraid l can't do that,Your Honor.Perhaps someone should explain.l'm not clairvoyant.The defendant is in Detroit being examinedby a psychiatrist, Your Honor.Shouldn't the court have been consulted...before the defendantwas allowed to leave its jurisdiction?Well, Your Honor, we're dealingwith the army in this matter...and this was the only crack the armywould give us at one of their psychiatrists.The court was not present,and it was very urgent...that we get the defendant to the psychiatrist.What does the attorneyfor the People say to this?lt was done with my knowledge, Your Honor.l've always heard that this Upper Peninsulaof our fair state was a queer place.lf it's customary here to allow a man chargedwith firstdegree murder to wander about at will...l don't suppose it behoovesan outsider to point out...that the law makes no provisionfor such quaint liberalism.Your Honor, the defendant is in the careof a deputy and will be returned this afternoon.We'll formally arraignthe defendant on his return.For the sake of the docket,can you give me a clue as to his plea?The defendant will waive readingof the information and stand mute.A plea of not guilty will be entered.The case of Frederick Manionwill be placed first on the trial docket.Can you hurry it up, Polly?Somebody tells that judge...the prisoner was lounging around the railroadstation, he'll really give me the works. Just take a minute, Sheriff. Okay.Thank you. Come on over here.Well, Lieutenant, how'd things turn out? l was temporarily insane. Did he tell you that?Yeah. Said he's gonna write you a letter...but, uh, l took some notes on my own. Doctor's name is Smith. Smith.Anatole Ludwig Smithor, uh, Ludwig von Smith, l hope. A name like that would impress the jury. No, just plain Matthew Smith.He said that when l shot Quill,l was suffering from ""dissociative reaction.""Dissociative reaction.Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn? Yeah. What does it mean in plain English? Well, it means l had...""an irresistible impulse to shoot Quill.""That's okay, isn't it?Yeah, but what did he sayabout your knowing the difference...between right and wrong when you shot Quill?l don't think he said anything.Why? ls that important?We better not keep the sheriff waiting.You better go.Thank you, Sheriff.You ever heard of a Michigan courtaccepting irresistible impulse as insanity?No. Maybe we better switch to selfdefense.Even Mitch Lodwick would makea monkey out of us on that.Damn strawberry soda. Here. Want a peanut? No, thanks.Well, tomorrow's Saturday.We just have the weekend before the trial. When do you want to start working? Tomorrow morning, early. Polly! Hey, listen to this, Parn.Never mind that. Just find...PeopIe versus Durfee, Michigan, . Year  .Yeah, that's it.l have it right here in the A.L.R.Listen. ""The rightandwrong test,though condemned as being unscientific...is adhered to by most of the states, but"" Listen to this ""but."" ""But the factthat one accused of committing a crime...may have been able to comprehendthe nature and the consequences of this act...and to know that it was wrong, nevertheless"" Dear, sweet, endearing word, ""nevertheless""!""Nevertheless, if he was forcedto its execution by an impulse by an impulse which he waspowerless to control...he will be excused from punishment.""Why, the Michigan Supreme Courtdid accept irresistible impulse, Parn.This is precedent.Boy, l think we got ahold of something here.Good old Durfee,  .Ηow about that? Give me a pad.By the saints, this strawberry soda popis beginning to taste like real bourbon whiskey.Well, don't get drunk yet.You know, we've got to convince a jury...that our client was irresistibly impulsed.Remember that.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...before we proceed further,it will be necessary for me to examine you...on your qualifications to sit as jurors.Will you please rememberthat you are under oath?Are all of you citizens?Will you please raise your hand if you are not.Are there any justices of the peaceor law enforcement officers among you?No.Are any of you related by blood or marriageto any law enforcement officer? No. So much for qualifications.l will now examine for cause.Do any of you have any business pending withthe prosecuting attorney, Mitchell Lodwick?No.Do any of you have any business pendingwith Paul Biegler, attorney for the defense?No.Are any of you acquainted with the defendant...sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left? No. Will Mrs. Laura Manion...the defendant's wife please stand? Do any of you know Mrs. Manion? No.Thank you, Mrs. Manion.You may be seated.Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.Your Honor, before counsel's challenge,may l introduce Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney generalfrom Lansing.Because of the peculiar nature of this case,l have requested the attorney general...to allow Mr. Dancer to sit inwith the prosecution.Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.lt's a privilege to have you in my court.Thank you, Your Ηonor.l'm sure it will be instructive.Do any of you jurorshave any business pending...before the attorney general's office?No.l must apologize for my disparaging remarks...about the Upper Peninsula and its customs.l've seldom seen a murder juryselected and sworn in less than half a day.You have won my heart completely, gentlemen.Now, Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.What's your problem?There was a little suggestionl wanted to make, Your Honor. By all means. Since the defense plea is insanity...the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.Under the statute, we have the rightto petition for a mental examination...of the defendant by our own doctor.Are you familiar with that statute,Mr. Biegler?Uhhuh. Moderately.l think it would onlydelay things to file a formal petition...so why don't we just, uh,get together and sort of...informally agree to ask Ηis Ηonorfor an adjournment?Only a day or so,and our doctor can visit with the defendant.l think it would save everyonea great deal of time. Don't you, Mr. Biegler? Yes, l'm sure it will. Good.But suppose you just go aheadand file that formal petition anyway.Of course, you're a little late, aren't ya?Well, maybe Ηis Ηonor will overlook that.And then, l'd sort of like the jury to see...that you think our insanity pleahas some merit.There really won't be any need for our doctorto examine your client.Naturally, l was only followingthe usual procedure. Well, naturally, l'm all for it. Uhhuh.Do you wish to file the petition or not,Mr. Dancer? Yes, Your Ηonor  lt won't be necessary.That's right. lt won't be necessary at all.Skirmish over.Shall we join now on the field of battle?The body of Quill had sustainedfive gunshot wounds.One of the bulletshad passed through the heart.Death, in my opinion,was almost instantaneous...and was directly caused by this wound. Dr. Raschid, may l have your detailed report? Certainly.l ask that this report be markedPeople's Exhibit One for identification.So received and marked.The People hand the defensea copy of the report.Counsel may crossexamine.Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was toascertain the cause of death, was it not?Yes.And yet, l read in your report here,that you checked...to determine whetherspermatogenesis was occurring...in the body of the deceasedat the time of death.Objection, Your Ηonor. The Peoplecall this witness only to show the cause of death.Your Ηonor, the entire reportwas offered as evidence...and the report contains this informationabout spermatogenesis.Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.The witness may answer.Yes, l made that examination on the deceased.Now, would you tell the court your findings?Spermatogenesis was occurringat the time of death.ln other words, the deceased, in life,was not sterile. He could produce children. That is correct. Now, Doctor...if a woman says that she has hadintercourse with a certain man...and the man is proved fertile, even thoughno evidence is found in the woman's body...could a lawyer  say a prosecuting attorney could he use this as evidencethat the woman is lying?Your Ηonor.l, uh, object to this line of questioning.We're not concerned here with whether or not...there have been relationsbetween a man and a woman.Your Ηonor, as long as an examinationfor spermatogenesis has been made...at least we're entitled to know why.Overruled. You may answer.Yes. Prosecution could use that...though it certainlywould not be conclusive that she was lying. Why not? There could be several reasons...why the test on her was negative.The, uh, use of a contraceptive...or  or possibly there was no completionon the part of the man.Now, on this postmortem were you also askedto determine whether or not...the deceased had reacheda sexual climax shortly before his death? No, sir. Could you have made such a determination?Oh, yes.So you were only askedto make such examination...as might be useful to the prosecution,none that might help the defense?l object, Your Ηonor.The question is argumentative.Counsel for the defenseis trying to impugn the intent...of the representatives of the People.Mr. Biegler, you must be awarethat the question is improper.l withdraw the question, Your Honor,and apologize.The question and answer will be stricken...and the jury will disregardboth the question and the answer. That's all the questions l had. No redirect.The People now call Lloyd Burke.Will the witness step forward, please.How can a jury disregardwhat it's already heard?They can't, Lieutenant. They can't....the whole truth,and nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do. Sit down, please.Will you state your profession,please, Mr. Burke? l'm a commercial photographer. Were you called upon by the police...to take photographsof the body of the deceased Bernard Quill...before and after he was removedfrom the scene of death?Yes, sir, l was.Were these photographsof the deceased made by you?They were.The reporter will please markthese photographs...People's Exhibit A to D for identification.Photographs are tenderedto the defense for examination...and the People movetheir admission as evidence. Your witness. Uh, no questions. No objections.Paul, he took pictures of me that night too.Just a minute, Mr. Burke.Uh, Mr. Burke...these photographs offered as evidence...are they the only photographsyou took that night?Why, uh, no.l suppose the others didn't turn out.ls that it?All my pictures turn out!Oh, of course. l  l beg your pardon.Did you give the other pictures to the police? Yes, sir, l did. Well, Mr. Burke, what were they?Were they side shots,or a shot of the moon, perhaps?Or a black bear scavenging the Thunder Bay dump?Your Honor, l object!l can't see how other photographs are relevant.The photographs in evidence were introduced...to show that the deceasedmet with a violent death.Well, Your Ηonor, l should think any photographpertaining to the case would be relevant.The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.What were these otherphotographs of, Mr. Burke?Lieutenant Manion's wife.You mean these photographs showed howshe looked that night after Barney Quill was killed? Yes. Your Honor, how she looked is irrelevant.No evidence has been introduced to connectMrs. Manion's appearance to a charge of murder. Sustained. l'm sorry, Your Honor.l just wanted to make sure the prosecutionwasn't withholding evidence.Now look here!l protest to the defense attorney'spersistent attacks...on the motives of the prosecution.The jury will disregard the remarkmade by the attorney for the defense.There's no reason to believe thatthe prosecution has not acted in good faith.My apologies to the prosecution,and to the court.But, Your Honor,as long as protests are being made...l'd like to make a protest myself.Now, l'm perfectly willing to take onthese two legal giants anytime, anyplace...but in all fairness,it ought to be one at a time.l don't want these two fellowspitching knuckleballs at me at the same time.lt seems to me you're battingclose to a thousand, Mr. Biegler...but your point is well taken.Whichever attorney opens with the witness...he alone shall continue with that witnessuntil the witness is excused.Thank you, Your Honor. No more questions.No questions. My, we're drawing well, aren't we? Where's Parnell?Parnell? Why? lsn't he here?No, he's not here. He's not in his rooming house,and he hasn't been there all night.You were the last to see him. Where is he?l promised not to tell, so don't ask me. Aw, he hasn't fallen off the wagon? No. Ηe was sober. Ηas he gone somewhere? He did borrow my car for something or other.Your car? That was smart.Ηe hasn't driven a car in  years.Ηe'll kill himself. Now where's he gone?My word is my bond.Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. You may proceed.Your Ηonor, the, uh the defense notices a third personat the prosecution's table.We were wondering if the courtshares our curiosity as to just who he is.l was about to introduce him.Your Ηonor, this gentlemanis Dr. W. Gregory Ηarcourt.Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatristin this case.We ask that Dr. Harcourtbe allowed to sit at our table as an observer.What are you gonna have him observe?The constellation of Taurus...or the life and times of a bumblebee?To observe the defendant, of course.Oh! Oh, well, that's fine. That's fine.The defense has no objection, Your Honor.l just wish to express my relief...that the new recruit is notadditional legal reinforcements from Lansing.Call Alphonse Paquette.Raise your right hand, please.You do solemnly swear that the testimonyyou shall give in this cause...shall be the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do. Take a seat, please. Will you state your name, please. Alphonse Paquette.You work at the Thunder Bay lnn,don't you, Mr. Paquette?l'm bartender there.Were you working on the nightthat Barney Quill was shot by Frederick Manion? l was. Were you witness to the shooting?l was.Will you tell us in your own words,please, what happened?l was at a table by the doorwhen Lieutenant Manion came in.Did you know Lieutenant Manionby sight and by name? Yes, sir. Go ahead.Well, he came inand walked over to the bar...and began to shoot.Ηe shot Barney when he came up to the bar,and when Barney fell...he kept on shooting down at Barney,behind the bar.Then he turned around and walked out.When Lieutenant Manion entered the bar,how did he appear to you?Well, he walked slow.Kind of deliberate, l guess you could say. Did he speak to Barney Quill? Not a word.Just walked over and pulled outhis gun, and bang. And then he walked out. Yes.When he walked out, how did he appear to you?Ηe seemed just like he did when he walked in.Like he was the mailman delivering the mail.When Lieutenant Manionwalked out of the bar, what did you do?Well, it happened so fast,l guess l was stunned. But then l ran out after him. Did you find him outside? Yes, sir. He was walking away. Did you speak to him?Yes, sir. l said, uh, ""Lieutenant,you'd better not run away from this.""Did he reply to you?Ηe said, ""Do you want some too, buster?""Was he pointing the gun at you?Well, he was holding the gun in my direction,but the muzzle was low.When he said,""Do you want some too, buster?""how was that expressed?Did he shout it? Was it hysterical? Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble? No, sir.Ηe just said it cool and hardand looked right at me.Did he appear to you,as far as you could tell...to be in complete possession of his faculties? Yes, sir, far as l could tell. Your witness.Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion...the wife of Lieutenant Manion,in the bar that night?Your Ηonor, there he goes again.This is immaterial and irrelevant.Your Ηonor, l don't see what the prosecution'sso jumpy about. l haven't gone anyplace yet.Well, let's see where he's goingbefore we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.Well, did you see Mrs. Manionin the bar that night? She was there. Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night? Yes. Do you remember when he returned?l think he came back around midnight.From which entrance did he come?Did he come from the lobby entrance...or come from that that, uh, outside entrance? lt was from the lobby. Mmhmm. And how did he appear to you at that time? Ηow do you mean?You understood the prosecuting attorneyvery well when he asked you that question...about Lieutenant Manion's appearance.Oh, well, he was just old Barney, like usual.You mean he was justgood old sober, reliable... gentle, saltoftheearth, friendtoman Barney? Your Honor! Your Honor!Your Ηonor, what kind of a question is that?l withdraw the question, Your Honor.Mr. Paquette...had Barney changed his clothessince he left the bar?l don't remember.Might his clothing have been differentwhen he returned?That is, might he have changed his clothes?l couldn't say. l didn't notice.Was Barney drinking that night?Well, he  he always had a few shotswhile he was talking to the customers. He was friendly. Oh, sure he was. Sure. Good old Barney.Well, now, how many shots would you saygood old Barney usually had?l don't know exactly.Wasn't he, in fact,pretty loaded that night, Mr. Paquette?Objection, Your Honor.Even if the deceased was dead drunk,it's no defense to this charge.Sustained.l suggest you get off this, Mr. Biegler.Mr. Paquette, what would you call a manwith an insatiable penchant for women? A what? A penchant.A desire, uh, taste, passion.Well, a ladies' man, l guess.Or maybe just a damn fool.Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.Well   What else would you calla man like that, Mr. Paquette?We can't see the drift of this, Your Honor.You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick. You may answer. Can you think of another name, Mr. Paquette? Woman chaser. Try again. Masher? Oh, now, come now, Mr. Paquette.Mashers went out withwhalebone corsets and hairnets.Did you ever hear the expression ""wolf""?Well, sure, l heard that.lt just slipped my mind.lt slipped your mind. Well, naturally it would. Clanking around in therewith all those rusty old mashers. Have you ever known a manwho you could call a wolf, Mr. Paquette? l'm not sure. Was Barney Quill a wolf, Mr. Paquette? l couldn't say. Or wouldn't? Objection.Sustained. The question was answered.He said he couldn't say.Mr. Paquette, when Barney returnedfrom wherever he had gone... did he relieve you at the bar? Yes. And what did he say to you when he relieved you? Said, ""l'll take over.""When you came out from behind the bar,where did you go?l went over to the tablewhere the Pedersons were sitting.Now, you testified that you were by the doorwhen Lieutenant Manion came in.ls that the reason you were by the door,because the Pedersons' table was there? Yes. Uhhuh.And how long was it beforeLieutenant Manion came in?l don't know exactly.Uh, maybe  minutes.And you remainedat the Pedersons' table all that time. Yes, they're friends of mine. ls there also a window beside that table? l think so. You think so.Ηow long have you workedat the Thunder Bay lnn, Mr. Paquette? About six or seven years. Well, now, does this window beside the table does it suddenly vanish and then reappear...and come and go in a ghostly fashion?No, sir. lt's there all the time.And while you were talking to your friends there,did you happen to look out of the window? l might have. And when you looked out of the window...were you looking for something special?No. No, l wasn't looking for anything.Didn't Barney Quill tell youto go over to that window...and watch out for Lieutenant Manion?Did he tell you to look outfor Lieutenant Manion?Ηe did not.Mr. Paquette,Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?With guns. He'd won a lot of prizesfor shooting, hadn't he? Yes. Did he keep any guns behind the bar?Well, he might have.lsn't it a fact that there are three concealedpistol racks behind the bar, Mr. Paquette?Your Honor, the defendant's pleais one of insanity, not selfdefense.l'm sure Mr. Bieglerhasn't forgotten that fact, Mr. Lodwick. You may answer. Are there concealed gun racks behind the bar?Yes.And how many peopleknow about these gun racks? l couldn't say. But isn't it a fact that Barney,every once in a while...he'd take the guns out of these racks,and twirling them on his fingers...he'd demonstrate his skill to the patrons? lsn't it? l don't remember.Oh, now, come on. Try and remember. Did you ever see him do that yourself? Once or twice he did. That's all, Mr. Paquette. No further questions. The witness may step down. Call George Lemon.Biegler's going off in all directions.What's he getting at?Raise your right hand, please. l have a feeling he's afraid of what we'll get at. ...shall be the truth Mr. Biegler's putting upa smoke screen for some reason. l do. Take a seat, please. Will you state your name, please? George Lemon.What kind of work do you do, Mr. Lemon?l'm caretaker of the tourist parkin Thunder Bay.l see the place is clean and orderly.l check people in,check 'em out and lock the gate at night.And what is your authority for these duties?l'm paid by Mastodon township, and l'm alsoa deputy sheriff  just courtesy, sort of.Did you see Lieutenant Manionon the night of the  th? The night Barney Quill was killed? Yes, sir.Will you tell the court...about how andand whenyou saw Lieutenant Manion? a.m.,a knock on my door waked me up.l went to the door,and Lieutenant Manion was standing there.Ηe said, ""You better take me, Mr. Lemon,because l just shot Barney Quill.""l told him to go back to his trailerand that l would call the state police.Ηow did Lieutenant Manionappear to you when he asked you to take him?Ηe said what he had to sayand did what l told him. There wasn't any fuss.Did he appear to you to be,as far as you could tell...in complete possession of his faculties?As far as l could tell, yes, sir.Take the witness.Mr. Lemon,did you go to the Manions' trailer?Yes, sir.Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer? Yes, sir. What was her appearance?She was a mess.Objection.No evidence has been introduced...to make Mrs. Manion's appearancerelevant to this case.Well, no evidence has been introducedto make Barney Quill's appearance relevant...but you didn't object to the question then.ls that because you know that Barney Quillbathed and changed and cooled off...after he raped and beat hellout of this poor woman?Your Ηonor, everybody in this courtis being tried except Frederick Manion! l must protest  Now listen! This is a crossexaminationin a murder case!lt's not a high school debate!What are you and Dancer trying to do?Railroad this soldier into the clink?Mr. Biegler,you are an experienced attorney...and you know betterthan to make such an outburst.l will not tolerate intemperance of this sort.lf you once again trythe patience of this court...l shall hold you in contempt.Sorry.Your Ηonor...l apologize,and it won't happen again.The witness's answer will be stricken,and the jury will disregard the answer. Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler. Yes, sir.Mr. Lemon...on the night when Lieutenant Manionawakened you and turned himself in...had you been awakened before? Had anything else disturbed your slumbers? No, sir. There were no soldiers singing? No, sir. Not in my park after  :. There were no women screaming? Well, those screams were down by the gate.Objection! Objection!l see no reason for objecting yet,Mr. Lodwick.Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.l didn't hear 'em myself.There were some tourists from Ohio in the park...and they heard 'emand told me about it the next day. Now, Mr. Lodwick. This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive Yeah, well, that's too much for me. The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick. Ηuh?Oh, uh, uh, no questions.The witness may step down. Call your next witness. Um Detective Sergeant James Durgo. Hi, Polly. Ηi, Jim. Come here.As soon as we break,you'd better phone that army psychiatrist. Tell him to be here day after tomorrow. Will do.Will you please tell mewhere Parnell has gone?Won't do.You're fired.You can't fire me till you pay me.Detective Sergeant James Durgo, state police.Were you called to Thunder Bayby Deputy Sheriff Lemon of Thunder Bay...on the night that Barney Quillwas shot and killed?Yes, sir, l was. My companion officer and lwere the first to be called in on the case.Sergeant Durgo, when you arrivedat the Manion trailer, who was there?Lieutenant Manion and his wife were there.What did Lieutenant Manion say to you?Ηe said that his wifehad had some trouble with Barney Quill that he had gone to the tavernand shot Quill.Ηe asked us whether Quill was dead or not.We told him he was.Ηow did Lieutenant Maniontake this information? He didn't seem surprised. What did you do then, Sergeant Durgo?l asked for the gun he'd used.Did you take Lieutenant Manion to the county jailhere in lron City on that same night?Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenantdown with his wife.On the drive to lron City, did the lieutenanttalk further about the shooting?Ηe remarked that if he had the whole thingto do over again, he'd still do it.During all this at the trailer, the drive to lron City how did Lieutenant Manion appear to you?Ηe was very quiet most of the time.Seemed clearheaded.As far as you could tell, would you say thathe was in complete possession of his faculties? Seemed so to me. Your witness.Sergeant Durgo, you testified that LieutenantManion told you that he shot Barney Quill...after he learned that his wifehad had some trouble with Quill.Now, were these the wordsLieutenant Manion used? ""Some trouble""?No, sir. Those were my words, not his.And was it your notionto come here and use your own words?No, sir. lt was not.And was the suggestion to call it ""some trouble""made by somebody here in this courtroom?Yes, sir, it was.All right, Sergeant.Now, would you tell the court...what words Lieutenant Manion actually used...to describe the trouble his wife had had?Objection, Your Ηonor.We've been over this before.This information would not be relevantto any issues before the court.This statement concerning some trouble...was brought out duringthe direct examination of Sergeant Durgo.Up to now you've adroitly restrictedall testimony as far as Laura Manion's concerned.All right. The cat's out of the bag.lt's fair game for me to chase it.This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,and it's getting sorer.l'd like to hear from the prosecution.The burden is on the defense to provetemporary insanity at the time of the shooting.Now, if the reason for the alleged insanityis important to this case...then that is a matterfor a competent witness...an expert on the subject of the human mind.What the defense is trying to do...is introduce some sensational material...for the purposes of obscuring the real issues.Your Ηonor, how can the jury accuratelyestimate the testimony being given here...unless they first knowthe reason behind this whole trial why Lieutenant Manion shot Barney Quill.Now, the prosecution would like to separatethe motive from the act.Well, that's like trying to take the corefrom an apple without breaking the skin.The core of our defenseis that the defendant's temporary insanity...was triggered bythis socalled trouble with Quill.And l beg the court l beg the courtto let me cut into the apple.Our objection still stands, Your Ηonor.Objection overruled.Sergeant Durgo, tell the court...how Lieutenant Manion describedthe trouble his wife had with Barney Quill.Ηe told us that Quill had raped his wife.Now, can you recall generally whatLieutenant Manion told you about this rape?Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleepsince right after dinner.That he was waked up by some noise.Screams, he thought.That he got up, opened the trailer doorand went outside.His wife came runningout of the dark and fell into his arms.You saw his wife in the trailer.How'd she look?She was a little hysterical.She'd been pretty badly beaten up.She had big black bruisesover her face and her arms. Did Mrs. Manion tell youabout this rape and beating? She did. And did she take youto the place where it had happened? Yes, sir. The next morning.And did you find anything there?Any sort of evidence pertaining to the story...that Mrs. Manion had told you?On the lane in the woods we foundsome tire tracks and some dog tracks...and a leather case with somehornrimmed glasses inside.We also looked for...a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's,but we didn't find it.Will the attorneys for both sidesapproach the bench, please?Mr. Biegler,you finally got your rape into the case...and l think all the detailsshould now be made clear to the jury. Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick? Absolutely.What exactly wasthe undergarment just referred to?Panties, Your Honor. Do you expect this subject to come up again? Yes, sir.There's a certain light connotationattached to the word ""panties.""Can we find another name for them? l never heard my wife call 'em anything else. Mr. Biegler? l'm a bachelor, Your Ηonor. That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?When l was overseas during the war,Your Ηonor, l  l learned a French word. l'm afraid that it might be slightly suggestive. Most French words are.All right, gentlemen. Back to your places.For the benefit of the jury,but more especially for the spectators...the undergarment referred toin the testimony was, to be exact...Mrs. Manion's panties.l wanted you to get your snickeringover and done with.This pair of panties will be mentioned againin the course of this trial...and when it happens,there will not be one laugh...one snicker, one giggle...or even one smirk in my courtroom.There isn't anything comicabout a pair of panties...which figure in the violent deathof one man...and the possible incarceration of another.Proceed, Mr. Biegler. Did you give Mrs. Manion a lie detector test? Objection.A polygraph test is inadmissible evidencein our courts.l only asked if he gave the test.l didn't ask the results.Ηe may answer that.l gave her a lie detector test at her request. After all this investigation,did you believe Mrs. Manion? l did. Even after the lie detector test? Your Ηonor, l object to that question!lt constitutes flagrant, sneaking subterfugeon the part of the defense counsel.Objection sustained.Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...a polygraph or lie detector testis not admissible in evidence...because no one has ever been quite sure...that some people couldn't lieto a lie detector and get away with it. Go ahead, Mr. Biegler. ln any case, Sergeant Durgo, you, yourself...in your own heart and mindare quite convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty. Yes, sir. That's all.Just a moment.Yes, of course.Sergeant Durgo, did you look for the pantieselsewhere than the lane in the woods?We looked in Barney Quill's carand his room in the hotel.We didn't find the panties.Do you know why Mrs. Manionrequested a lie detector test? l know what she said. What was that?She said she wanted everybodyto believe her story...because she knew it wouldhelp her husband.Was that the only reason she gave?She said she'd already sworn to her husband.She wanted everybody else to believe it too.One moment, please, Your Honor.Ask him in what manner she swore.Did Mrs. Manion say howshe had sworn to her husband?Yes, sir. She said she'd sworn on a rosary.Sergeant, this lane in the woods What's it used for? Where does it go?Used to be a logging road.Doesn't go anyplace. Just stops.Who uses it now? l think it's a road kids drive down to park. You mean it's a lovers' lane. l think so. Yes, sir. The witness is yours, Mr. Biegler. No more questions. The witness may step down.ln view of the evidence concerning rapewhich Your Ηonor has ruled admissible...the prosecution asks for a minute recessin order that we may bring in...another witness whomwe had not anticipated using. All right. We'll take a minute recess. Recess.Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?We forgot it.We didn't forget it.Manny said maybe we shouldn't tell that again.lt might have looked like something else.Like ll didn't believe her.Ηow much more didn't you tell me?Everything else.We told you everything else.ls that right, Laura?Oh, yes. Everything else.All right. Now get this, both of ya.When you get up on that stand,l want you to tell the truth.l don't want you to tellanything but the truth.Don't try and lie. Don't try and conceal anything,or you'll get skinned alive.This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.Dr. Dompierre, did you haveoccasion to come to the county jail...on the night of August the  th of this year? l did. Who called you to the jail? The police authorities. What did they want you to do?They wanted me to make a testfor the presence of sperm...on the person of a Mrs. Frederick Manion. l made the test. ln making this test, what was your conclusion? Negative. There was none. Your witness, Mr. Biegler.Doctor, in making these tests...did you notice any bruises or markson Mrs. Manion at that time?l did.Were you asked to determine the reasonfor these bruises?l was not.Where did you do the laboratory workon your test for sperm?Saint Margaret's hospital in this city. Who worked up the slides for you? A technician at the hospital.Well, wouldn't it have been betterto have these slides worked up...by a pathologist or an expert in this field?Well, yes, but the police were in a hurry...and l happened to know this young fellacame on at : in the morning.Wouldn't it have been especially betterto wait for the expert...if the possible question of rapehung on the result? lt would have been. Now, Doctor, in the newspaper...on the evening of August the  th,it was stated that you found no evidence of rape. ls that true? lt is not true. l made no such statement.But did you form an opinionas to whether Mrs. Manion had been raped? No. Why didn't you form an opinion?lt's impossible to tellif a mature, married woman has been raped. That's all. Doctor...did you have an opinion about whether or notshe'd had any recent relations with a man?lnsofar as no sperm was present...it didn't appear that she hadhad recent relations with a man. That's all. Just one more question, Doctor.The fact that no evidencewas present in her body...does not mean thatshe was not raped, does it?No.Do you know what constitutes rapeunder the law?Yes, sir.Violation is sufficient for rape.There need not be a completion. No further questions. The witness may step down.The People recallAlphonse Paquette to the stand.Your Ηonor, since counsel for the defensehas forced the question of rape...it becomes necessary to takethis additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.Mr. Paquette...would you take a look at Mrs. Manion,seated there behind the defense table?Was she dressed in this manneron the night of the shooting? No. How was she dressed?She had on a real tight skirtand sweater kind of thing.Sort of glued on. She was wearinga pair of red shoes with high heels. Was she wearing hose? No. She was bare legged. Was she wearing a hat? No.Um, Mr. Paquette, what kind of hairdoes Mrs. Manion have under that hat?Well, we'd be very happyto show the court Mrs. Manion's hair.Mrs. Manion, would you take offyour hat, please?Thank you, Mr. Biegler.Mr. Paquette, was she wearingglasses that night?l think she was when she played pinball.Considering the tight skirtand the tight sweater and the bare legs... what was the result in her appearance? Well Would you say that Mrs. Manion's appearancewas deliberately voluptuous and enticing?You could pretty muchsee everything she had.Your Honor, the defense will concedethat Mrs. Manion, when dressed informally...is an astonishingly beautiful woman.And we  Well, Mrs. Manion,stand up, please. Will you?As a matter of fact  Take your glasses off.As a matter of fact,it's pretty easy to understand...why her husbandbecame temporarily deranged...when he saw such beautybruised and torn by a beast.Your Ηonor, l protest.Mr. Biegler is perhaps the least disciplined...and the most completely outoforder attorneyl've ever seen in a courtroom.The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.Uh, was Mrs. Manion drinkingheavily that night?l sold her six drinks myself, and then Barneycame over and got some more for her. l don't remember how many. Would you say that she was tight? Oh, she was high, all right. What did she do to make you think she was high?Well, she took offher shoes and went barefooted, and...when she played pinball she'd kind ofswish around to give the machine English. You mean she was flipping her hips around. Yeah.Anything else?Well, when she made a good score, she jumpedup and down and squealed like women do.She was playing pinballwith Barney Quill that night, wasn't she? Yes, sir. What was her attitude toward Barney Quill?Friendly, l guess you could call it. More than friendly, would you say? l thought so.Why did you think so?Well, she  she'd kind of lean on him, anda couple of times she bumped him with her hip.Uh, would you say that Mrs. Manionwas making a play for Barney Quill?Objection. That calls for an assumptionon the part of the witness, Your Ηonor.l withdraw the question.Would you say that, uh...Mrs. Manion was free and easywith Barney Quill? l would. Your witness, Mr. Biegler.Mr. Paquette,the attorney for the People asked you...if Mrs. Manion was tight,and you said that she was high.Now, speaking as a bartender,what's the distinction between the two? l don't think l understand. Well, l mean...when we say a person's tight, we usually meanthat they're a little stupid with the drink. lsn't that so? l guess that's about it. Yes.And if they're high,they're gay and enjoying themselves. Yes. ln other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.Well, now, is there anything wrongwith being happy in Thunder Bay lnn? No. Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it? Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing? Yes.ls there anything unusual aboutseeing a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay? No. So Mrs. Manion's taking hershoes off in Thunder Bay...that doesn't necessarily meanthat she was being unladylike, does it? l guess not. Yes or no?No!Now, you testified...that Mrs. Manion was squealingand jumping up and down and and swishing her l think that was the expression you used swishing her hipsaround the pinball machine.Now, was she creating a disturbance?Was she attracting a crowd? No. Were all the men at the bar Were they all standing aroundwatching Mrs. Manion? No. But you were very conscious of Mrs. Manion.You were conscious enoughso that you can tell us all about her actions. Yes. And certainly Barney Quill,he was conscious of Mrs. Manion...because he was playing pinballwith Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say so? Yes. So it seems that only you and Barney Quill...were acutely aware of Mrs. Manionand her actions and her appearance.And maybe good old Barney,when he came up to get some drinks from you...maybe he winked and said, ""Alphonse,l'm gonna take this babe out and rape her."" No! No, he didn't. Yeah, and maybe you said,""Do it once for me, boss!""Objection, objection.Those are not questions. Counsel is attacking No more questions!The court's had about all of this dogfightit can take for one day...and l'm sure the juryis equally tired and hungry.Tomorrow the defense takes over,and with expedition, prayer...and a little selfdisciplineon the part of counsel...perhaps we can reach an endby Saturday night.Will you adjourn court?Ηear ye, hear ye, hear ye. This court standsadjourned until : tomorrow morning.Ηe's banged up a little,but there doesn't seem to be anything else.We'd like to watch him for a day or so. How much damage did he do? Wrecked a gate and a barn door.And he hasn't got a driver's license.Ηe'll have to appearin the J.P. court when he's able. The old fool. Speak kindly of the dead. Do you mind if l have a minute with the corpse? Sure, Polly.Now, was it worth trying to kill yourself...for whatever it is you've been up to?Ηow's the trial goin'?Well, l'm making a lot of noise.Dancer's racking up all the points.No, but come on.Now, where have you been?Quill hired Mary Pilantup north of the Sault Sainte Marie.Struck me funny he'd go all the way up thereto hire somebody just to work for him.l been up there nosin' around.Well, did you find anything useful?Not until l looked up her birth certificate.Born Blind River, Ontario,, out of wedlock.Simone Pilant. Father was a lumberjack. Barney Quill.Say, l'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant. lt's late, mister. l know. l know. This is important. Real important? Real important.Yes?Miss Pilant, sorry if l woke you up.There's a guy to see you. Says it's real important. What's your, uh  Paul Biegler. Biegler. I don't wish to see him.Okay.She, uh, said it's not important enough.All right. Now you call her backand tell her l mentioned Blind River, Ontario.l'll be in the bar.Evening, Alphonse.Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?Well, l think l'll try a little of both.What do you say we start out with a beer?On the house, and that's all you get.A beer. No questions, no answers.l'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.What are you so afraid of, Al?Will you sit over there, please?Miss Pilant, l owe you an apology.l was a little roughwhen l was out here before.l didn't know that Barney Quillwas your father. You didn't come here just to apologize. No. No.But the apology was part of it.To tell the truth, l sort of hopedmaybe it would thaw you out a bit.All l want you to do is just listen to me.Just for a few minutes.Now, l need some strong evidenceto back up Laura Manion's story about the rape.The prosecution's gonnaattack that story pretty hard.And if  if the jury thinks she's lying...well, that could turn the decisionagainst Manion, you see.Well, isn't she lying? Barney didn't dowhat she said he did. Ηe couldn't have. What did you know about your father? All l needed to know.Ηe took care of me and of my motherfor as long as she lived.Ηe was always there when l needed him.That's what l knowabout my father, Mr. Biegler.Will that back up Laura Manion's story?Miss Pilant, l don't want to get at you.l don't want to hurt you.l appreciate your affection for your father...but  but as a lawyer l've had to learn...that people aren't just good or just bad.But people are many things.And l kind of have a feelingthat Barney Quill was many things. l don't want to hear that. No, no, please. Please now, hear me out.l believe that Barney toldAl Paquette what happened that night...and he told him to go to this windowand wait for Manion.Barney stayed behind the barnext to a gun rack, just waiting.Manion came in and firedthe minute he got inside that door...and the first shot wentright through Barney's heart.Now, here's what l want you to do.l want you to try to persuade Alto come to the court as a defense witness...and tell the court exactlywhat Barney told him that night.That he'd raped and assaulted Mrs. Manion.Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.Why wouldn't he tell it, if it were true?l don't know. l don't know.But l know this.Everybody loves something or someone.Me, l love fishing...and an old guy by the name of Parnell.Manion loves his freedom.Ηe'd like to have a little more of it.Barney loved you. Maybe so does Al.l wouldn't blame him.But he doesn't want to hurt you.Ηe doesn't want you to knowthe truth about Barney...that he could be dangerous and brutal.Now, if you'd just ask Al.lf you could just ask him right straight out.Al?Al, Mr. Biegler knowsthat Barney was my father.He thinks you know somethingabout the night my father was killed...something you won't tell.Lawyer, l told you once,and l'll tell you again. No questions, no answers. Wait, Al.Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.ls there any reason you wouldn't tell methe truth about that, Al?What reason? Anything else, Mr. Biegler? No.l'm gonna leave a passfor you and Al at the trial.You might like to watchLieutenant Manion get convicted.You gonna spread it aroundabout Mary being Barney's kid?No, l'm not gonna spread it around, Al.Thank you for the beer.Good night, Miss Pilant.All right,now let's get at this rosary thing.Now, it's been testifiedthat your wife swore to you on a rosary...that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.Did you ask your wife to swear on a rosary?My wife was hysterical.She wasn't making much sense.l thought if l asked herto take an oath on a rosary...it might serve to calm her,make her think more clearly.Did the rosary help?She was able to tell mein detail what had happened.All right. Go on from there now.What did you do then, Lieutenant?Well, l  l had her lie on the bed...and l got some cold cloths for her head.And, uh  Oh, yes.l gave her a drink of brandy.After a while she became calm...seemed to go to sleep.Then l went to the closet,l got my gun, and l loaded it. Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill? No.Well, then why did you go to the closetand get your gun and load it?Well, lll knew l had to go to Quill's place.l thought l might need it.Why?l knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.l was afraid he might shoot me.Might shoot you if you did what?What were you gonna do?l'm not sure.l remember having some idea...of finding him...and holding him while l called the police.Well, that Mr.  what's his name Mr. Lemon, right at the tourist court there,he was a deputy sheriff.Why didn't you get him to go with you?Maybe because he always seemed to bejust the old caretaker of the park.Maybe because l wasn'tthinking about anything too clearly...except finding Barney Quill.Why didn't you go to a telephone,call the state police before you went to the bar?l don't know.l was in sort of a daze.lt was a horrible thingto see what had been done to my wife.Now, you say you were in a sort of a daze.When you got to the bar,did you see that the bar was crowded?l l didn't see anyone at the bar...except Barney Quill.Ηe was the only person l saw.What was he doing?l think he was juststanding there behind the bar.Well, now, did he makea threatening move to get a gun?l don't know.Ηe may have. l don't know.All right.Now, you say you went there to find him...to hold him for the police.Why did you shoot him?l don't remember shooting him.Now, when you left the bar...do you remember Alphonse Paquettecoming up to you and stopping you...and saying,""You'd better not run away from this""...and your reply,""Do you want some too, buster?""Remember that?ll seem to have a vague recollection...of somebody speaking to me...but l don't remember what l saidor what was said to me.When did you realize that you had shot Quill?l was  l was getting a drink of water.l remember my throat was so dry it hurt.And when l put the glass down,l saw the gun...on the kitchen sink beside the tap.l noticed the gun was empty.Now l'd like you to show the court and jury...just, uh just how you knew this gun was empty.Well, this gadget here...when it sticks up,you know the last round's been fired.Lieutenant Manion,on the night of the shooting...did you love your wife? Yes, sir. Do you still love her?Very much.The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.Lieutenant Manion...how many men have you killed?Now wait a minute.Your Ηonor, a man's war record in Lieutenant Manion's case, a great record certainly shouldn't be used against him.Your Ηonor, l'm as patriotic as the next man...but the simple truth is,war can condition a man to killing other men.l simply want to determinehow conditioned the lieutenant may be...to the use of firearmson other human beings.l don't quite like the question, Mr. Biegler...but l don't see how l can exclude it.Let him answer.l know l killedat least four men in Korea...three with a hand grenade...and one with my service automatic.l may have killed others.A soldier doesn't always know.Now, Lieutenant, in these acts of killing...did you ever have a lapse of memory... such as you had when you killed Barney Quill? No, sir.Did you ever havea lapse of memory during battle? No, sir. Were you ever submitted to a constant barrage...constantly in a sweat for many hours... constantly under attack, or attacking? Many times.Were you ever treated for shell shock,battle fatigue... or any war neurosis or psychosis? No, sir.Did you ever experienceany unusual mental state during the war? Well, l do remember having one great urge. What was that?To get the hell out and go home.You would do well to consider the seriousnessof the situation you are in. l'm sorry, Your Honor. l sympathize with the lieutenant.l expect he has the same feelingabout getting out of jail.But the main point here, Lieutenant,is that at no time during your war service...did you have a record of mental disturbance.You were always in complete possessionof your faculties.Yes, sir, that's right. No more questions. No redirect, Your Ηonor.Step down, please. Call your next witness.We call Laura Manion to the stand. Up these stairs and to the right. Thank you.Now, how long after you told your husbandwhat had happened...did he leave the trailer?l don't know exactly.Everything was kind of fuzzy. l l was faint, and l lay down on the bed.Ηe sat beside me.l vaguely rememberhis getting up and going out.l remember wonderingif he was going for a doctor.And then he came back in.lt seemed like just a few seconds,but it must have been longer.l must have gone to sleep.When he came back in,he sat on the bed...and he had a gun in his hand.And l said, ""What are you going to do?""And he said, ""l think l've already done it.l think l've killed Barney Quill.""Are you sure he didn't say""l've killed Barney Quill""?No, l  l remember distinctly.""l think l've killed Barney Quill.""Then what did you do?l put my arms around himand began to cry and and l said,""You'd better go to Mr. Lemon.""And my husband said, ""l forgot about that.""What did he mean? Forgot about what?Well, he meant that he'd forgottenMr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.And he said,""Yes, l'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon.""Yes, l see. Your Ηonor, l have no otherdirect questions at this time...but since l'm sureit's difficult to visualize...the part a little dog played on this night...l should like a few minutes to show the courtthis remarkable little animal.Do the People object?l'm sure if we raise an objection,Your Honor...Mr. Biegler will declare that we'rehaters of all small, furry animals.A creature that cannot talkwill be a welcome relief.Bring in the dog.Thank you, sir.Will the, uh, deputy bring in the dog, please.Uh, you can put him right there.Fine.Ηere, Muff! Here, Muff! Come on!Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!That's a boy.And now l'll ask Mrs. Manionto bring a flashlight for the dog.Now, l ask the court to noticethat the dog turned on the light.Well, it's easy to see that Muffdoesn't know who his enemies are.Remove the dog, please. Yes, sir. The witness will resume the stand.Ηere we go, Muff. All right.Mrs. Manion, may l congratulate youon your welltrained pet.May l also say that l'm pleased to see...you are not todayhiding your lovely hair under a hat.Your Ηonor, is the assistant attorney generalfrom Lansing pitching woo...or is he going to crossexamine?Let's get on with it.Mrs. Manion, what was your occupationbefore you were married? Ηousewife. Oh, then you've been married before? Yes, once. l suppose your first husband, uh, died, hmm?No.Did you divorce your first husbandto marry Lieutenant Manion?Your Honor, if counsel wants to knowthe grounds for Mrs. Manion's divorce...let him ask that question.What were the grounds for divorce,Mrs. Manion? Mental cruelty. Naturally. And how long after your divorce...was it that you marriedLieutenant Manion?Uh, l'm not sure.May l refresh the witness's memoryfor Mr. Dancer? By all means. l believe she told me...that they were marriedthree days after the divorce.Thank you, Mr. Biegler.ls that correct, Mrs. Manion?Yes.Then unless yourswas a whirlwind courtship...you must have known Lieutenant Manionbefore your divorce. Did you? Yes.Mrs. Manion, what is your religious affiliation?l'm a Catholic. Catholic in good standing? Well, no. The divorce, you know.You mean you were excommunicatedbecause of the divorce and remarriage?Yes.Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you saythat a Catholic who can blithely ignore...one of the cardinal rules of her church...could also easily ignorean oath taken on one of its artifacts...say, an oath taken on a rosary?lll don't think that's true.But wouldn't you think there'd be some doubtabout the integrity of such a person?l don't know. Uh All l know is the rosarymeans something to me.l see.Well, l'll pass on to something else.Mrs. Manion, you testifiedthat your husband came home late...from his workon the night of the shooting.Were you a little angry about his being late?Well, ll  l guess l was a little put out. Did you have an argument? Not much. A little.When you left the trailer to go to the inn...did your husband know you were going?Ηe was asleep.Was part of your reasonfor going without his knowledge...because you were, uh, vexed?Well, ll'd been ironing all day and l  Yes, l guess that's true. Your Honor, the counsel has deliberately...cut off my view of the witness.l'm sorry, Mr. Biegler.l wouldn't want to interferewith your signals to Mrs. Manion.l object to the implicationl was signaling the witness.This is the shabbiestcourtroom trick l've ever seen.You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.Your Ηonor, l ask the courtto rule on my objection.Mr. Dancer, will you be carefulnot to place yourself...between Mr. Biegler and his witness.Of course, Your Honor.Anything else, Mr. Biegler?You do it once more, l'll punt you...all the way out intothe middle of Lake Superior.Gentlemen, gentlemen.This rowing has got to stop.The next one of you that speaks out of turnwill have me to deal with.Now get on with your crossexamination.Would you have gone to the innif your husband had, uh, been awake? He probably would have gone with me. But would you have gone alone? Not if he didn't want me to. Would he have not wanted you to?l'm not sure.l  l don't know how to answer that.Well, had you ever goneto the Thunder Bay lnn...or elsewhere in Thunder Bayalone at night? Yes, sometimes. Did your husband know you were going?Not always. He goes to sleep early and and sometimes l'm restless.Where did you go on these occasions?Oh, l'd take a walk by the lakeor went to the bingo place. Maybe to the inn. You ever go to meet another man?No, l didn't. l never did that.You mean to say, Mrs. Manion,a lovely woman like yourself, attractive to men...lonely, restless, that you never once Objection, Your Honor! The witnesshas answered the question about other men.Counsel is now makinga veiled suggestion to the jury.l withdraw the question.Now, Mrs. Manion, on theseoccasional excursions into the night...did you always go and return home alone?Of course.Mrs. Manion, you testified that the reasonyou got into Barney Quill's car...was because you were afraidto go home alone.Why were you so frightenedon this particular night?l said that it was because he told mebears had been seen around.Was this the first time you'd heard that bearscame around Thunder Bay to pick up scraps? No. Had you seen the bears before?Yes.Oh, this was just the first timeyou were afraid of them?No, l was always afraid of them.Oh, this was just the first timeyou were enough afraid...to allow a man to take you homefrom one of your evening prowls?Objection! The use of the word ""prowl""is meant to mislead the jury. Sustained. l apologize.Mrs. Manion, l didn't mean to implythat you were a huntress.Was this the first timethat you were enough afraid...to allow a man to take you homefrom one of your evening walks?Well, it  it wasn't just that. lt was  Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.You should be able to answer that straight off.That's a simple enough question.Your Honor,how can the witness answer straight off...when the counsel keepsinterrupting the answer?The witness seemed a little slow to me,Mr. Biegler.Ηowever, let her complete her answersbefore you interrupt.Of course, Your Honor.ln any case, Mr. Biegler's objection...has given Mrs. Manion sufficient timeto think of an answer to my question.You've thought of one,haven't you, Mrs. Manion?What l was going to saywas that l didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...by making him thinkthat l was afraid of him or didn't like him.Ηe'd been very pleasant to my husband and mewhen we'd been in his bar. That's very good, Mrs. Manion. Very good indeed. Your Ηonor, please.The attorney for the People will reservehis comments for the arguments.l will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion.Was this the first time you had beenin Barney Quill's car at night?Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?Yes, l heard.Yes, it was the first time.Would you raise your voice a little,Mrs. Manion?l said it was the first time.Now, Mrs. Manion,l'm quite concerned about the lost panties.Would you describe this article of clothingto the court, please?They were nylonand had lace up the sides.There was a label in themof the place l got them the Smart Shop, in Phoenix, Arizona.What was the color of the panties? l believe white. You believe? l have white and pink. They may have been pink. You're not sure?Haven't you checked your lingerieto see which pair of panties is missing?No.When your husband came homelate from his work...and you had this little spat,were you already dressed to go out? No. When did you dress?After dinner, when he was asleep.lt's been stated here that you werebare legged in the bar. ls that true?Yes.ln your anger at your husbandand your haste to get out of the trailer... perhaps you didn't put on any panties either? Objection.The witness has already testifiedas to what she was wearing. Sustained. Do you always wear panties, Mrs. Manion?Now, Your Honor,l object to this line of questioning.lt's immaterial whatMrs. Manion does all the time.On the night she was attacked,she was wearing panties...and that's all we're concerned with.Your Ηonor, Mrs. Manion seemsa little bit uncertain...about what kind of panties she was wearing...and since these panties have not been found...l submit that it's possibleshe wasn't wearing any and has forgotten. That's all l'm trying to get at. You may answer, Mrs. Manion.Do you always wear panties?No.On what occasions don't you wear them?When you go out alone at night?Oh, no, no. Objection. Ηe says he's going afterone thing, then he goes after another.l'll sustain the objection.Strike out the last two questionsand Mrs. Manion's answer.Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties. You've done enough damage. Yes, Your Honor.Mrs. Manion, is your husband a jealous man? Ηe loves me. l'm sure of that, but is he excessively jealous?Your Ηonor, how can the witnessanswer that question?What's the norm of jealousy?Can you put your question a little differently,Mr. Dancer?Ηas your husband ever struck youin a jealous rage?No. Your Ηonor, l think Mr. Dancer's fishing now.What's the relevancy of this question?Your Ηonor,the shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.ln his own words,this is not a high school debate...this is a crossexamination in a murder trial.Proceed, Mr. Dancer.Mrs. Manion...did you ever go out sociallyin Thunder Bay?Yes, a few times.When your husband's outfitmoved to Thunder Bay...didn't Barney Quill throw a cocktail party... for the officers and their wives? Yes.Didn't your husband strikea young second lieutenant at this party?There was a little scuffle. lt wasn't much. What was it about? l'm not sure l remember. Were you too drunk to remember? No, l was not.lll think it was because the lieutenant...was cutting in too muchwhen l was dancing with my husband.And shortly afterwards,on the veranda of the inn...didn't your husband slap you hard enoughso that you fell against the wall? Well, hhe was drinking. Wasn't this a jealous rage? l don't know! Do you remember why he struck you? Yes. Wasn't he enraged at you...because he thought you'd encouragedthis young lieutenant?Ηe might have thought so.Mrs. Manion,there are witnesses to this whole affair.l'll ask you again. Wasn't this a jealous rage?l guess you could call it that.Now l'll ask you...on the night of the shooting,what did you swear?What oath did you take on the rosary?lt was about Barney Quill raping me.Why did you swear on the rosarythat he raped you?For the reason that my husband said because l was hysterical.That was the reason he gavefor asking you to swear. What was your reason for swearing? So he'd believe me. Why shouldn't he believe you? Objection.The reason for the use of the rosaryhas been established. These questions are immaterial. No, l think l'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.l'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.Why shouldn't he believe you?Because l wasn't making much sense.Did he think you'd lie about a thing like that?Objection, Your Ηonor! Lieutenant Manionhas already testified as to what he thought. Sustained. Did your husband strike you that night?Did he hit you that night?Well, he  he Ηe may have slapped mebecause l was hysterical.And didn't you swear to a lie to keep himfrom hitting you again?No! No, l didn't. l did not.Hadn't he already beaten you upat the gate when he caught you... coming home from lovers' lane with Barney Quill? Objection! Objection!The witness has already testifiedshe was beaten by Barney Quill.Quiet, quiet.No more questions.l think the witness has had enough,Your Ηonor.The witness may step down.We'll recess for lunch..Sorry, baby. You were fine.Dr. Smith?l've come to meet you, sir. My name is  l'm sorry. You've made a mistake.Maybe l'm the one you're looking for.Are you Mr. Biegler?No, l'm his associate in the case. Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith. That's me. The army psychiatrist? Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.No. Well...l didn't expect anybody so young.l'm .l sort of hoped you'd, uh, have a beardand wear a monocle.Oh, l see. That better? lt helps. You're on the stand this afternoon.Doctor, have you formed an opinion...as to Frederick Manion'smental and emotional state...at the time he killed Barney Quill? l have. And what is that opinion?He was temporarily insaneat the time of the shooting.At the time of the shooting, do you believe...he was able to distinguish right from wrong?Ηe may or may not have been.lt doesn't make too much difference.All right. Now, Doctor,as clearly as you can...will you explain Frederick Manion'stemporary insanity.lt is known as dissociative reaction a psychic shock which createsan almost overwhelming tension...which the person in shock must alleviate.ln Lieutenant Manion's case  a soldier it is only naturalthat he would turn to action.Only direct, simple actionagainst Barney Quill...would relieve this unbearable tension.This is not too uncommon.For example, in combat...some of the more remarkable heroicstake place in this state of mind.ls there another name for dissociative reaction,one we might be more likely to recognize?Yes, it has been knownas ""irresistible impulse.""Now, Doctor,a man in the grip of irresistible impulse would he be likelyto go to his neighbor for advice...or call up the police to come to his aid? Completely incompatible. Yes. But our man was able to think...of going and taking out a gun and loading it...before setting out to find Quill.Well, that was his conscious mind working.But if no gun had been available,he would have gone anyway.Ηow would a man look in the gripof dissociative reaction?Ηe might appear to be deadly calm,fiercely deliberate.Mmhmm. Would you describehis behavior as being...like a mailman delivering the mail?That's not bad. Like a mailman,he would have a job to do, and he would do it.Your witness.Doctor, did you find any psychosisin Frederick Manion?l did not. Any neuroses? l found no history of neuroses. Any history of, uh, delusion? None. Loss of memory? Not before this instance.Ηey. Can you spot Mary Pilant?She didn't come back after lunch.l think you'd better give up on that one.Doctor, you stated that the defendant...might or might not have been able to distinguishthe difference between right and wrong...but that it wouldn't have mademuch difference. Am l right? ls that what you said? Approximately, yes.Did you mean that at the timeof the shooting...he could have known the differencebetween right and wrong?Ηe might have, yes.Dr. Smith, if the defendantcould have known what he was doing...and could have known that it was wrong...how can you come here and testifythat he was legally insane?l'm not saying he was legally insane.l'm saying that in his mental condition...it would not have made any differencewhether he knew right from wrong.Ηe would still have shot Quill.Dr. Smith, are you willing...to rest your testimonyin this case on this opinion?Yes, l am.Your Ηonor, l'd like to ask for a short recess.The attorneys for the Peoplewould like to meet... with Mr. Biegler and the court in chambers. Mr. Biegler?Glad to oblige, Your Ηonor.Short recess. Jury will remain.Someday l'm going to horrify tradition...and lay a dense blue cloud of tobacco smokein that hallowed courtroom.What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?Your Ηonor, in view of Dr. Smith's testimony...l thought perhaps the defense might liketo change their plea. Change it to what? Guilty, of course. No, we'll still go for broke. Ηell, Polly.You know a guy's notconsidered legally nuts in Michigan...unless he didn't know right from wrong. Why don't you come on and get this over with? Your Honor, would you turn to page ?What's that?Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.Oh, l'm sorry, Your Honor.l make those thingsto help me think sometimes. For perch? No, that one's for frog.What case is he citing, Judge? We gig frogs down in my part of the country. Yeah, well, it's the same up here.l'm a trout man myself,but this is a new wrinkle l'm gonna try.They do it a lotdown in the bayous down south.The idea  they get a great big long pole...and about a tenpound line,just sort of drift along a high bank in a boat.Then you see thatgreat big old bullfrog in a crevice...and you sort of float this alongin front of him.Pop! That old tongue of his snaps out and  You've got frog's legs for supper. Well, l'll be darned. Why don't you keep it? Try it sometime. Thanks. l will.. What is it, Your Honor? PeopIe versus Durfee, .Looks like a precedent.Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?No, thank you, Your Honor.l think l recall the case.We're, uh, hooked... like the frog.Dr. Ηarcourt, where did you receiveyour university training?Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, Maryland.And where do you practice now?l'm the medical superintendentof the Bonder State Hospital for the lnsane.lt's been stated here that dissociative reaction,or irresistible impulse...is not uncommon among soldiers in combat. Do you agree with that statement? l do...but not as it was put by Dr. Smith. Where would you depart from Dr. Smith? Well, dissociative reaction...is not something that comes out of the blueand disappears as quickly.lt can only occur even among soldiers in combat if the individual hasa psychoneurotic condition of long standing.lt's been testified here that a psychiatricexamination of the defendant...showed no, um, evidence of neuroses...and no history of dissociative reaction.You've further heard it testified...that the defendant's behavior on the nightof the shooting was cool and direct. As an observer, do you remember this testimony? Yes.From this, have you formed an opinion...about the defendant's sanityon the night of the shooting?Yes. l'm of the opinion that he wasin sufficient possession of his faculties...so that he was not dominatedby his unconscious mind.ln other words,he was not in the grip of irresistible impulse? ln my opinion, he was not. Thank you, Doctor. Your witness, Mr. Biegler.Dr. Ηarcourt, psychiatryis an effort to probe...into the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.And in there,the world might be round, it could be square.Your opinion could be wrong.Dr. Smith's opinion could be right. lsn't that true? l'd be a poor doctor if l didn't agree with that...but l believe my opinion to be right.Now, do you think you might havechanged your opinion...if you had examined the defendant,as Dr. Smith did?l don't believe so.But Dr. Smith's opinion was made underbetter circumstances, wasn't it?lf you mean that he was ableto examine the man, yes.Yeah. Well, thank you, Doctor.That's all, Dr. Ηarcourt.ls there more rebuttal?We're over a barrel, Mitch.We have to use him.We call Duane Miller to the stand.Will the sheriff pleasebring in the witness?What can he tell?Nothing.Ηe can't tell anything.Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swearthe testimony you shall give in this cause...shall be the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth, so help you God?l do. Would you state your name, please. Duane Miller. Most folks call me Duke. Where do you presently reside, Mr. Miller?Across the alley in the jail.You know the defendant, Frederick Manion?Yeah, l got to know him in the past few weeks.His cell's right next to mine.When was the last conversationyou had with the lieutenant?Except for ""hello"" this morning,the last time was last night. Did you discuss his trial last night? Yeah, some.Would you tell the court what Lieutenant Manionhad to say about the trial?Well, l said, uh,""Things looking up, Lieutenant?""And he said, ""l got it made, buster.""Ηe said, ""l fooled my lawyer.l fooled that headshrinker.l'm gonna fool that bunchof corn cobbers on the jury.""You're a liar!You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!Come on. Come on.Take it easy.l apologize for my client, Your Honor.Yet his outburst is almost excusable...since the prosecutionhas seen fit to put a felon on the stand...to testify against an officerin the United States Army.Your Honor, l don't know who isthe worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.We're close to the end.ln the name of heaven, let's have peaceand courtesy for these last few hours.Mr. Dancer, you will continueyour interrogation without comment.Mr. Biegler, you will notsound off at every opportunity...and the defendant will remain seatedin his chair and keep his mouth shut. Now go ahead. Mr. Miller...are you certain that Lieutenant Manion said... ""l've got it made, buster""? That's what he said.Mr. Miller,did Lieutenant Manion say anything else?Yes, sir. He said when he got out...the first thing he was gonna do wasto kick that bitch from here to kingdom come. To whom was he referring? To his wife.Your witness, Mr. Biegler.What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?Arson. l copped out,and l'm waiting for a sentence.And how many other offenseshave you committed?Well, l was in reform school when l was a kid,but that's all.Your Honor,l'd like to see this man's criminal record.Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?Yes, sir.Ηere it is.Well, your record hereshows you've been in prison...six times in three different states.You were in three times for arson...twice for assault with a deadly weapon,once for larceny.Yeah. Also shows you've doneshort stretches in four city jails...on charges of indecent exposure,window peeping...perjury and disorderly conduct.ls this your true record?Them things are never right.Ηow did you get the ear of the prosecutionin order to tell them...about this conversation you hadwith Lieutenant Manion? The D.A. was taking us to his office. Taking who to his office? Us prisoners in the jail. He take you all at once, or one at a time?One at a time.Ηim and that other lawyertook us to his office...and asked us questionsabout Lieutenant Manion.Were you promised a lighter sentenceif you came over here... and went on the witness stand? Your Honor, the People object Overruled. Answer the question. l wasn't promised anything. Oh, you just thought...it would help your own troublesif you dreamed up this story to please the D.A.? l didn't dream up nothin'. You're sure that's what Lieutenant Manion said? Yeah, l'm sure. Just as sure as you wereabout your criminal record?Well, l guess l kind of goofed on that one.Your Honor, l don't feel l can dignifythis creature with any more questions.Take the witness away.Mr. Biegler, would youlike a conference with your client?l can see how the last witnesswas quite a surprise.No, Your Ηonor.We don't need a conference.l'll recall Lieutenant Manionto the stand right now.Now you've heard the testimony of this Miller.ls any part of it true?None.Lieutenant, do you have any ideawhy he might come here with a tale like that?No, sir.Ηave you ever talked with this man?Yes.And what did you talk about?Nothing important.Certainly nothing nothing about my personal life or my feelings.That's all l wanted to know.Lieutenant Manion...have you ever had any sort of...trouble with, uh, Miller?l don't know. What do you mean?An argument? Something like that?Well, did you ever, um, attack Miller physically attack him?Your lawyer can't answer the question for you,Lieutenant.Did you ever physically attack Miller?Well, l wouldn't call it an attack exactly. l pushed his head against the bars one day. Why?Ηe said something ugly about my wife.And do you remember, uh,pushing or bumping his head against the bars?Well, sure. l just told you.Then this was not dissociative reaction? The defendant isn't qualified to answer that. Sustained.Lieutenant Manion,wasn't your action against Barney Quill...much the same as your action against Miller...and against the lieutenantthat you struck at the cocktail party all in the heat of anger, with a willful,conscious desire to hurt or kill?l don't remember my action against Quill.Ηow long had you known your wifewas running around with Barney Quill?l never knew anything like that.l trust my wife.l suppose you just beat her up occasionallyjust for the fun of it.Nothing has been establishedto permit a question like that.Ηe keeps implying thingswithout ever getting to the point.Let him ask the lieutenant,did he ever beat his wife.l'll sustain the objection.Would you like to rephraseyour question, Mr. Dancer?No, thank you, Your Honor.l've finished.Well, then l'll ask him. Did you,Lieutenant Manion, ever beat your wife on the night of the shooting,or at any other time? No, sir. ls there any doubt in your mind...that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion? No, sir. That's all.Step down, Lieutenant. Are we hurt? We're hurt bad.Paul.Your Ηonor, l know time is very pressing.l don't want to ask for a recess.l would like to leavethe courtroom for a moment.lf it's important,we can be at ease for a minute.Thank you, sir.This is highly irregular, Your Ηonor.Well, there's no reasonto make a federal case out of it.Thank you very much, Your Honor.We now have another rebuttal witness.The defense calls Mary Pilant to the stand.Your Ηonor, we must protest this whole affair.The noble defense attorneyrushes out to a secret conference...and now the lastminute witness is beingbrought dramatically down the aisle.The whole thing has obviously been riggedto unduly excite the jury.lt's just another oneof Mr. Biegler's cornball tricks.Your Ηonor, l don't blameMr. Dancer for feeling put upon.l'm just a humble country lawyertrying to do the best l can...against this brilliant prosecutorfrom the big city of Lansing.Swear the witness.Raise your right hand, please.You do solemnly swearthe testimony you shall give in this cause...shall be the truth, the whole truthand nothing but the truth, so help you God? l do. Sit down, please.Where do you live, Miss Pilant?At the Thunder Bay lnn, in Thunder Bay. And how long have you lived there? For two years. And what's your profession? l manage the inn.Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundryhandled at Thunder Bay lnn?lt's chuted down to the laundry room.Where is the location of that chuteon the second floor? Between room  and . Who lives in those rooms?l live in . Mr. Quill lived in .Now, would Mr. Quill,coming up from the lobby...have to pass by the mouth of that chuteon the way to his room?Yes.Would it be very easy for him to drop somethinginto that chute as he passed by?Yes.Ηave you ever had occasion to go downinto the laundry at any time?Yes. Part of my job is to sortvarious pieces of laundry...as they come out ofthe washanddry machine.Would you tell the court what you found...among those pieces of laundryon the day after Mr. Quill was killed?l found a pair of women's panties. What did you do with them? l threw them in the rag bin.When did you learnthe significance of those panties?Ηere. This morning in the courtroom.And then you went homeand got them out of the rag bin? Yes. Did you bring them with you?Yes.l offer this article of lingerie...as exhibit number one for the defense.They're white,they have lace up the side...and they're badly torn...as if they'd been ripped apartby powerful hands.The label reads...""Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona.""lf there is no objection,the exhibit will be received in evidence.That's all, Miss Pilant.Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick, the prosecutingattorney, about the death of Barney Quill?Yes. Ηe came to the hotel several timesafter Mr. Quill was killed.Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't believeBarney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion? Yes, l told him that.

No.l was not given the panties,last night or at any other time.l found them exactly as l said.Do you know for a fact that Barney Quilldropped the panties down the chute... or did you just assume it? l assumed it.Ηad you thought that perhapssomeone else might have put the panties there  someone who wanted them found in the laundry? l hadn't thought of that.Mmhmm. And in the grip of what Mr. Bieglermight call irresistible impulse...you rushed in here with the panties...because you wanted to crucify the characterof the dead Barney Quill. lsn't that true? No. l thought it was my duty. Your pride was hurt, wasn't it? l don't know what you mean.Your Ηonor, he's trying to confuse the witness.Let him ask her a question she can understand.Yes, Mr. Dancer, l myselfwould like to know what you're driving at.Miss Pilant, when you found the panties...was your first thought that Barney Quillmight have raped Mrs. Manion...or was it that he mighthave been stepping out with Mrs. Manion?What does he mean?l don't know what he means.Mr. Dancer, once again l must ask you...to put straight questions to the witness.Ηere is a straight question, Your Honor.

Barney Quill was Was what, Miss Pilant?Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?Barney Quill was my father.No more questions, Your Ηonor.That's all for me.The witness may step down.We will recess for   minutes...after which we will hear the closing arguments.lf possible, l would liketo charge the jury before nightfall.Think they're gonna stay out all night?Can't somebody say something?What do you want me to say, Maida, darling?Tell me we're gonna win.l'm counting on gettingthat promissory note from the lieutenant.l hope we can borrow some money on it.l need a new typewriter.Ηalf the time the ""P"" and the ""F""don't strike on mine.""Party of the first part""sometimes comes out ""arty of the irst art.""Doesn't make sense.lt's embarrassing.""Arty of the irst art""?l kind of like that.lt has a ring to it.Twelve people go off into a room.Twelve different minds,   different hearts...from   different walks of life.Twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes.And these   people...are asked to judge another human being...as different from themas they are from each other.And in their judgment they must becomeof one mind  unanimous.lt's one of the miraclesof man's disorganized soul that they can do it.And in most instances, do it right well.God bless juries.l don't know what l'd doif l were on that jury.l really don't know.Do you?l loved that, Polly.l loved that ""humble country lawyer"" bit.You had Mr. Dancer dancing.l'm afraid he got in the last dance.That's the best summaryl've ever heard in a courtroom.l liked yours much better, Polly.Do you have to play that stuff?Can't you play ""Danny Boy,""or ""Sweet lsle of lnnisfree""?Paul Biegler's office.Yes, sir.

Ben-Hur,1960,"In the year of our Lord...... Judea, for nearly a century,had lain under the mastery of Rome.In the seventh year of the reignof Augustus Caesar...... an imperial decreeordered every Judean...... each to returnto his place of birth...... to be counted and taxed.Converging ways of many of them ledto their capital city, Jerusalem...... the troubled heart of their land.The old city was dominatedby the fortress of Antonia...... the seat of Roman power...... and by the great golden temple...... the outward sign ofan inward and imperishable faith.Even while they obeyedthe will of Caesar...... the people clung proudlyto their ancient heritage...... always rememberingthe promise of their prophets...... that one day there would beborn among them a redeemer...... to bring them salvationand perfect freedom.You'll be counted at Hebron. Name? Samuel. What city? Joppa. What family? Michael. Move on. Move on. Yes. Name? Joseph. What city? Nazareth. What family? David of Bethlehem.And the woman?My wife.Move on.You'll be counted at Bethlehem.Come on, come on.What village is this?Nazareth.We should arrive in Jerusalemtomorrow night.You're not watchingthe soldiers, Joseph?We've seen Romans before.Yes......and we will see them again.My table is not finished.Where is your son?He's walking in the hills.He neglects his work, Joseph.No.Once, I reproached him withforgetting his work. He said to me:""I must be about my father's business.""Then why isn't he here, working?He's working.Trumpeters of the legion!Welcome, Messala.The command is yours.Thank you.Thank you for relieving me.Drusus......when I was a boy, I dreamedof commanding this garrison.Now the wheel has turned.I am in command.Attention!Aisle one, face right!Forward!I'd forgotten the heat.If it were only the heat.I lived here until I was .Jerusalem was my home. My father was head of... Yes, I know.Your father is wellremembered.Fine governor.If there can be such a thingin this forsaken land.If you want to rise, Sextus,do the difficult.I asked to be sent here.You'll find the people changedsince you were a boy.In what way?Oh, won't pay their taxes,an irrational resentment of Rome...There's nothing new in all that.And then there's religion. I tellyou, they're drunk with religion.They smash the statues of our gods,even those of the emperor.Punish them.We do.When we can find them.Find the leaders.You don't know. There's nothingyou can put your finger on.There are strange forcesat work here.This ""messiah"" business...I know. There was onepredicted when I was a boy.A king of the Jews, who will lead theminto some sort of antiRoman paradise.Makes your head spin.There's a wild manin the desert named John......who drowns people in water.And a carpenter's son who does magictricks. ""Miracles"" they call them.There's always a rabblerouserstirring up trouble.No, no, no. This man is different.He teaches that God is near,in every man.It's actually quite profound,some of it.You've been too long away from Rome.Go back, Sextus.Go to Capri.Bathe, rest, lie by the sea......and forget thatGod is in every man. There is divinity in only one man. Yes, I know.The emperor is displeased.He wishes Judea made into a moreobedient and disciplined province.He's ordered me to restore order.I shall carry out his wishes.How? You can break a man's skull,arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.But how do you control this?How do you fight an idea?Especially a new idea.There's a Jew outside.He wants to see the tribune Messala.I assume he has a name. He says he's a prince, Judah BenHur. Then treat him like one!Tell him I will join him.Yes, tribune.Centurion!This was his countrybefore it was ours.Don't forget that.Yes, tribune.Very wise. This BenHur isthe richest man in Jerusalem.And the head of oneof the greatest families in Judea.We were friends as boys.We were like brothers.Sextus......you ask how to fight an idea.Well, I'll tell you how.With another idea.I said I'd come back.I never thought you would.I'm so glad. Look at you. Look at you!You've come back a tribune.When I heard that news,I drank a toast to you.We'll drink another now. Your sister and mother? They're fine.They've talked of youever since we knew you were coming. Is Tirzah married? No.Suitors come and go, but she dreams.She's been in love with yousince she was .I can't wait to see them.Do you still hunt jackals and lions?Or have you become too dignified? Down Eros, up Mars! Down Eros, up Mars!Where the beams cross?Good.After all these years!Still close.In every way.I hope so.I know.You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew......whose life you once saved.The best thing I ever did.Judah......it will be very difficultto govern here.I'm going to need help.Your help. Your advice. You want my advice? Yes, I do.Withdraw your legions.Give us our freedom.Unfortunately, the emperoris devoted to his empire.He's particularly fond of Judea.And Judea's not fond of the emperor.Is there anything so sadas unrequited love?My quarters.A bit grim.Not grim.Austere. Virtuous.Roman.I'm going to be secondincommandto the new governor, Valerius Gratus.He's coming in a few dayswith more legions.Then the rumors are true.The emperor does not approveof your countrymen.There is rebellion in the wind.It will be crushed.But you and your familyneed have no concern.I'm next in authority to the governor,and you're my friend. I'm a Jew. Ah, you are like a Roman!What have you in commonwith the troublemaking rabble? They're my people. I'm one of them. Be wise, Judah.It's a Roman world. If you want tolive in it, you must become part of it.You've changed.I've grown up. I've seen the worldsince I left Jerusalem.I've seen Rome. It's no accidentthat one small village on the Tiber......was chosen to rule the world.Your legions.It wasn't just our legions.Other countries have armies,fine armies. I know, I fought them.Oh, no.No, it was fate that chose usto civilize the world. And we have.Our roads and ships connectevery corner of the earth.Roman law, architecture, literatureare the glory of the human race.I believe in the future of my people.Of course you do.And you can help them.How?You're an aristocrat.Your family's name is honored.You're a prince to your people.You're rich and powerful.Your reputation is stainless.They'd listen if youspoke out against rebellion.Persuade your people thattheir resistance to Rome is stupid.It is worse than stupid, futile!For it can end in only one way,extinction for your people!I'm against violence.Everyone knows this.I've spoken against it.I shall do so again.Then we're agreed!Now, when can I cometo see your family? We had hoped tomorrow. Good.And now for our toast.It's dreadful wine, by the way.It's especially fermentedfor the Roman army.You're very cruel to your conquerors.It's an insane world.But in it there is one sanity:The loyalty of old friends.Judah, we must believe in one another.Will you drink to that?With all my heart.Here it is, the place I've remembered.The court where we playedat changing the guard.The roof where we'd throw pebblesat people in the street and then hide. We were rascals, weren't we? No, you were good boys.I would have that time again.And here it is. Nothing has changed.Except for the fountain. The old well would go dry, remember? Promptly, every summer.A new fountain and a new Tirzah.You've grown up. He hasn't changed, has he, Mother? No?Of course he has. He was a boywhen he left us, now he's a man.With great responsibilities.Come.The emperor builds and builds,turning brick to marble.Oh, I almost forgot.I brought you this.I've never seen anythinglike this before. It's beautiful! Is it Roman? It's Libyan. I was there last year.A tremendous campaign.Our armies met on the coast.After two days of fighting, they fled.We marched on their capital.Barbaric city, but fascinating.Or was, till we destroyed it.Now it's nothing but ashes.I'm boring you with soldier stories.Come with me, there's somethingI want to show you.Thank you for this.I chose the right present for you.It's a brooch for a woman.What do you think of it?Magnificent.It's Arabic.I think he has the look of the breed.I've raised him.Let me try him sometime.Whenever you like. He's yours.Do you mean you'll give me this?Oh, Judah.You are good. It's goingto be like old times, I know it.Judah, tell me, did you......think about what I said?Yes. Talked to a numberof people already.Spoken against violence,against incidents.Most of the men agree with me.Most? Not all?No, not all.Who does not agree?Well, the resentful, the impatient.Who are they?Yes, Judah. Who are they?Would I retain your friendshipif I became an informer?Telling the names of criminalsis not informing.They're not criminals, Messala.They're patriots.Patriots?!Let me explain something to you.Something you may not know.The emperor is watching us.At this moment, he watches the East.This is my great opportunity,and yours too.If I bring order here,I can have any post I want.You'll rise with me, I promise.And do you know where it can end?Rome! Yes, perhaps at the sideof Caesar himself.I mean it. It can happenand this is the moment.I swear, this is the time.The emperor is watching us, judgingus. All I need do is serve him.And all you need dois help me serve him. You speak as if he were God. He is God. The only God.He is power,real power on earth, not...Not that.Help me, Judah.I would do anythingfor you, Messala......except betray my own people.In the name of all the gods, what dothe lives of a few Jews mean to you?If I cannot persuade them, that doesnot mean I would help you murder them.Besides, you mustunderstand this, Messala.I believe in the pastand future of my people.Future? You are a conquered people.You may conquer the land.You may slaughter the people.But that is not the end.We will rise again.You live on dead dreams.You live on the myths of the past.Solomon's glory is gone.You think it will return?Joshua will not rise againto save you nor David.There is only one reality inthe world today. Look to the West.Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!Better a foolthan a traitor or a killer. I am a soldier. Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil. I warn you... No! I warn you.Rome is an affront to God.Rome is strangling my peopleand my country, the whole earth!But not forever.And I tell you, the day Rome fallsthere will be a shout of freedom......such as the worldhas never heard before.Either you help me or you oppose me.You have no other choice.You're either for me or against me.If that is the choice......then I am against you.There they are.Where's Messala? Where's...? He's gone.Gone? But why? He couldn't stay. What happened? A new tribune must have many duties.Come. Let us have dinner.Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,King of the world......who bringeth to usbread from the earth.We shall never see him again, Tirzah.He wanted to use meto betray our people. Master, the caravan from Antioch. Yes, Amrah, I saw.Simonides. Oh, welcome homecoming. Master.Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.Amber and jade for me.Silk for Tirzah.And for the master, Iberian wine.Not to mention the best gift of all,your presence.You do your servant honor.I also bring good news from Antioch. Caravans from Petra. Have all arrived. Good. Here is the accounting.And what of Numidia?The trade route is ours,guaranteed by treaty with the king.Once a year,you bring your accounting.And once a year,I find myself wealthier.Yeah, but my greatest treasureis my steward.My life belongs to the House of Hur.Nothing else exists for me,except my daughter. She must be a young woman by now. Yes, and your property.She was bornthe daughter of your slave.When I inherited you,I inherited a friend, not a slave.Still, Esther has come with me fromAntioch for your permission to marry.It's granted. I wish youthe joy of many grandchildren.If it is the Lord's will,I shall rejoice.With your permission,Esther wishes to speak to her master.You're eager to marry, Esther?It is my father's wish.Your husband will be fortunate.What is his name?David, son of Mathias.Of what house? His own, master. He is a freeman.Tell me more about him.I have seen him only once.He is a merchant,wellthoughtof in Antioch.He will pay for Esther's freedom.Her freedom will bemy wedding gift to Esther.You are generous, master.Do you love this man?I will learn to love him.You have my permission to marry.We'll drink to your happiness.And a safe return to Antioch.I disturbed you.No.What were you thinking?I was saying goodbye......to this city......and this house.You've not often been here.What do you remember of it?My father sometimes brought me here......when I was little.It was a housewhere I was always happy.Except once.When you and your friend,the Roman boy... Messala. Yes.You had been out hunting......and they brought you home injured.I touched your faceas you lay there......and prayed to God,""Don't let this boy die.""I can hear how you said it.Gently, as you say it now.Yes, master.Master?Why, I've given you your freedom.It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.And now......I hardly feel free.You know, in the old, wise daysof Solomon......if there was among his slaves......some girl who filled his eyes......he could choose her outfrom the rest......and take her to him.Wise days of Solomon.Different days.And long ago.If you were not a bride......I should kiss you goodbye.If I were not a bride......there would be no goodbyesto be said.Your slave ring.Fair exchange.Freedom to you. The ring to me.You will wear it?Until you meet the womanyou will marry?Until then.The gods favor my lord Gratus.If it is the governor's pleasure,the wreath of office.Thank you, tribune.I see no delegation from the city. There will not be one, sir. No?Jerusalem's welcome will notbe a warm one.But I pledge, my lord,it will be a quiet one.Let us proceed.There's Messala.He saw you, Judah.The new governor.Stand back! Stand back. You, come!Had to be the Jews!Open up in the nameof the divine emperor!Judah! Tirzah! What is it?What's happened?Open up in the name of the law! I was watching the... A tile fell and struck the governor. It wasn't my fault. They won't believe her.She won't have to say anything.You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.Open the gates!I'll speak to them. Arrest him! Let me tell you what happened. Hold those women. Stop them!It was an accident.Let me tell you what happened.It was an accident. This is the man, sir. We saw him. It was an accident. Accident? I swear it.I put my hand on the ledge.A tile was loose. It gave way.Take him. Take all of them. He's telling the truth! It was me! Let them go!Attention!Messala.In the name of God,tell them it's a mistake.I leaned on the tile,and it broke loose.It was an accident.Let them go!They had nothing to do with it!Let the servants go.Let them go. Return to your ranks.Come.Where?Tirus.Tirus?I've had no trial.I'm to die in the galleyswithout even a trial?There's no truth in the charge!Not a word of truth!Wait. My mother, my sister.What happened to them?Tie his hands. At least tell me if they're safe. I can tell you nothing.Get along. Keep moving.Jailer!Guard, in there!Up the stairs!Jailer!Jailer!To the right. Wait! Send them out.Go!The door.Where are my mother and sister?Where are they?Here, within these walls.The governor is recovering.They won't die.Of course, they will be sentenced.Is it possible?Is it possibleyou could do this to us?To people you've known?A family you've loved?You will let them go.You will gladly let them go!I didn't try to kill the governor.I'm not a murderer!I know you're not.You know?You are evil.No, Judah, I am not evil.I wanted your help.Now you've given it to me.By making this example of you,I discourage treason.By condemning without hesitationan old friend, I shall be feared.But not my family.Let them go.Please. Messala, I beg you. Beg?!Didn't I beg you?You chose this.There's nothing more to be said.Kill me, and your motherand sister will die......nailed to crosses in front of you!Go on, Judah.Kill me!May God grant me vengeance.I will pray thatyou live till I return.Return?Take him.Sentries, salute.The tribune will see you now.Tribune, I'm stewardof the House of Hur.I remember you.We were on our way to Antiochwhen we heard what had happened.Judah BenHur could not have donethis thing. You knew him, tribune.Better than you.Then there must be no doubt inyour mind, the charge is groundless.The prisoners have been sentenced. Sentenced? But there's no truth in it.There was never a threat againstthe governor in Judah's mind.Surely you must knowhe would never have done this.In your heart, you must know it.Drusus.This man had better be kept hereuntil we can question him.Hold!Water for the soldiers.Soldiers first!Get away from that well.No water for them!Get them away from that well!Here, you!Come on, you! Water for the horses! Water. Water. Soldiers first!Here.Wait.No water for him.God......help me.You! I said no water for him!All right, on your feet, all of you!Get them on their feet!Back in line, you dog!On your feet!Get them going!You there, back to your place!Back to your place!Forward, you dogs!Soon, the counselor's bargewill be coming alongside.Be ready to raise oars.Raise oars!Down oars!The new commander, Quintus Arrius. How many rowers? Two hundred, consul. And reliefs? Of , every hour.This man is ill. Replace him. Change him. Right, sir. This man's been giving you trouble? He's insubordinate, consul.That will stop.What service have you seen?Fortyone.A month's less a day in this ship.You keep an exact account.And before?Three years in other ships.Three years.You have the spirit to fight back......but the good sense to control it.Your eyes are full of hate, .That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.It gives him strength.Now, listen to me, all of you.You are all condemned men.We keep you alive to serve this ship.So row well......and live. Ship ready, consul. Strike oars.Strike oars!You know a fleetof Macedonian galleys......has been raiding Roman commerce.The emperor has honored uswith the task......of seeking out and destroying them.Battle speed, hortator.Battle speed!Attack speed.Attack speed!Ramming speed.Ramming speed!Rest.Halt!Rest!Why are you here?I was ordered to report to youduring my relief.Oh, yes.I'd forgotten.You could have killed meas I lay there.You're a condemned man.Why didn't you?I'm not ready to die.What do you think will save you?The God of my fathers.Your God has forsaken you.He has no more powerthan the images I pray to.My gods will not help me.Your God will not help you.I might.Does that interest you, ?I can see that it does.I'm a fighting man by profession,and in my leisure moments......it amuses me to train fighting men.I own some of the best gladiatorsand charioteers in Rome.Would you like to become one of them?To die as your slave?Better than to live in chainsbelow these decks.I will not be here forever.No?What would you do if you escaped?Two people were condemned with me,my mother and sister......though they were innocent.I won't rest...Do not say that you were innocent. Would it do any good to say it again? No.Consider my offer carefully. You willnever escape while we are victorious.If we are not, you will sinkwith this ship, chained to your oar.I cannot believe thatGod has let me live these years......to die chained to an oar.It's a strange, stubborn faithyou keep......to believe thatexistence has a purpose.A sane man would have learnedto lose it long before this.As you have.What drove it out of you?Go back to your oar, .Consul, enemy sighted.Signal the fleet.Prepare for battle.All the watch to battle posts. Stand by to load. Make ready to fire.Hurry, quick!Hurry up with that resin.Get some more ammunition.Raise oars!Down oars!Chain rowers!Guard.Unlock .No! I don't want to die!I don't want to die!, why did he do that?I don't know.Once before, a man helped me.I didn't know why then.Normal speed!Number , flame.Fire.Fire!Fire!Hold withdrawal on command.Lift oars! Raise!Withdraw!Steersman, right.Extend oars!Fire! Watch out! Fire!Steersman, ram course! Order below! Ramming speed! Ramming speed!Consul, barge on ramming course.We're going to be rammed!We're going to be rammed!Why did you save me?Why did you have me unchained?What is your name, ?Judah BenHur.Judah BenHur......let me die.We keep you alive to serve this ship.Row well and live.Is the sail square?I can't tell.Better for us both if it's the enemy.My death.Your freedom.It's a Roman sail.Face rear!Welcome, consul.We had given up all hope for you.Water.The fleet, all lost?Five galleys. And the battle? The battle was won.You have a victory. It was a victory? Complete.In His eagerness to save you......your God has also savedthe Roman fleet.Hail Arrius!Right oars!You have cleared the seawaysof a great danger, Quintus Arrius.This baton of victoryhas been nobly won.This man riding beside you, who is he?The man who saved me, divine emperor,to return and serve you.Is that all you know about him?No. He was accused of an attackon the governor of Judea.But he was innocent.If not, there's a strangeinconsistency in this man......who tries to kill my governor,yet saves the life of my consul.Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.We have all the informationon this man......a man of some influencein his own country.His attack upon our governor is oneupon the senate and the people of Rome.I am convinced thatno such attack was intended.Consul, allow us to continue.Allow us to be generous.As a reward to youfor your great victory......we shall not send him back tothe galleys. Take him as your slave.Such is the will of the senate......and the people of Rome.Not long ago, I returned to Rome......with a young manwho had saved my life.You all know him asthe finest charioteer in Rome.Five times, he's drivenmy horses to victory.I know him as one who standsin the place of the son I lost.I have the love and pridein a son's achievements......which I thoughtI should never have again.Nothing could make strongerour bond......but tonight I wishto share it with you all.The formalities of adoptionhave been completed.Young Arrius is nowthe legal bearer of my name......and the heir to my property.This ring of my ancestors......would have gone to my son.So now it is yours.It's a strange destiny thatbrought me to a new life......a new home......a new father.It brought me here.It may take me away.But wherever I may be......I shall always try to wear this ringas a son of Arrius should.With gratitude and affection......and with honor.My old friend Pontius Pilate,young Arrius.Before you came to this city,my horses always won.Magnificent horses, extremely swift.Yes, but not swift enoughto defeat you. Tell me, you come from Judea? Yes, sir.I hear that the climateis difficult to live in.Not for Judeans.It's a terrible prospect.I am to be made governor. Of Judea? Yes.I asked for Alexandria.But it seems the wildernessneeds my particular talents.The scorpions and holy prophetscan't get on without me.Lay the dust of Judea,at least for this evening.Goats and Jehovah.You're leaving.I must.It's a journey I can't keep you from.Your eyes have never left it allthese months. I can recognize pain.But still, my counsel is to wait.Gratus is to be replaced.The governorship goesto Pontius Pilate.When?Very soon.It's very much to our purpose.Nothing is to the purpose if, whenI come back to Judea, I come too late.That is the thought which has punishedme every moment I've spent here.Will Rome see you again?Here is a part of my lifewhich you have made for me.I shall remember it.Whoever the gods are, they takesmall interest in an old man's hopes.They have their way.Forgive me.You're a stranger here.Would you be from Nazareth?Why do you ask?I thought......you might be the one...The one that I have come backfrom my country to find.He would be about your age.Who?When I find Him......I shall know Him.Oh, but forgive me.I am Balthasar of Alexandria.I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.Sack of flesh without brains!No! No! Not the whip!That is my host.Gently! Gently!Fool! Headless toad!You know nothing of horses!Whip my children once andI'll drain every drop of your blood.Now, gently around the first turn,and let them run! Go on!Keep my words in your head!Let us see some wisdom!Beautiful horses.Now! Now! They are ready!Let them go!Watch. They'll never hold the turn.No! No!Abadon, stop him!Stop that whip!I'll kill him! I'll kill...!Moonhead!Give me those reins, you fool!You think you can treatmy horses like animals?!Drive cows and goats!That's all you're fit for!Get off, idiot!Drive goats, not horses!I am doomed.You saw what happened here?This traveler told what would happenbefore it happened.Your horses are very fine,but they're not a team.Not a team?But one of them held steady,the one on the outside. Antares. The slow one?He should run on the inside wherehe can steady the others in the turns.You have a keen eye.Where did you acquire it?In the circus in Rome.You have driven in the great circus?Tell me, my friend, could youmake my four run as one?I'm on my way to Jerusalem.Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?We have time enoughto eat, drink and talk.Come into my tentand refresh yourself.And let me hear how you raced in Rome.If I had a voice to sing,I would sing you the psalm of horses.No other animal hasdescended so in scale......from the first innocent fallingof the world.And tomorrow, I shall put Antareson the inside.When you do, shorten the yoke.It will help them in the turns.Judah BenHur.You're a Jew,yet you drove in the great circus.Yes.By a strange choiceand a stranger fortune.Your coming here was so fit, so right.We might have achieved wonders!You have to go.I make a journey which will not wait.Ah, well, then perhapsyou will come back.And when you do,bring your friends, your wives.I have no wives.No wives at all?I have six, no, seven.I've counted eight.And that is because he is traveling.At home, he has more.Believe me, it is a great advantageto have many wives. Someday, I hope to have one. One wife!One God, that I can understand.But one wife, that is not civilized.It is not generous. Was the food not to your liking? Indeed.Thank you. Thank you.And take my advice, my friend.Buy yourself some wives.And now I must say good nightto my beauties.When ready for sleep,they get impatient and jealous.They wait to see which oneI will embrace first. I'll make my farewells then. No, no, no, stay.Stay and see them.Come, my children. Come.Strangers make them shy.Come.Come, do not be afraid. Come.There, my children.They are descended fromthe Arabians of the Pharaohs......and I have named themfor the stars.Come, Antares.You are the slowest, and you canrun all day without tiring.What? Yes, yes.Yes, I love you too.There's my good Antares.Come, Rigel.We've both supped well,and the world is good.There's my good Rigel.Yes, you are ready for sleep.The day's work done for you, eh?Yes, well, you can goto sleep in a minute.Good night. Good night, my treasure.Steady, Aldebaran.I haven't forgotten you.No. You are the swiftest,but you must be steady.Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.You should see their mother, Mira.I dare not bring her.My people couldn't bear her absence.All right, all right.You are their friend, and they donot give their affections readily.Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.You must be strong and swift.Go, my children. Go.At Jerusalem, they'll racethe world's finest teams......and the champion of the East,Messala, with his black devils.He stops at nothing to win. Messala? In the circus? Yes.You knew him?I know him.Perhaps without much liking.My people are praying for a man......to drive their teamto victory over Messala.You could be that man, the one......to stamp his arroganceinto the sand.My horses need only a driverwho is worthy of them......one who will rule them with love.For him, they'd outrace the wind.It's not possible.That is a pity.Think of it. To break his pride......to humble this tribune beforethe very people he has degraded.Just think, his defeat and humiliationat the hands of a Jew!I know it is not possible.Does it not delight your imagination?Does it not answer your purpose?I must deal with Messalain my own way.And your way is to kill him.I see this terrible thingin your eyes.But no matter what this man has done,you have no right to kill him.He will be punished inevitably.I don't believe in miracles.But all life is a miracle.Why will you notaccept God's judgment?You do not believe in miracles.Yet God once spoke to meout of the darkness......and a star led meto a village called Bethlehem......where I found a newborn childin a manger.And God lived in this child.By now, He is a grown manand must be ready to begin his work.That is why I have returned here......so that I may be at handwhen He comes among us.He is near.He saw the sun set this evening,as we did.Perhaps He's standing in a doorwaysomewhere or on a hilltop.Perhaps He is a shepherd......a merchant, a fisherman.But He lives......and all our lives from now onwill carry His mark.There are many paths to God, my son.I hope yours will notbe too difficult.I'm ready for sleep.Balthasar is a good man......but until all men are like him,we must keep our swords bright.And our intention true.So I must leave you.One last thought.There is no law in the arena.Many are killed.I hope to see you again.Fine Damascus silk.Fine Damascus silk.Esther?It's Judah.You are alive.You are alive.What are you doing here?What has happened?I'm here.I'm with you.Where's your father?The day they took you away,they imprisoned him.They tortured him.When they were sure he was hidingnothing, they let him go.Ever since then, we have beenliving here, in hiding.You never went back to Antioch?No.The Romans took everything.There was nothing left for us there.Where are my mother and sister?Let me tell him first.Father.Father, something wonderfulhas happened.Judah BenHur is alive.He has come home. He is here.Judah.Judah BenHur.My dear old friend.Let me look at you.Let me see you.Yes, yes. It is true.Praise God for His mercy.Where are they?Since that terrible day......there has been no word of them.You should have been less loyal.Do not pity me, Master Judah.In fact, I'm twice the man I was.There is Malluch, my other half.We met in the dungeons of the citadel.We were released on the same day.Malluch without a tongue,and I without life in my legs.Since then, I have been his tongue......and he has been my legs.Together, we make a considerable man.Old friend.She always said you would return.She never gave up hope.Though I hoped it,I didn't believe it.I see that your one thought isto save your mother and sister.But suppose that isn't possible.If one purpose fails,it is good to have another.Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.They could not make metell them where it is.It is there still......to put power into our handsand buy death for the Romans.That's not why I came back.Judah, they are dead.Four years. No one could liveso long in the dungeons.Who lives more than one yearin the galleys?Yes, it is true.Judah BenHur.You have come back to uslike a returning faith.Judah, I should like to laugh again. Let us laugh. We will.There will be joy againin this house.We will celebrate among the dust.I will take him.We stood here before.A long while ago.Four years.But now it seems as if......only yesterday...I was saying:""If you were not a bride,I should kiss you goodbye.""""If I were not a bride......there would beno goodbyes to be said.""I am not a bride.Why did you never marry?My father needed me.And also...It's still on my finger.I said I should wear ittill I met a woman I would marry.It's become a part of my hand.If Messala once knew you were here...As he must.He will know where they are.And if you should find...? If he says they're dead... Messala will wish they were living.I've seen too muchof what hate can do.My father is burned up with it.But I've heard of a young rabbi whosays that forgiveness is greater......and love more powerful than hatred.I believe it. Esther. Judah.Stay alive.Keep away from Messala.Only if I can give upthinking and feeling.That time isn't yet come.The stone that fell from this roofso long ago is still falling.Only this time you won't be sentto the galleys.This time you will be destroyed.You'll die.Tribune, compliments of QuintusArrius. He awaits your pleasure. Consul here? Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.Thank him. Bring him to me. I didn't know the consul had a son. He's a champion of the great circus.Why is he presenting me with gifts? Perhaps he'll race against you. Look.It's magnificent.And from a man I've never met.You're wrong, Messala.By what magic do you bearthe name of a consul of Rome?You were the magician, Messala.You condemned me to the galleys.When my ship was sunk,I saved the consul's life.You know his seal?Now I have come back......as I swore I would.Your gift is exquisitelyappropriate, young Arrius.You suggest I use it on myself?What has become ofmy mother and my sister?It is not my dutyto keep track of prisoners.Find them, Messala.Restore them to me,and I'll forget what I vowed......with every stroke of that oaryou chained me to.I am not the governor.I can do nothing without approval.Then get it.I will come back tomorrow.Don't disappoint me, Messala.What became of them?It's been almost five years.Do you suppose they're still alive?Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out. And if they're dead? They're dead!""Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter.""Yes, they are the ones.Are they alive?E section......lower level.Cell two.Jailer on that level will know.Water.Water.Let me out! How long since you've seen them? Never.And I've been here three years.But they're alive all right.The food disappears.Lepers.They must be taken outside the cityand released at once.Then we'll burn out the cell.Is someone there?There is someone there.Who are you?Don't come any closer.Who are you?Esther.It's Miriam.Miriam.Miriam?Stay where you are.You have come home.Stand back, Esther.We are lepers.Oh, Esther.Tirzah.Esther......is Judah living?Yes, he is alive.He is here.Where?He is searching for you now.I must find him and tell him. No! Tell my father.No.Tell no one.We are going awayto the Valley of the Lepers.We won't return.Judah has to be told.No.Please.I couldn't see his face.Is it changed?No, he is not changed.He's not changed.You love him, Esther.Promise me......on your love for him......you will never tell himyou've seen us.Is he never to know?Let him remember us as we were.Promise me.There's nothing else I can hope for.Only this.I promise.I am content.Wait.Messala will find out.I am sure of that.I pray to God they're aliveand that Messala will free them.He'll free them.He wants to survive.He cannot free them, Judah.What do you mean?I saw them.You saw them?Where?When did you see them?They were dead.They were dead.When?When? When?!In the prison.When I was waitingfor news of my father.Why didn't you tell me?I couldn't tell you.Nor even you, Father.I was afraid thatif you saw Messala...Judah, you have cometo the end of your search.It's over now.Over? Judah. Over?Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.Go back to Rome.Gentlemen.Officers.Defenders of great Rome's Imperium......may I enter?Certainly, sheik.You do us an unexpected honor.The noble tribune is most gracious.And now......the question you're asking:Why am I here?As you know, I am a gambling man.The games approach.I am racing my whites against thenoble tribune's undefeated blacks.I will back my own poor horses.No limits? Mark me first! And me! What odds? A moment, please......my lords, protectorsof the far flung marshes.May I first sit down?Sit. How much will you wager? Yes, let's call his game. Give the Arab a seat.A bench, quickly.Thank you. Now.  denarii. ! Mark me!Your spirit does you credit, but donot be impatient. There is time.First gentlemen, the odds.The tribune has won many times. Theodds should be in the same measure.What is your pleasure, gentlemen?Two to one.Noble Romans, men of the Tiber,masters of the Earth......where is the couragethat made Rome master of the world?I can get better oddson any street market.Three to one.Let us not haggle. Let us be fair.In four years, the tribune has wonfour victories in the circus. In all truth... Just a moment.We know you have good horses,but who is your driver?Did I not tell you?How careless of me.The Prince of Hur.Judah BenHur.Prince of Hur? He was sent to the galleys years ago. He has returned.Returned? Impossible.The divine Tiberius is mercifulas always.Well?Will no one back the noble tribuneagainst a Jew, a galley slave?Perhaps I made a mistakein coming here.You, tribune......will you give me four to one?Four to one.Good.Four to one, sheik. The differencebetween a Roman and a Jew.Or an Arab.Bravely spoken.Now we will settle the amountof our wager. I will venture...A thousand talents? A thousand talents? Yes, a thousand talents.Of course, if it is too much...A thousand talents it will be.Agreed.Treat them well.They've earned it today.You're good fellows.If only men were this good.Remember, Altair......nine times around the circus.Aldebaran.Rigel, did you hear?Nine lives to live.My swift fellow.You must not win the racethe first time around.You win the last time around.And you cannot win alone.You must wait for the others.Steady Antares.Like a rock.You will be our anchor.I thought they'd never loveanother as they love me.They have taken me into their family.Rest well, my stars.Tomorrow we go up to the city.Then if you defeat Messala andthe new governor there to see it......the news will scorch the streetsof the Roman world.Pontius Pilate here?Yes, and ready to grindhis heel into us.You will make him seewhat men are born in this land.I only know thatI race against Messala.Look for the yoke.Ease that strap.God forgive me for seeking vengeance,but my path is set.Into Your hands I commit my life.Do with me as You will.The Star of David.To shine out for your peopleand my people together......and blind the eyes of Rome.They are ready.Easy, girl, easy.Number five.Where is number five?This is the day, Judah.It's between us now.Yes, this is the day.Look, he's driving a Greek chariot.Judah, be careful.Don't let him near you.Hail, Jupiter.

And the race over.It isn't over, Judah.They're not dead.Where are they?Where are they?Where are they?!Look for them......in the Valley of the Lepers......if you can recognize them.It goes on.It goes on, Judah.The race...The race is not over.Is there a way down here?Are you a madman?Keep well out of this place.Man.I'm searching for two women,a mother and daughter.There are many women.Of the family of Hur.We have no names here.For them? Why did you say they were dead? It was what they wanted.You must not betray this faith.Would you do this for them?Not to see them?They are coming.Love them in the way they must needto be loved.

I honor him. As you may honor yourself.You have been made a citizen of Rome.Do you say nothing to this?I have just comefrom the Valley of Stone......where my mother and sister livewhat's left of their lives.By Rome's will,lepers, outcasts without hope.I have heard this. There was greatblame there, very deeply regretted.Their flesh is mine, Lord Pilate.It already carries Rome's mark.Messala is dead.What he did has had its way with him.The deed was not Messala's.I knew him, well.Before the cruelty of Romespread in his blood.Rome destroyed Messala as surelyas Rome has destroyed my family.Where there is greatness,great government or power......even great feeling or compassion......error also is great.We progress and mature by fault.Rome has said she is ready to joinyour life to hers in a great future.There are other voices.The voice, for instance, of Arriuswaiting for you in Rome.He would tell you,if I may speak in his place......not to crucify yourselfon a shadow such as old resentment......or impossible loyalties.Perfect freedom has no existence.A grown man knows the worldhe lives in.And for the present, the world is Rome.Young Arrius, I am sure,will choose it.I am Judah BenHur.I cross this floorin spoken friendship......as I would speak to Arrius.But when I go up those stairs,I become the hand of Caesar......ready to crush thosewho challenge his authority.There are too many menof envy and ambition......who try to disruptthe government of Rome.You have become the victorand hero to those people.They look to you,their one true god, as I call you.If you stay here, you will findyourself part of this tragedy.I am already part of this tragedy.Return this to Arrius.I honor him too wellto wear it any longer.Even for Arrius' sake,I cannot protect you......from personal disasterif you stay here.You are too great a danger.Leave Judea.You have my word.I was afraidyou would never come back......afraid of what would happen to you.But I see you again.Your father's waiting for me.Where is he?What do you mean to do?Rest, sleep.For a few hours of the nightlet your mind be at peace.Peace?Love and peace.Do you think I don't long for themas much as you do?Where do you see them?If you had heard this manfrom Nazareth.Balthasar's word.He is more than Balthasar's word.His voiced traveledwith such a still purpose.It was more than a voice.A man more than a man.He said, "" Blessed are the merciful......for they shall obtain mercy.Blessed are the peacemakers......for they shall be calledthe children of God.""Children of God?In that dead valleywhere we left them?I tell you every man of Judea isunclean and will stay unclean......until we have scoured offour bodies the crust and filth......of being at the mercy of tyranny.No other life is possibleexcept to wash this land clean. In blood? Yes, in blood!I know there is a law in life.That blood begets more bloodas dog begets dog.Death generates death......as the vulture breeds the vulture.But the voice I heard todayon the hill said:""Love your enemy.Do good to those whodespitefully use you.""All who are born in this landhereafter can suffer as we have done.As you make us do now.Are we to bear nothing together?Even love?I can hardly draw breath......without feeling you in my heart.But I know......that everything I dofrom this moment......bears greater painthan you have ever suffered.It is better not to love me.It was Judah BenHur I loved.What has become of him?You seem to be now the very thingyou set out to destroy......giving evil for evil.Hatred is turning you to stone.It's as thoughyou had become Messala.I've lost you, Judah.No further.What are you doing here?I was here last eveningwaiting for you.I have waited all night.What has happened?Where is Tirzah?Leave the food.I am coming closer. Don't be afraid. What are you doing? Don't be afraid.I've heard Him again,the man from Nazareth.If ever words were from God,they are in everything He says.I cannot bear thatyou should have never known......this hand of quietreaching towards us.He is going to Jerusalem.We can find Him there.Bring Tirzahand we can go together to find Him.Tirzah is dying.Leave the food and go.It's Judah.Why did you tell him?Yes, Judah, yes.No nearer, please, God, no nearer.Mother.Wait, Mother, wait.Let me talk with you.Please.No, no further. Please.No, Judah. Son, no.Mother, let me see Tirzah.Tirzah is dying.Judah, if they would see Jesusof Nazareth they will know......that life is everlasting......and death is nothing to fearif you have faith.I will take them to Him.No!God, no!No, no, dear son.Mother......where is Tirzah?Judah, no.Judah, no.You must not go to her, dear son.Please.Dear son.I am afraid.No cause.The world is more than we know.Tirzah, it's Judah.No, Judah.Alms for the blind?Alms for the blind?Alms for the blind? Why are the streets deserted? They have gone to the trial.Trial? Whose trial?The young rabbi from Nazareth.They are wanting his death. This cannot be true. Alms?What has he done?Nothing I know of.For the blind, for the blind.Help for the blind. Look, lepers! Lepers!Get away! Stay away!Go away!Lepers! Lepers!How can this be?I know this man.Will someone help Him?Take pity on Him.Have mercy.In His pain......this look of peace.Watch over them, Esther.We must go back.I brought you here to this......when I hoped...You haven't failed, Esther.Hail King of the Jews!This is where your searchhas brought you, Balthasar.He gave me water......and a heart to live.What has He done to merit this?He has taken the worldof our sins onto Himself.To this end He said He was born......in that stable......where I first saw Him.For this cause,He came into the world.For this death?This beginning.I have lived too long.As though He were carryingin that cross......the pain of the world.So fearful, and yet why is it......I'm not afraid anymore?The shadow of a storm.A strange darkness......but still day.His life is over.What is it?This tearing.I am in pain.I feel it too.Do you see your hand?Almost at the moment He died......I heard Him say,""Father, forgive them......for they know not what they do.""Even then.Even then.And I felt His voice takethe sword out of my hand.English Subtitles bySDI Media Group"

He has, Your Grace.Good. Good.And when may I smell thispretty posy of yours?If you mean Annee, sir,she is still at her mirror.A new dress, nervous fingers. If youcould give her half an hour, perhaps? We have this whole day, Thomas. I’ve a new pack of houndsand there's a clump of deerin the meadow. We'll see one, hunt the other. Good hunting. You'll not be with us? It appears there are two poor soulswho seek religious comfort.I must go.Indeed, My Lord Cardinal, indeed.God's work must come first.And, who knows, there may bea little worldly profit attached.Oh, Your Majesty...Find them, bring them to me.Thomas, a private word with youbefore I meet Annee.Yes, Your Grace?There is always a temptationfor a man in my positionto regard the nation as his own troughand to eat from one end to the other. Not Your Grace. Why not? Who can say no to me?Except God, and He does, Thomas.I kneel. I pray. He answers.But can that be seen to be so?Why else would His Holiness the Popehave named you Defender of the Faith?True. True.I am a religious man.I want to do right by Godand the Church,and the people and myself,and you, Thomas.Do you follow?That's a swathe of folk to satisfy,if it includes God, Your Grace.It includes your two daughters, Thomas. Are they friends? Yes.And do they exchange confidences,do you think?Do they whisper together at nightsecrets about me, perhaps?Who knows, Your Grace?The one you have had,the other you desire.Will Annee have me, and for myself? I want an honest answer. She's no fool, My Lord.Good. Good.What I do is God's willand my prayer always isthat He will allow no thoughtto enter my heart or mindthat is not His will.He has...He has never failed me, Thomas.But Your Majesty realizesthis might seem as...As what?As an excuse to do as you please,to eat the trough dry.I’m the King of England.When I pray, God answers.Yes, Your Grace.And let no man dare question that.Or woman.Again. I’m angry with myself. Why?Well, think of the years I spentat the French court.I was surrounded by gallant,captivating, exquisite French courtiersand I loved none of them.No sooner do I returnthan I fall in love with a... ""Clodhopper"", said His Majesty. He was right.No mAnneers, can't dance,can't sing, can't... Can put his arms around you. Not as well as I’ve known it done.But they are the arms I want,for some God knows what reason.I love your awkwardness.But if we love enough to marry,we must keep nothing back.So? Are we to bed together? Before? If you like.Kiss me.Are you a virgin? I’m a man. I know, but are you a virgin?When we bed together,shall I be your first? I... Speak out.Well, I’ll say it franklyas they do in France.In England we make muddy mysteriesof such things as if they were crimes.We don't come out of a rainbow at and there's no use pretending we do.You may ask me whatever you like. Are you a virgin? No. In France? Yes. And long before.When I was little,I was playing with a boyand he threw me down...The King refuses youpermission to marry. But... Why? Why, My Lord?Marriages of the nobilityare affairs of State.I was wrong to encourage you.The King wishes you to marrya daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.I am pledged to Annee.It is a good match.I brought you to court. You're a memberof my household. You will obey.The world knew we meant to marry.Nothing was said against it.You've heard the King's pleasureagainst it.A half grown steer and a leggy girlwill not be allowedto overturn the policies of State.Why was nothing said?Her father, my father,and you, My Lord Cardinal,who knows the King's businessbetter than himself.Be silent!You will obeyor your estates will be forfeit.If you show further disloyalty,it's doubtful how long you'll live.The Duke of Buckinghamlost his head for less. Now go.You must go.Kiss me, then.Don't touch her. Be careful of yourself. I will, for you.My Lord, I love him trulyand we are pledged to each other.If you force him to marry elsewhere,although I am only a girl,you'll know you have an enemy.Madam, you do me wrong.I have no spleen against you,I am only a messenger.Messenger? Who has chosen for me?When Henry of Englandturns his eyes on a girl,she can hardly look away. The King has asked for me? He has.And sent you to me?It is sometimes my dutyto anticipate his desires.Even in carnal matters,My Lord Cardinal?We have had the King in the bosomof this family for some years.My sister Mary is with child by himand of no further use.I shall not go the way of my sister.You would be wise to anticipatemy answerand spare His Majesty any Anneoyance.I will not be a mistress of the Kingeven with the blessingof a prince of the Church. Good sport in Boleyn's woods. And in his bowers.I heard you, Norris.Well, you two, tell me,man to man, all kingship aside, what's the best way to win a maid? A maid?I couldn't swear to it medically,but it's young and it's wild.My skills are not forthe grade of female you seek.I’m more successful with waiting women.Don't be modest.I’ve followed your spoor so closethere was scarce timeto close the window you left byor change perfumesto put me off the scent.Speak on, your lure,your most seductive. You'll not be offended? I’ll be offended if you hold back.If you truly want her, make her believethat you are potent only with her.Pretend that you've tried with others.Gone to bed, kissed hotly,but hung embarrassed and unable.But with her you rouse up.You're a man again.They can't resist that.They open like...Never mind the simile.Yes. What a game. What a ploy.Dare I ask, has Your Graceever been refused by a wench?Who? I? Refused? Why, never.When I’ve wanted them, I’ve had them.When I’ve had a wench, I’m cured.That's general, isn't it?Your Grace, can you all leave talkingof virgins to look at the venison?Yes, yes. Come, come.Next to the haunch of a virgin,there's nothinglike a haunch of venison.Do you also offer me upto this royal bull?You, my father?And you, my mother? Lower your voice! Do you know what it is to be in love? I love Harry Percy and will marry him. You'll have us all dead or disgraced.Lower your voice.The royal bull can't force you.Brother, I must fight. I must.Do you know what it meanswhen a king asks for you?I can ask my pregnantand foolish sister.Turn him away and we can say farewellto all we've worked for.If our parents had not taken advantagewhat would've become of us?If we lose favour, we lose everything.Then say goodbye to it all,for I will not take the King to my bed!Your Majesty.I was so anxious to see you, madam,I ran ahead.Have you been faithful to meor lying about with this husband?Remarkable women you breed, you Howards.[laughter]Norfolk, greet your sister.I’ve brought your brotherto make sure I was welcome.George, you should have hunted with usand not stayed at home with the ladies.Nan. Give me a kiss. Yes, Your Majesty.And now on the lips, sweet Nan.I’ve been taking medicines for a cold.My breath is foul, Your Grace.Your health is very dear to us.You must needs keep well.We live all too brief a span.What little we haveshould not be wasted.Well, there's no trace of medicineor fever on these sweet lips.The surprise of Your Majesty's visitmust have cured me.Wonderful. I shall continue the cure.Shall I dismiss the chaperones? By your leave. Yes, by your leave.Yes, without your leave.Off. Out. All of you, go.Companions, brothers.Lawyer. Go.Annee, you see before younot the King, but a poor fellowas uncertain, as eager,as hopeful, as afraidas any man that ever fell in love.I see the King.Believe me, all kingship on one side.Women give love to the Kinglike paying taxes.I wish to be loved for myself.Well, as you say you're not the King,but only a poor, uncertain,eager, hopeful fellow.Could you tell me why the King sent anold Church pander to give me my orders? Pander? The Lord Cardinal Wolsey.Oh. Did he speak clumsily?No, Your Grace.He spoke to the point.What the King wants, he will have.No, Annee. It’s quite the reverse.What you want, you shall have. If I have you first. Not against your will. Not? Never.I’ll earn your loveand then your bed.Tell me what things you want.Prove me.There is one thing I want.I want something that has gone.You shall have it.Now walk with me, talk with me.I love your sweet voice,your company and your bold spirit.Tell me, dare I ask it?Is there anything about methat you love?No.My God.You asked not to be treatedlike the King.I would have lied to the King.No one has ever talked to melike that before.My sweet voice will not lie to you.But in time, Nan,you'll grow to love me.Anything is possible.With us everything is possible.That's settled. I can return to London. You, Cromwell, will remain here. Here, My Lord?To keep me informed.Tell My Lord of Suffolk that we shallentertain no more such petitions.Show that to Sir Thomas More,that's his province.Ah, Thomas.You smell of horse sweat.His Majesty has sent me to inform you,My Lord, that the......entertainment at Hever suits himwell, and he intends to remain.Excellent. No, tell Lovellhis request is denied.That witch has been leading hima dance for two weeks.She'll go the way of all the rest.Granted.The King should be attending to mattersof State, not pursuing a reluctant girl.If he wants her, he should take her.What is Sir Thomas More's opinionabout that?Master Cromwell,when you counsel the Kingtell him what he ought to do,but never what he is able to do.If he knew his real strength, itwould be hard for any man to rule him. He ought to leave Hever. Let sleeping kings lie, Thomas,and we'll see to the governmentof the country.Nan, it's a cruel thing to benear a woman day after day,to touch her when you wanted to,to have her company when you asked itand to have no response.To burn with love as I do for youand be denied any pleasurein your cool company.It is a cruel thing, Nan,to be denied love.The same cruel thing has happened to me.I’ve fallen in love. Nan! But not with you.My God. I got it right in the facethat time. Percy, is it?You know.You had Wolsey send him away. That blundering... I mean to marry him. Never! But not as my sister is married.He won't be a complacent husbandand I shall not be accessible to you.All wives are accessible.Any husband can be placated.Then you have nothing to fear.Let me marry him.No! I want you all to myself!Nan. Nan.If you give yourself to methis whole kingdom will turn around you.Whatever you wanted for anyone.knighthoods, revenues,you shall dispose of themexactly as you please.And be thrown out in the end? What greatrevenues does my sister dispose of?Well, Mary asked for nothing.I won't bargain. Ask for what you want.My freedom. To marry whom I love.Never.I’ve heard what your courtiers sayand I’ve seen what you are.You're spoiled and vengefuland bloody.Your poetry is sourand your music is worse.You make love as you eat, witha good deal of noise and no subtlety.This is not safe.Yes, I’ve been told it's not safefor any of us to say no to our King.That put on, kindly,hailfellowwellmet of yours.My father's house will be pulled down,and Northumberland's too, they tell me.Well, pull them down, Your Majesty,you are what I said.There is no better way to make an endthan to raise anger in me.I thank you for that. You madea fool of me! And I’m well out of it!Your Grace! You will not harm Harry Percy? I’ll try not.Vengeful and bloody as I am,I’ll try not![grunts] Where are you from? Northumberland. I’ve a message for the Lady Annee. You better rest. Give me the letter. Give it to no one but the Lady Annee. All right.Harry Percy is married.""Annee, my love, forgive me"". The King did this. Not the King, Wolsey.See here.''I would have held out. But for yoursafety, dearest Annee, I had to marry.''That would be Wolsey's threat, that youwould suffer if Percy remained defiant.God, I can't believe it.The pain is so great, I want to die.Pain goes, my child.Few of us marry where our hearts lie.[shouting, cheering]Damn all entertainmentand damn all women!Why must I want the one womanwho doesn't want me?I’ll see her!Elizabeth.For God's sake make her hurry. When theKing is hungry he's in an evil temper.I’ll see to this.Will. Let's see what the lady Elizabethhas decided. He's never returned to a woman. Lucky for all of us and your child. Henry was generous with his children. Learn from me, Nan.Lock up your heart,never surrender completely.I shall not surrender myself at all.The moment you're conqueredhe'll walk away.That's enough!I hate him only a little lessthan I hate Wolsey. Ready? Are we ready? Quite ready, Father.* Farewell, farewellMy pleasure past* Welcome my present pain* Welcome the torment In my heart* To see my love again* Alone, aloneI longed for her* While mistresses forsaking* Now must I tell my hopes and fear* Of love In her awaking *Bravo, Your Majesty! Bravo!Bravo, Majesty.No other king can write as you do,Your Majesty.That cheers me, Elizabeth.Someone, I forget whom,said once that my music was sourand my poetry worse.That caused me great anguish. True verseand music grow from suffering.I heard it in my mindwhen I woke from a troubled sleep.I wrote it down without a correction.It sings what is truly in my heart.If some young man wrote this songfor you, Annee, what would you say of it?I would ask him how his wife liked it,Your Grace.You shall dance to my tune, mistress.The Basse dance I composed.Play. Be merry. Dance.Annee, why do you taunt me?Percy is married, Your Majesty. None of my doing. I see.Wolsey is King of England, is he?That's enough. I am the King.If you dare to treat me likea bawling boy in front of my court, I’ll tear this castle down. Do so.Annee, even a king cAnneot choosewhere he will love.I want no one in this kingdom but you.That's why I’ve returned.You are not free to love,you have a wife.If a man is married, king or commoner,he is not free.I never married Catherine.England married Spain.My father coupled my brother Arthurwith Catherine for the Spanish Alliance.Arthur died and I became heir, so it wasdecided that I, in my turn, should......marry my dead brother's widow.I was  and she .So England and Spain married,not Henry and Catherine.There's a...There's a curse on that marriage.All my sons were born dead.For  years I’ve had dead sons.Now she's past the ageof bearing children.What has this barren marriageto do with you and me?You cAnneot touch my heart.You cAnneot bribe me with favours.The only love I will give you is thelove of a loyal subject for her king.Very well then.As your King,I command you to return with meto the court.I command you to beladyinwaiting to my wife,Catherine the Queen.You will be in my presenceevery day of your life.Then we shall see. Was he shouting for me? Bellowing. How they all tremble when he bellows. And you?Does that tremble?No. But you so hated coming hereyou spoke wildly. I fear you might provoke his anger. That was six months ago.I’m still young. I love dancingand new clothes and gifts. And power.Power is as exciting as love,I discover.And who has more of it than the King?The warship will be launchedfrom Portsmouthin five days time, Your Grace.Here is the warrant.But a name is needed for the vessel.The ""Annee Boleyn"". The ambassadors from Spain? Deal with them yourself.She almost reigns. She entirely rules.And I believe gives... nothing for it. She could prove powerful. Thomas, this is a man's world.The seat of power does not liebetween a woman's legs.Wolsey, Nan reminds me that herfather's patent of the Earl of Wiltshire has not yet been drawn. Indeed. It should be done at once.Good. Good.I must tell you, My Lord,a game we ladiesinwaiting play.A game of titles.Who has the most titles in the land?I said that, of course, His Majesty.But another said, ""No, no"".""The great Cardinal Wolseyhas more than the King"".""He is Bishop of Tournai, of Lincoln, ofBath and Wells, Durham and Winchester"".""He is also Archbishop of Yorkand Papal Legate in England,which puts him abovethe Archbishop of Canterbury"".""Who knows?He may one day be Pope"".""So he is the most powerful churchman"".""He is also Lord Chancellor andtherefore the most powerful layman"".I said, ""How fortunate for His Majestythat the good Cardinalis devoted only to the Kingand to England"".""Consider how dangerous it would beif so powerful a manhad ambitions of his own"".His Sovereign,I confess your royal favoursshowered on me are more than I deserve.I can render nothingbut my thanks, my prayersand my unending loyalty.And what livings would you shedto prove your loyalty,my good Vicar of Hell?Any, or all, sir, at your command.And your wealth, My Lord?I believe he is richer even than you. So many livings, so many palaces. I wonder.Such vanities mean little to meif I may serve you.Choose anything I haveand it is yours, Majesty.I will. I will.When I have given it some thought.Thank you. Thank you, Annee.My Lord, you are as generousas you are great.I shall ask the King to show meyour palace at Hampton Court.Bull'seye.Come, girl, play something cheerful.Men prefer women who laugh and are gay.Well, what more do you want? Nothing. For yourself, your family and friends? Nothing. Liar!You have a taste for power. It’s verycommon. I’ve seen it many times.You don't get it for nothing.You have to pay.You ordered me to court.The power is yours, not mine.I’m mad for you. I dream of youat night. I long for you by day.And you dare tell methat I have the power?I’m no good with any other woman.I think of nothing but you,of you and me playing dog and bitch,horse and mare,of you and me in every way.I want to fill you up night after night.I want to fill you up with sons.Bastards. They would be bastards.One word more and I’ll strike you.One word more.Without marriage, if you and Ihave sons, they will be bastards.Annee.Forgive me. Forgive me, Annee. Who is it? Norfolk, with a message from the King.The devil take him.Bess. Bess, be gone. Come on. Out you go, out you go. What?For form's sake. Come on, come on.Enter.Well?The King commands that youcome at once to the Palace at Greenwich.Does he, My Lord?Is he ill?Is there some urgent danger?A boat is waiting.Norfolk!Is the tide with or against us?I leave such details to the boatmanand other riffraff, My Lord.You may go.Enter.What keeps you half the nightfrom getting here?Your Grace, pardon me.Tide is flooding.Tell the Lady Annee the law of England,My Holy Lord Chancellor.Is it not true that I can makelegitimate whomsoever I choose? Most certainly. The documents can be drawn at once? Within the hour. So?Could any child of the King's bodybe made legitimate?Yes.And such a child would be heirto the throne of England? Most certainly. Thank you. Thank you, Thomas. Take the flooding tide and go home. Wait.Madam?Surely such a child would be heirto the throne after the Princess Mary,daughter of the Kingand his rightful Queen? Well, My Lord? That might be argued.No. Let us have it clearly.Princess Mary is first in lineagainst any son His Majestymay father out of wedlock.After Mary comes the Duke of Richmond,his bastard by Bessie Blount.Can you deny that he would inheritif she died?Richmond? Oh, he's a sickly fellow.I doubt if he'll live out the year.Then my sister's child by the King.We're affectionate, Mary and I,and forgive each other little things,but if she would rather her sonsat on the throne than mine,I would rather mine than hers.And so mine, you must agree,would be fourth in the lists.Who knows, madam,you may not be capable of a son.I’ll give the man that marries mea houseful of lusty sons.Marriage.If I were free of Catherine...You cAnneot be free of Catherine. If I were... It is impossible.For the last time,if I were free of Catherineand made you the Queen of England,would you marry me?Yes.If you make me Queen of England,I’ll marry you......and give you sons.Meanwhile...I’ll go alone to my bed,with Your Gracious leave. Brilliant, Your Grace. Brilliant. You think so?Yes. Keep promising her marriageand the siege will soon be over. In a month you'll have breached her. You think I was lying?If wooing, praise,gifts and power have failedthen you must try a new strategy.When I go down on my hunkers and pray,good Cardinal, as I do day in, day out,there's only one thing I pray.Show me how to save Englandfrom chaos when I’m dead.That prayer has just been answered.I shall remarry and have a son. Divorce? Catherine? Anneulment.My marriage is cursedand my sons born deadbecause I’ve transgressed God's Lawin marrying my brother's wife.It was incest and I’ve been punished.I was never married in the eyes of God.Indeed you were, My Lord.Thoroughly married.The Pope granted you a dispensationto marry Catherine when Arthur died.Because England and Spainneeded one another.Because your brother was and had not consummated the marriage.At , I was rogering maidsright, left and centre.At the time I believed, and the Popebelieved, and my father chose to believethat Catherine was virgin.I was deceived.The marriage was consummated.Prepare the evidence.Get me a case for Anneulment.My Lord, I beg you, as your faithfulservant, I beg you to consider.Catherine is a princess of Spain.Try to Anneul your marriage and you'llgather enormous forces against you.Spain, Naples, Germany, the Netherlands.All of them ruled by Catherine's nephew.The Roman Catholic Church. Your own people who love the Queen. I will marry Annee!It could mean war.It could mean the loss of your kingdom.I will marry Anneeif it breaks the Earth in twoand flings the two halves into the void!No. I don't believe it of him.I fear it is true, madam.As Spanish Ambassador, it is my dutyto have... many sources of information.Then it is Wolsey, not the King.That butcher's cur, Wolsey,who put it in his mind.Wolsey is preparing the caseto take to Rome.Enter.The King is here.He wishes to see Your Majesty.I will do all in my power to aid you.I will send word today to your nephew. Yes and to His Holiness. This Pope bends to the wind.Your hope lies in your nephew. Your Majesty. My Lord Ambassador.It delights my heart to see youprivately after so many months, My Lord.Sit, Kate. Sit.Kate,I’ll come bluntly to the point.God tells me that our marriage is a sin.My conscience is deeply troubled.Incest will be punished and wehave been punished with dead sons.Our daughter, Mary,is alive and well, Henry.Our marriage must be Anneulled.Then it is true.Wolsey has brought you to this.Kate. Kate, it's God's will. My conscience is clear.Help me, for both our sakes.Support me in my case to the Pope.But I’m your wife.Do you believe I can ask Pope Clementto tell the world that my father lied?My mother lied?Ferdinand and Isabella,the most christian princes,that each of them lied that my marriageto your brother was never consummated?Your own father signed the paperwith them.God knows he lied like a Trojan,in season and out.I’ve had little happiness in my life.I was a lonely girl,brought from Spain at to be used for English politics.When Arthur died I was pushed asideand kept here for seven yearsuntil I could be used for you.And you, I loved.With you I had my only happiness.I love you still.Then do as I ask!No. I will not betray our daughter.Our daughter is a threat,not a blessing.I must...I must have a son!Get one then,from one of your women!I’m your wife and your Queen.And neither your nor the Popecan make my child a bastard!If you defy me,I’ll have you sent from the court.You shall be shut away in the country.It’s you then, and not Wolsey,who really wants this thing.I will have it!I too gave evidence that my marriageto Arthur was never consummated.Did I lie to the Popeall those years ago?Did I lie to God?Did I lie to you?No.I will live and I will die your wife.And your Queen.As soon as I reach Rome, I shallsend dispatches back via Holland.See that messengers are there.Not long.Not long to wait now, Nan.I shall believe iton the day it happens.Your Grace.Yes?The Spanish Emperorhas captured the Vatican. Captured the Vatican? Rome is sacked.The dead in their hundredslie unburied in the streets. And the Pope? Is besieged.What...?By your gracious permission,in private.[courtiers gasp and mutter]Well?The Pope had fled from the Vaticanto the town of Orvieto. We exchanged letters. Yes and the Anneulment? He refuses to Anneul your marriage. He cAnneot! He cAnneot do anything else. What's his reason?The Spanish Emperor'sgot him by the nose.The Pope won't offend that Emperorby Anneulling his aunt's marriage to you.Poor Henry.He shall, by God Almighty.I say he shall!And to hell with the Spanish Emperor. Sir Thomas. My Lord Bishop.Shall you in your conscienceaccept the Anneulmentif the decision is for the King?The Pope has answered the King's appealand has sent Cardinal Campeggioto try this case.Campeggio speaks for His Holiness.I will accept that.I shall speak against itwhile I have breath.I shall be silentuntil I am forced to speak.Well, I’m an old man and have no family.At my age a good death is betterthan a bad conscience.Well, you will be the mother and fatherand I shall be the uncleof a queen next week. God be praised. I wonder what Annee is thinking.Out there are my bishops,my courtiers and my loyal subjects.Campeggio is not your subject.But I am, Your Majesty.And I promise you the verdict.You shall see, Annee.Wolsey has never failed me yet.Pray silence for His Grace,the Lord Cardinal of York.Our commission from Romehaving been publicly read,this inquiry will now proceed.Henry, King of England,come into court.Here, my lords.Catherine, Queen of England,come into court.On. On.What can I doif the Queen will not appear? My Lord Cardinal. Ecco.The King may now proceed.My Lords, I have come to this courtnot because I wish to discard a wife,but because such grave doubtsare cast upon my marriageand such grave fearsinvest my conscience.I do not wish to marry another womanfor carnal pleasure,or nor for any displeasureof the Queen's person or age.This court has been convenedto try the validity of that marriage.The bishops assembled herehave signed this documentdeclaring that the marriage is in doubtand must be resolved by trial.That is the truth,if it please Your Highness.No, Sir, that is not the truth. I do not give my consent. Wolsey.Your memory is failing with age, Bishop.We argued and in the end you agreedthat I should sign for youand affix your seal.My Lord, there is nothing more untrue.I told you I would neversupport this cause. Well, well, you're only one man.Continue.Hear the witnesseswho spoke with my brotherthe morning afterhe left the bedchamber.Are we to have no evidencebut bedroom sniggering and gossip?Get a message to the Queen.She should be here.She'll let her case go by default.I will hear the Queen.I will only be heard in Rome.I appeal to Rome.I appeal against all judges here.To Rome and to God I commit my cause.Catherine.Catherine!Proceed. I am going to adjourn. No, I beseech you, do not.I adjourn this court. You have the power. Use it. Power to hear the case, Your Majesty. But you've heard it, hours of it. From Your Majesty's witnesses.The Queen says no court in Englandcan be impartial.She appeals directly to Rome.But you are Rome come to England,My Lord.My hands are tied. The trial isadjourned for the Queen's appeal.To the Pope who fears the Queen's nephewmore than he loves the justice of God. Your Grace could be excommunicated! Get out!Limp back to Rome.Tell His Holiness I will havethe marriage Anneulled. Get out, get out.Get out!Well, My Lord Cardinal,so much for your boastful promises.Your Grace, forgive me.Forgive me.Go to the Queen.Banish her from the courtand house her at your own expensein some remote place.Yes, Your Majesty.Wolsey.Remove yourself from my sight.You're unfit for office.Render up the Great Seal.And hide, Wolsey.Hide from my anger.Go now. Go.Wolsey.I do not forgive you.I spare you for your past services.The business of the day is over, lawyer. I am a lawyer who has read the law. So?There is a law of this landthat says it is treasonto acknowledge any higher authoritythan the will of the King.It is, I take it, the will of the Kingthat he shall divorce the Queenand marry the Lady Annee?It is.Then the Church in Englandmust grant your will.It is treasonable to say that the Popeis a higher authority than the King......under the law.I’ve always been a defenderof the faith and of the Church.As matters stand,you are but half the King.To say that Rome may dictate this matteris to say that Rome may dictatethe succession to the Crown.What the King of England wants,he should havewithout hindrance from abroad.True. It is true.It would mean excommunication.It would mean a break with Rome.It would need only the appointment of anew Primate of the Church in England.He would grant the divorce.Yes. And the penalty for those good menwho could not stomach your law?The penalty for treasonhas always been death, Your Grace.You may go.There is something else, Your Majesty.Cardinal Wolsey,through skilful manipulation,has seen to itthat the monasteries of Englandare richer than the goldminesof the New World.If, as you should be, you become Headof the Church, those riches are yours.You're a man without scruple, lawyer.Entirely without scruple.I learned my trade underCardinal Wolsey, Your Grace.Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal?No, no, I studied under a real master,my father.Whatever villainy was lackingin the world when Henry VII was born,he invented before he left it.But the one cardinal principlehe taught me was,always keep the Church on your side.Well, you have the Church on one sideand you have me on the other.Yes. The choice is now clear.If I make myself Head of the Churchin England, I make you my Queen,I make myself wealthierthan all the monarchs in Europeand I shall be excommunicated.Everlasting damnation.No child of the Church shallspeak with me, feed me, shelter me.And when dead,my body shall lie without burialand my soul......shall be cast into hell forever.Heavenly Father,what I seek is not for myselfas You know,but for the future safety of my realmand the greater glory of Your name.If I weaken in my resolve,remember I am but a man.Give me Your heavenly strengthfor my intended journeyand resolve my doubts.My Lords,I intend to bring before Parliamentmatters which have concerned us greatly.I am deeply alarmed by the increasinginfluence and power in our Stateof the Church of Rome.Not content alone with misappropriationof property and money,Rome now seeks to interfere withthe laws and statutes of this realm.In particular, the King's prerogativesrelated to the succession to the throne.For all these reasonsand many others known to you allwe must free ourselvesfrom the interference, influenceand direction of the See of Rome.Hear, hear!Item. The Oath of Allegianceto the King of England sworn by you all.Item. The Oath of Allegianceto the Pope of Rome sworn by the Clergy.Question. Whom do the Clergy serve?Pope or King?Cardinal Wolsey, the greatest Churchmanof our land is cast down.Any bishop or priest who does notfirst serve the King will follow him.Parliament will be summonedfor the enactment of this billnamed The Act of Supremacy.The King is declared to be supremein matters of the welfare of subjects,both spiritual and temporal. Sire... My Lord Bishop, keep silent!There is only one questionI will put to this Council.No other will be tolerated or discussed.Does any Lord here,either spiritual or temporal,deny the right of Parliamentto make this the law of the landif Parliament so chooses?Sir Thomas More?I do not deny the right of Parliamentto enact laws.Good. Good. Master Cromwell. My Lord Chancellor?I regret, Master Cromwell,that you did not heed my advice.Concerning what?You have, I believe, told the King notwhat he ought to do, but what he can do.Now no man in the worldcan hold him.The King's power must be complete.And your own?To serve his.After today, I fear I must resign mine.Every man to the devil his own way.Forgive me, Your Majesty,I had meant to be gone.I fear I cAnneot rise.Cromwell, your hand.Get me on my feet.It’s the habit of a lifetime to seemyself that the inventory is completeand the keys are all ready,all labelled for you.I’m...I’m sorry to see you ill.Oh, no, My Lord.Your Majesty has taken from my shouldersa load that would sink a navy.Well, I’ll leave these and be gone.Is it... Is it for you, Mistress Annee,the palace? Yes. Yes, yes.It’s much too beautiful for an old man.It needs youth in it.There, take it.I’ve been your enemy,but I can't take it from you.Then I’ll leave it.A leggy girl and a halfgrown steer.What does that mean?Some friends of yoursare waiting to see you, Your Majesty.More, Fisher and Prior Houghton.It seemed urgent.Urgent for them.Send them in.I’ll tell them as I leave.Well, the country airwill do him good at Esher.The King will see you.Take heed, Sir Thomas.The King's passion for the ladyis blind to all reasonand past service.My Lord, for your wisdom,I am sorry to see you go.The King has gone beyond me.Through that one woman,I am lost forever.Do not neglect the King,but see to your own safety.It happensthat I have been unwell lately.Therefore I have given up my officeand shall leave the court and go home.There I will speak of nothingbut... domestic affairs.Well, God be with you.It is Pope or King,there is no other choice.For me it must be the Pope.I must follow my conscience.I cAnneot sign.Though I am sorry to lose old friends,you will die for it.There are hundreds of my Order who ingood conscience cAnneot take this oath.Must they all die?If they insist, they will.My cause is just.The English Church cut off from Romeis without an anchor.The only anchor I know is the King.The King had to choose,so must the Clergy.Well, Sir Thomas?I have come to say goodbye, Your Grace.I gave up my chain of office todayas you kindly permitted.And when that day comes when youhave to choose, will you sign the oath?I shall read the document with careand hope that my consciencewill permit me to sign, Your Grace.Goodbye... Thomas.Goodbye, My Lord.Goodbye, Prior John.You leave this world of your own will...and I am sad for it.Your Majesty, it will go on without us.And that is the last of themwho dare question.The rest will die silent.I think there has never been a kingwho gave so much to find his wayto the heart of the woman he loved.I have stabbed, fought and clawed my waythrough tissues of the Church and State.I’ve looted and plundered. I’ve rippedand torn the bodies of my friends.And all to come to this day.And yet, not once...Not once have you said, ""I love you"".Now, my Nan...My Nan will say it now.Yes.I do love you.No.No, that's not it.That's not what I meant. What more do you want, My Lord? I don't know.I don't know,but I still don't have you.Tell me, Nan,did someone some day say to you,never give in to him,never melt to him,never forget to hate him for a time,otherwise you'll lose him? I’ve said it to myself. And do you say so still? Yes. I see.I see.Keep your heart, then!Preserve your special chastity.I’m too old to suffer the longings,passions and frenzy of a stupid boy!Writing poems in the nightto the coldhearted bitch that I loveand tearing them up.Pacing up and down in my room,unable to sleep.Sons you have promised me whenyou are Queen, and sons I will have.Sons without love if I must.Enjoy your palace.I will not come near you againuntil the marriage day.Henry!I do love you.Henry, I love you.

A son.With that and your love I’d bethe King I’ve always wanted to be,wise, generous, just, merciful.So I’ll kill no man for you.It’s like a new age.Wildfire in the airand in the blood.Harry!The King sent for me to meet him here.Here?Perhaps he is jealous and testingmy faithfulness by bringing us together.Perhaps. Has he reason to be jealous? No. NeverWell, well. You're his concubine,I have a hag for a wife.Now I am to arrest Wolseywho began it all. Cold comfort. Arrest him? He's old and sick.

Pinch your cheeksand give them colour. Sit up and smile.Your are the Queen. Brazen it out.A girl this time, but a boythe next time. Do you hear me? Is she beautiful? Yes, she is.Give me the child.Give me my daughter.Is he well? Is he strong?My Lord...Those are lungs that will outbellowthe Spanish Ambassador. Ey, Nan?And the eyes. The eyes are clever.We'll call him Edward.It’s a lucky name for English Kings.I have borne you a daughter,Your Majesty. A daughter? Yes.Why did no one tell mebefore I entered?I wanted to tell you myself, Hal.We have a beautiful daughter.Next time, a son.Elizabeth.We shall call her Elizabeth. Is the child in good health? Perfect, Your Majesty.Good.Well, if we can have a healthy daughter,we can have a healthy son,as you say, as you... say.I’ll kiss you and leave you, Annee.God bless all here.Will you not kiss your daughter?My daughter?No. When she's older.When she has a brother. Still no word from the King? No, Your Majesty. No answer even to my letter? Nothing, Your Majesty.How can he so utterly forget so much?He does not forget, Mother.He just has no wish to remember.But rumours say thatall is not well with them.Still no sign of a son.That woman is in despair, they say.For already my beloved father's eyehas started to wander again.Poor Hal.Poor Hal. You pity him? Was I not his muchloved wife?And you are his daughter.Unless he has a son of a true marriage,you are his heir.You must be Queen.And remember,when I’m gone,you're first.Doctor! Quickly!Touch her and I’ll have hersent from court.Who?That halfwitted Seymour who is alwaysso tonguetied and blushing and adoring when you enter my chamber. She's a child. But you would get a child by her. But not by you, except a useless girl.Mind your tongue or I’ll have you sentfrom court to cool your temper, madam.Play on! Play!The Queen is tired, but does not wishto spoil your pleasure.Play!Jane.I...I think we shall dance well together.If I lead strongly,will you softly follow?I hope so, Your Grace.That little sheep won't hold theroyal bull beyond the first encounter.I order you!Leave us.Where is Jane Seymour?Cromwell tells me when the dance wasended, she was sent away under guard.She's on her way to Northumberland.As far away as I could send her,since we don't own Scotland.She has the face of a simpering sheep,and the mAnneers. But not the morals.I don't want her near me. You will bring her back! I think not!If you want her near you, find a placefor her in your palace at Whitehall.Whilst I am here,Jane Seymour must lie elsewhere.Tell her.Your Majesty, the people saythat you are the witch Queen.Are we ruled by superstition?Catherine still livesin the heart of the people.The people say that her daughteris the heir and yours the bastard.I do not fear the people.The people hate you, madam,for displacing Queen Catherineand tearing the Kingaway from the true Church.As they hate mefor despoiling the monasteries.But the King, they truly love.You and I, madam,live in the protection of the King.So?So in Parliament,which speaks for the people,there is a bill.It is called the Act of Succession.It makes your daughter the heirand Catherine's daughter, Mary,illegitimate.If the King does not wish it, theAct of Succession will not be passed.Would you sacrificethe child of our loveto get a silly little harlotbrought back to court?One daughter is much like another.I care not who's named bastardwhen I’m dead.If I bring Jane Seymour backyou will have Parliamentpass the Act of Succession?Yes.What a liar you are.What good is that Actunless every man in the kingdomwho has power to accept my childas legitimate heirfirst swears an oath of fealtyto you as Head of the Church?And if they do not, Act of Successionor no Act of Succession,they will say my child is the bastardand there's an end!Go.Nan, if you love me, don't defy me.Bring her back.I love you.I shall go to my grave loving you,no doubt, and hating you.I will bring her back to my courtif the oath is swornby all men of power, high and low.But those who refuse must die. You once said they must not die. You once said they must.And now so say I.Annee.Annee.If you love me, forget the succession.If you remember how it all came about,how can you look me in my eyesand say our daughter will not succeed?Because it would need unlimited murder.Nan, look at me.Is it fitting I should be Headof the Church, Pope and King at once,a farce so that so many men must die?Could you sign the death warrants?I’d sign ,rather than disinherit my blood!It’s that, or else it's my bloodand Elizabeth's.Cromwell knows that.Your butcher cleaver man knows that.Send him to implement these details,and let it be done quickly.High or low, they will sign.I wish I were loved, but I’m not.And yet I am Queen of this islandand Elizabeth also shall be Queen.For Elizabeth, no.For her I will not commit murder.Annee, if we had a male heir,your son and mine...I can be angrier than you've seen me.I know where your heart is, not with me.What has love got to dowith begetting of a king?I’m not young. I’m not true.I’m bitter. I’m envious.I’m dangerous. I’m malicious!It’s your misfortune that you love menow that I no longer love you.And yet, at this moment I want youbecause of the anger in your face and the spark of blood in your cheek. No.Annee, give me a princeand everything would be forgotten.No! Not unless you kill them,More and Houghton and Fisherand all who will not sign,not unless Elizabeth is your heir!I’ll kill them, then.I rob, murder and commit sacrilege...at your command.You do what you wishand call the deed mine.I hate you.I hate your desire and mine!I pray you, Master Kingston,see me safe up.As for my coming down,let me shift for myself.Good people, it has...The King's orders.You must not be heard.Well, then I will not speak.I die the King's good servant,but God's first.No!No! No! Well? A boy born dead.She has miscarried of her saviour.I am accursed!A live daughter and a dead son!Did I accept excommunication for this?Did I send More, Houghton and Fisherto their death for this?She cAnneot give me a living son!Very well, then.If she cAnneot give me a male heir,I shall rid myself of her.Sir, with Catherine's death,Annee is too firmly the Queen.Find a way. Find a legal way.I will divorce Annee.Divorce is like killing. After thefirst time, it doesn't seem difficult.Your Grace, we asserted English law.Annee is now Queen by English law.Indeed. Indeed.I divorced Catherine in good faith.But since that time, I have discoveredan impediment to my marriage to Annee.I had a child by her sister Mary.That, too, is incestuous.We used the incest excuse last time.We can't make a habit of it.Neither Pope nor Emperor willuphold her and the people hate her.She'd fight. Her sister was married. Youcouldn't prove it wasn't her husband's. Who do you serve? The King, Sir.Your Grace can't affordto start all that again.Then do you know another way?No, you! You tied me to her!Now you find a way to get rid of her!Perhaps......in her own life.Her life?Yes.Her marriage contract with Percy.He had her.That's it, you crawling toad.No, Your Grace, not her past life,the present. The rumours that she has a lover. Annee? A lover?I, a cuckold? Why, you're mad. If I could prove it?Invent it, you mean,with false evidence.Adultery is high treason.The penalty is death.Get out.Cromwell.It’s most kind of youto come, Master Smeaton.I am honoured.When invited to supper,I’m expected to sing for it. As you do for the Queen? Oh, that is my pleasure.She wishes me to be the firstmusic teacher to the Princess.Please, sit.No other guests.Thank you.Yes, for the Queen to makethe Princess your pupil,she must think most highly of you.Ah, the advantages of music.I did not knowthat music interested you.It doesn't.I am interested in the Queen,and you know her so well.Why, I’m merely a servant.I have the King's express ordersto protect the Queen's person.We have learned of threats.Oh, many hate her.I am dining you, as I will dine others,to get to know those whom I may trust.Oh, I see, I see.And it is true that she likesto have you close to her, is it not?Without boasting,I believe she prefers me to many.She prefers my style to the Italian.It is nearer to the mAnneershe loved in the French Court.She learned to lovelike a French woman.Yes, simple tunes sung with...You would be wiser not to laugh.It is a more valuable assetthan a pleasant singing voice.I make my way by singing. I’ve no desireto go any further by any other route.Come now.There are only two reasons for you to beconstantly in the Queen's apartments.You love her,or you are in the pay of Spain. Why, I go when I am sent for. To love or spy? Which?I’m sorry...Which?You're too simple to spy,I know that. So it is love. You love her. No! No!You do not love your Queen?Well, yes, all right, I do love her.As my Queen. And she loves you. No, Sir, of course not.Barton, come out here.Bring your papers.The last reply, but one.''Well, yes, all right, I do love her.'' What are you trying to make me say? The truth. That you are the Queen's lover. Oh, no.No! No! You first slept with her in February. I never! On the th of February. No!Surely you remembersuch an important date? No! Come, try to remember.No! No! No! Try! Yes!Yes! Yes! Yes!Anyone can walk,but can you walk with a train? Yes. All right, head up.Go on. Good!Don't look round. Go on.It will follow you like a kitten's tail.Oh, what a queen it will make some day. Enter. Madam, the Duke of Norfolk insists...Uncle! This is a rare honour nowadays.Leave us.Nan, brace yourself, girl.I have a warrant for your arrest.For my arrest?A poor joke.It’s not a joke, Annee.I could've let others do it,but I felt I could do it more gently.But I’m the Queen.How could I be arrested? For what?Adultery, it says here.Nonsense no doubt, but there it is.Adultery? With whom? Smeaton, Norris and others. I thought you were serious. I am.I am to take you to the Tower.There's to be a trial. I am to preside.But I’m the Queen.My child, she's the King's heir.Leave her with your women.Annee, you must come at once.Elizabeth!Annee.Down? Master Kingston,shall I be shut in a dungeon?No, madam. You will be lodgednear the room where you layon the night before your coronation.Oh, Jesus, have mercy on me.I am Lady Kingston, madam.I will wait upon you.Will you?Then go away. Leave me!I fear, madam, that she must stay.Every word spoken to youor by you must be reported.Send them away, Norfolk! Leave us. But...Leave us!Shall I ever be allowed to walk outand look at the sky?Shall I ever be free?Norris, Weston, his friends?His friends since I first met him? And they are accused with me? Yes.He is willing to kill themto get rid of me? To kill his closest friends? [man] Come on! The other way!My brother.Why have they arrested him?He also is accused of being your lover.Incest.Oh, God help me. The King is mad.I am doomed.Your Highness,you are accused of high treasonin that you, being the lawfullywedded wife of our Lord the King,did commit adultery.I ask that you answer my questions.By what lawful authorityam I called here?I am your Queen. And, as such, share theKing's immunity from arrest and trial.Norris, Weston, Smeaton and Breretonwere tried and condemned ten days ago.If they are guilty, then you are guilty. Did they plead guilty? They were found guilty.They were innocent as I am innocent!Any man, no matter who he is,who says the contrary is a liar!My Lord, the warrant of treasonwas issued by direction of the King.That is sufficient to give jurisdiction,however, so that there may be nopossibility of doubt as to her guilt, will My Lord call the first witness? Call the Earl of Rochford.George Boleyn, Earl of Rochford,come into court.The Earl of Rochford.Read the indictment.George Boleyn,you are accused of high treason,in that on certain days and dates,here specified,you did commit adulterywith Annee, Queen of England.Being your own sister in the flesh,an act of incest.No! Not true!It is not your turn to speak.How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?You are a foul liar,and my judges are your creatures.Stand up, Thomas Boleyn,Earl of Wiltshire. Come to the bar.Do you recognizethese two here accused,known as Annee and George Boleyn,as issue of your body? I do. Look at them, My Lord.By the same mother, Elizabeth Howard,daughter of the late Duke of Norfolk,and therefore full brother and sisterin the fleshso that their lying togetherwould be incest? Yes. For which the penalty is death.Proper evidence will be introducedlater. Remove the prisoner.That's all, My Lord.As father of the accused,you are excused your duty as a judgeand may leave.Present your next witness. Mark Smeaton, come into court. Mark Smeaton.My Lords, this manwas tried as a commoner.He confessed and was found guiltyof adultery with the Queenby a jury of his own order.He will give evidence against the Queen.Put your questions.Smeaton, did you have carnal relationswith the Queen?Smeaton, did you lie with the Queen?No.There is mercy only for thosethat tell the truth.Three men have been found guiltyon your evidence. Was that perjury?You confessed to your guiltknowing the penalty,knowing, unless the King is merciful,you will be hanged,cut down while you still live,disemboweled and your heart torn out!The King will not be mercifulif you lie! Did you have carnal relations? Yes!My Lord of Norfolk,may I question this man?I have not finished.Justice must be seen to be done,Master Cromwell. Proceed. Thank you, My Lord.Mark, look at me.I know well you have been tortured,but tell them the truth, Mark.Have courage. It is true. Write that. He says it is true.They have promised you your life,haven't they? If you lie for them?They will break the promise.It would not be safe to leave you alive. It’s true. He says it is true for a third time. We have our evidence. Poor gentle singer.Isn't it better, if you are to die,that you die with the truth?I am guilty!I was guilty with the Queen!Let me go now.She came to my bed...Let me go.She came to my bed, I swear it.Even when she tells him he will dieanyway, he still admits his guilt.Write that. Take him out.No. Wait.My husband, the King.Smeaton......how many timesdid the Queen come to your bed? Many times. When? I don't remember. You will remember.Call it to mind or you'll speakwith those who can jog your memory.Where did you couch with the Queen,my wife? York Place. That's a lie. It could never have happened there. No, no, it was at Windsor.She only went to Windsor with me.Can you think of no better lie?It was many places, it waswherever you like, whenever you like.Oh, God, help me. Let me go free.I’ll say whatever you like.Did Cromwell promise you your lifeif you said this? Answer me! Did he? Yes.He lied. Say what you like, Smeaton,and you will not live.Say what you like.Speak now without lying,for it will avail you nothing.I am to die?What happened between you and the Queen?Between us?Nothing.She was kind and pleasant and just.I would not hurt her.I lied because they have broken mewith ropes and ironsand then promised I would go free.Take him away.And yet......it could be true.For six years...This year and this......and this......and this......I did not love him.And then I did.Then I was his.I can count the days I was hisin hundreds.The days we bedded.Married.Were happy.Bore Elizabeth.Hated.Lusted.Bore a dead child......which condemned me......to death.In all......one thousand days.Just a thousand.Strange.And of those thousand, one,when we were both in love,only one,when our loves met and overlappedand were both mine and his.And when I no longer hated him,he began to hate me.Except for that one day.I’m not hungry.Take the food and leave me.Nan,is it true?Have you stepped into your own trap,My Lord?Any evidence you have against me,you yourself bought and paid for. Do you now begin to believe it? Annee.Annee, the court is still in sessionto decide your... verdict.I don't want to hear your guilt fromthem, I want to hear it from your lips. That I was unfaithful? Yes, just that.Were you unfaithful to mewhilst I still loved you?Of course, I’ll never know. Whetheryou say aye or no, I shall never know.You come here to make surewhether there was truly adulterybecause that would touchyour manhood or your prideand even so, my heart and my eyesare glad of you.Fool of all women that I am,I’m glad of you here.Go, then.Keep your pride of manhood,you know about me now.Nan, is it truethat you're glad to see me? Yes, it's true. Then, Annee,let's do all gently for old time's sake.I have no wish to harm you,and your words have moved me deeply.I must be free to have a son,and the son must be freeto rule England when I die.Why must you leave a king to follow you?Why not a queen?This country has never been ruledby a queen. It never could be.We can never have a son now,God has spoken.I must have a son elsewhere.And it's getting late.I’m not as young as I was.What do you want of me?Agree to Anneul the marriageand give up all rights.You shall go abroad and take Elizabethwith you. You will be well cared for.Please set me free.To marry Seymourand make our child a bastard?No. No. No.Nan... Nan, you leave me no choice!Once I told you any children we hadwould not be bastards.You promised marriage and the Crown.Now you try to dance outof your promise. Well, I won't have it!We are man and wife together.King and Queen. I keep that.Take it from me as best you can.Then you have decided, and so have I!Before you go,perhaps you should hear one thing.I lied to you.I said ''I love you'', but I lied.I was untrue. Untrue with many. That is a lie. It is true.I was unfaithful to youwith all of them.With half your court! With soldiersof your guard, grooms, stable hands.Look, for the rest of your life,at every man that ever knew meand wonder if I didn't find hima better man than you!You whore!But Elizabeth was yours.Watch her as she grows.She's yours. She's a Tudor.Get yourself a son on thatsweet pale girl if you canand hope that it will live.But Elizabeth shall reign after you.Yes! Elizabeth,child of Annee the whoreand Henry the bloodstained lecher,shall be Queen.You've asked for deathand you shall have it.So be it.Only what I take to my grave,you take to yours.And think of this, Henry.Elizabeth shall be a greater queenthan any king of yours.She shall rule a greater Englandthan you could ever have built.Yes! My Elizabeth shall be Queen.And my blood will have been well spent.She's lying.She was never unfaithful to me.She could. Any woman could.No. She lies.If she lies, let her die for lying.Let her die! Is everything ready? Yes, My Lord. The Queen is at prayer.Fetch her.The time for prayer is passed. And where is the King? At Richmond. Out hunting.Will you join him later?No, by God.For me there's killing enough this day.[executioner speaks French]Will it hurt?They say not, My Lady.The executioner from Franceis an expert with the sword.I hear that he is good.And I have a little neck.

No pennieson the eyes for anybody.You know, man, death isreally a hip thing now.Death is in. Books, magazine articles, TV shows... It's terrific!Ken and Barbie dollswho have a mutual suicide pact.Bury them in a little shoebox.Knew a guy who bought a pair.He was into doll necrophilia.If it cooks!All right, little thing!

Well, Michelle...uh, there are certain women who... Who...? Thanks a lot.Yeah.There are certain women who just...don't relate to men, so they...I think lesbian scenesare a big turnoff.You're right: I should've cut it. What's goin' on here? Never mind.

Would you stop that?Dr. Ballinger is looking at him now.Ballinger is the best there is, Audrey. Dr. Hyman, we just left him. About half an hour ago. And he seemed fine. Just fine.Well, he called. He said he hadchest pains. His left arm was numb.I'm bewildered myself.I checked him about a month ago.All right, who's in chargeof this allimportant...milliondollar show thatMr. Gideon keeps talking about?I guess I am.Mr. Gideon is having attacks of anginathat could lead to a massive coronary.Ah, shit! I gotta get back.I'm fine. What do doctors know?About angina, just a littlemore than show people.If you want to leave, fine, but Ithink you'll die. Can I see you?Dr. Hyman?The pain is gone. Nothing wrongwith me a rewrite wouldn't cure. Couple of good jokes is what I need. You can't leave now. Yes, I can. Damn it, Joe!Didn't you hearwhat the doctor just said?Please, stay.Joey, I've been talkingto Dr. Ballinger...Jonesy, wait a minute.Let me talk to the star here.If I stay, how much timeare we talking about?At least two or three weeks.You've got to be kidding!I got a show to put on!For chrissakes, will youtalk to these people?They don't understand anything!Oh, Jesus. What's wrong? Miss Collins. All right, easy. Damn it.You guys are doing this to me.I wasn't sick until I got here. What's wrong with him? It's exhaustion.You're lying to me.Yes.Uh, no, I'm not a memberof his immediate family.I'm, uh... I'm his girlfriend.Well, could I leave a messagefor him, please?Could you tell him that... Hello?It was just simply exhaustion.He just tried to do too much.Anyway...we've made a decision to postponethe show for four months. The doctors assured us Joe will be fine. There goes my new apartment.Therefore the show willdefinitely be done. I promise.Now, we're aware of the... financial burdens this might impose... I gave up a TV series. On some of you, and... What a dummy.We're prepared to try to get you...temporary jobs,or even lend you money.Jonesy, easy on the money,easy on the money.All right, Larry. All right, okay.We don't havea lot of cash available, but...what I'd like to say to you is...I... we...think of you all as family. Bullshit. And we want to do...everything we possibly can...to keep you all together.I was with him last night.Already he's much better.I just left him an hour ago.He was in a great mood...making jokes...making passes at all the nurses...and he told me to tell all ofyou he has a terrific idea... for a new hospital number. Hold it, Audrey!Hospital number, hospital number!Just give me a minute. Stan,will you give me some room? How does the title ""Hospital Hop"" grab you? It grabs me.Great, great. I think I got it. I got it! I think he's got it!Stan, help me out, please.Clap your hands!Cheer up!Let's go! Everybody!And Lucas...they are without questionan absolutely...marvelous cast.Now we gotta wait aroundfour months.Maybe even lose them.I can see where it'd be difficultto hold a cast like that together.It's really a shame.And, of course,even after four months...a heart attack...There's no guaranteethat he'll be able to work.None.Jules, it's still too bright. Take number seven down to five... And he's the greatest. And eight down to two. Hmm.And Lucas,I think we have a sure hit.A sure hit.Reads like a dream.I'd love to read it sometime.I'll get a copy to youthis afternoon.Oh, I forgot. Wait a minute.I've got one right here with me.Dimmer five up to three.Hold that. That's good.I know you couldn't care lessabout the money. Hmm? What do you think about this, Lucas?Is it any better?No. No, no.It needs to be more... shadowy.We talked about this, Jules.It's a seduction scene.Take the shadow lights to half.How much, uh... is Joe getting?Five percent of the grossuntil payoff.Then he goes to six percent. Twentypercent of subsidiary rights... including a movie sale. Thanks. That's good.Well...of course my schedule'simpossible, but, uh...you know how I feelabout you, Jonesy.You've been like a father to me.And you a son to me.I always look for theworst in people.A piece of you in them?Yeah.

I will.Mr. Gideon!Mr. Gideon, what are you doing?Oh, this?I was just getting rid of it.I caught someone smoking and toldhim a man in my condition...shouldn't even be around smoke.I'm telling you, Gideon,I got real insight into you.There's a deeprooted fearof being conventional.Right.Your blood pressureis higher than we hoped.Your cardiogramshaven't improved one bit.If you don't give a damn,it's hard to expect us to.Mr. Gideon!I'll leave these menus with you.Please check off what you wantfor the coming weeks, okay?Monday, I'll have roast beef. Tuesday,chicken. Wednesday, steak.Thursday I plan to be dead, so...I'll just have something light.Mr. Gideon!She wrote a little note on the back.She said you'd understand.""Dear loving, giving, generous""...underlined four times... ""Dad...I hear nurses are nice people.Hint, hint.Your poor, brotherless daughter.""Joe, what does it mean?It means she's inheritedher mother's determination.That's what it means.Oh, no. Thank you. No, no, no, no.You're wonderful, wonderful.The word ""superstar""...is greatly overusedin this business. Mm. But for my next guest...the word ""superstar""is totally inadequate.Whenever I do a benefit... and I'vedone , ,  this year...all for very worthy causes...I can always count on this dude...to be right there with me.I feel humbled in his presence.From deep, deep in here,ladies and gentlemen... let me lay on you...

I love show business.I'll go either way.I got insight into you, Gideon.You know what's underneath?The dreadful fearthat you're ordinary...not special.Right.I think...I think...I'm getting an erection.Oh, Mr. Gideon, don't...don't do that!That sex thing... Jesus!Listen, I wouldn't sayyou were a faggot...but you do have a lotof feminine characteristics.Right?Right.You are foolishly and childishlyflirting with disaster.Joe, what are you doing?You're really crazy! What doyou want to do, kill yourself?Dr. Ballinger told meto get a little exercise.Everything he does seems to bea denial of his condition.Dr. Ballinger, every time I'veseen him, I get the impression...that he doesn't carewhether he lives or dies.Yes, I know.But I think he cares a lot.Starting now, we'll limit hisvisitors to no more than two.Joe, I wish you couldhave been there.: this morning, before asingle review was out...the line at Cinema Onewas around the block.The people know.I mean, the people know!This broke every firstday record.It's a blockbuster. A blockbuster.I mean a blockbuster!And those guys in California...You wouldn't believethe telephone calls.""Congratulations,"" they say.""We're glad you took your time.It was worth it.Every dollar we put in that filmis up there on the screen.""I'm telling you, they're talking abouta $  / million advertising budget.Three and a half million dollars!I'm sorry. Excuse me.Do you believe that?Three and a half million dollars!This picture is goingright through the roof.Right through...the roof!Look at those reviews.See? We did it.Joe, we did it!Where are the bad ones?There are no bad ones.Josh.There were a couple that quibbleda little. I left them at the office.I want you to do me a favor:Don't show them to me.Never. How were the television reviews? I think we got Leslie Perry.At the screening,she told me she loved it.Following Joe Gideon's triumphantdirectorial achievement...with Fifty BeautifulGirls, Fifty...when he won every possible award...it would be nice to report thatMr. Gideon's latest effort...The Standup, starringDavis Newman...was a better film. Oh, boy. Here it comes. The Standup, however,does not quite stand up. Joey, turn it off, please. Leaning toward the frenetic, Gideon falls...into his characteristic weaknessof trying too hard... to please, to entertain. I'm gonna turn that off. Josh, no. I want to hear it. Slickness obscures reality. The old razzledazzle obliterates drama. What the hell does she know?She never gave anythinga good review.That woman is totally unqualifiedto criticize anything.She doesn't knowa goddamn thing about film. Or anything. She's not even reviewing a film.She's telling youhow clever she is!where the hasbeen comic, playedimpeccably by Davis Newman...demonstrateshis former brilliance...in a monologue where clearly...director Gideon gaveMr. Newman free rein.Rising aboverather commonplace material... the actor creates a classic comic aura... I don't care what she says.I guarantee this picture will do million domestic, at least. One of you better get somebody. What?I think I'm in trouble. I'll get somebody. ...chopping offends of scenesbefore the drama has played out...left this reviewerwith bewilderment...and a fouraspirin headache.Using my fourballoonrating system...I give The Standup half a balloon.

Apocalypse Now,1980,"Saigon,Shit,I'm still only in Saigon,Every time, I think I'm gonnawake up back in the jungle,When I was home after myfirst tour, it was worse,I'd wake up and there'd be nothing,I hardly said a word to my wifeuntil I said yes to a divorce,When I was here, I wanted to be there,When I was there, all I could thinkof was getting back into the jungle,I'm here a week now,Waiting for a mission,Getting softer,Every minute I stay inthis room, I get weaker,And every minute Charlie squatsin the bush, he gets stronger,Each time I looked around, thewalls moved in a little tighter,Everyone gets everything he wants,I wanted a mission,and for my sins, they gave me one,Brought it up to me like room service,Captain Willard, are you in there?Yeah, I'm coming.It was a real choice mission,And when it was over,I'd never want another,What do you want? Are you all right, captain? What does it look like? Are you Willard, th Battalion? Affirmative. rd Airborne? Yeah. Assigned to SOG? Hey, buddy, gonna shut the door?We have orders to escort you to the airfield. What are the charges? Sir? What did I do? There's no charges, captain.You have orders to report toCOMSEC Intelligence at Nha Trang.Now, you see? All right? Nha Trang, for me? That's right.Come on, captain. You still havea few hours to get cleaned up. I'm not feeling too good. Captain?Dave, come here and give mea hand. We got a dead one.Come on, captain. Let's take a shower. Don't be an asshole. Get ahold of him good.We're gonna take a shower, captain. In we go.Stand underneath this, captain.I was going to the worst place in the worldand I didn't even know it yet,Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a riverthat snaked through the warlike a main circuit cable,plugged straight into Kurtz,It was no accident thatI got to be the caretakerof Colonel Walter E, Kurtz's memoryany more than being backin Saigon was an accident,There is no way to tell hisstory without telling my own,And if his story is really a confession,Captain Willard reporting, sir.Then so is mine, Captain. Good. Come on in. Thank you, sir.Stand at ease.General.Do you want a cigarette?No, thank you, sir.Captain, have you everseen this gentleman before? No, sir. Met the general or myself?No, sir. Not personally.You've worked a lot on yourown, haven't you, captain?Yes, sir, I have.Your report specifiesintelligence, counterintelligencewith COMSEC I Corps.I'm not presently disposed todiscuss those operations, sir.Did you not work for the CIA in I Corps?No, sir.Did you not assassinate agovernment tax collector,Quang Trí Province, June , ?Captain?Sir, I am unaware of anysuch activity or operation.Nor would I be disposed todiscuss such an operationif it did in fact exist, sir.I thought we'd have a biteof lunch while we talk.I hope you brought a good appetite, captain.I noticed that you have a......bad hand there. Are you wounded?I had a little fishingaccident on R and R, sir. Fishing on R and R. Yes, sir.But you're feeling fit?You're ready for duty?Yes, general. Very much so, sir.Well, let's see what we have here.Roast beef, and usually it's not bad.Try some, Jerry, and pass it around.To save a little time,we might pass both ways.Captain, I don't know howyou feel about this shrimp,but if you'll eat it, you'll never haveto prove your courage in any other way.Actually, why don't I just take a piece here.Captain, you've heard ofColonel Walter E. Kurtz?Yes, sir, I've heard the name.Oh, Jesus.Operations officer, th Special Forces.Luke, would you play thattape for the captain, please? Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. Listen to this carefully, captain.October ,  hours,sector Peter, Victor, King,These were monitored out of Cambodia.This has been verifiedas Colonel Kurtz's voice.I watched a snailcrawl along the edgeof a straight razor,That's my dream,It's my nightmare,Crawling, slitheringalong the edge......of a straight razor......and surviving,Transmission , received', December ,  hours,Sector King, Zulu, King,But we must kill them,We must incinerate them,Pig after pig,Cow after cow,Village after village, Army after army,And they call me an assassin,What do you call it when theassassins accuse the assassin?They lie,They lie, and we have to be mercifulfor those who lie,Those nabobs,I hate them,I do hate them,Walt Kurtz was one of themost outstanding officersthis country's ever produced.He was brilliant. He wasoutstanding in every way.And he was a good mantoo. A humanitarian man.A man of wit and humor.He joined the Special Forces.And after that......his ideas, methods......became......unsound.Unsound.Now he's crossed into Cambodia with thisMontagnard army of his thatworship the man like a godand follow every order, however ridiculous.Well, I have some othershocking news to tell you.Colonel Kurtz was about to bearrested for murder.I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?Kurtz had ordered the execution ofsome Vietnamese intelligence agents,men he believed were double agents.So he took matters into his own hands.Well, you see, Willard,in this war, things get......confused out there.Power, ideals, the old moralityand practical military necessity.But out there with these natives,it must be a temptation to......be God.Because there's a conflictin every human heartbetween the rational and the irrational,between good and evil,and good does not always triumph.Sometimes......the dark sideovercomes what Lincoln called""the better angels of our nature. ""Every man has got a breaking point.You and I have them.Walt Kurtz has reached his......and very obviously, he has gone insane.Yes, sir. Very much so,sir. Obviously insane.Your mission is to proceed up theNung River in a Navy patrol boat,pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Bha,follow it, learn what you can along the way.When you find the colonel,infiltrate his teamby whatever means available,and terminate the colonel's command.Terminate the colonel.He's out there operatingwithout any decent restraint,totally beyond the pale of any acceptablehuman conduct,and he is still in thefield, commanding troops.Terminate with extreme prejudice.You understand, captain, thatthis mission does not exist,nor will it ever exist.How many people had I already killed?There were those six thatI knew about for sure......close enough to blowtheir last breath in my face,But this time, it was an American......and an officer,That wasn't supposed tomake any difference to me,but it did,Shit,Charging a man with murder in this placewas like handing out speedingtickets at the Indy ,I took the mission,What the hell else was I gonna do?But I really didn't knowwhat I'd do when I found him,Did you check the tank?Yeah.I was being ferried downthe coast in a Navy PBR,a type of plastic patrol boat, apretty common sight on the rivers,They said it was a goodway to pick up informationand move without drawing a lotof attention, and that was okay,I needed the air and the time,Only problem was I wouldn't be alone,Morning, captain.The crew were mostly just kids,rock 'n' rollers withone foot in their graves, How old are you? Seventeen.The machinist, the one theycalled Chef, was from New Orleans,He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam,Probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans,Lance, on the forwards, was a famous surferfrom the beaches south of L, A,Clean, Mr, Clean, was fromsome South Bronx shithole,and I think the lightand the space of Vietnamreally put the zap on his head,Then there was Phillips, the chief,It might have been my mission, butit sure as shit was the chief's boat,There's about two pointswhere we can draw enough waterto get into the Nung River.They're both hot. Belong to Charlie.Don't worry about it.Don't smoke.You know, I've pulled afew special ops in here.About six months ago,I took a man who was goingup past the bridge at Do Lung.He was regular Army too.Heard he shot himself in the head.Good morning, Vietnam,I'm Army Specialist Zack Johnson on AMVN,It's about  degrees in downtownSaigon right now, also very humid,And we have an important message for all Glswho are living offbasefrom the mayor of Saigon,Yeah!He'd like you to hang your laundryindoors instead of on the windowsills,The mayor wants you to keep Saigon beautiful,Here's another blast from the pastgoing out to Big Sam, who'salone in the mantle room out therewith the  st Battalion, thInfantry, and dedicated by the fire teamat An Khe to their groovy CO Fred the Head; The Rolling Stones' ""Satisfaction,"" All right!Watch out, Clean!Get down, bubba!Hang on, Lance!Get down, bubba!Tell them you did it,Lance. Tell them you did it.I see you is right on target today, baby.Work out! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!All right!Look out, Lance!At first, I thought theyhanded me the wrong dossier,I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead,Thirdgeneration WestPoint, top of his class,Korea, airborne, abouta thousand decorations,et cetera, et cetera,I'd heard his voice on the tapeand it really put the hook in me......but I couldn't connectup that voice with this man,Like they said, he had an impressive career,Maybe too impressive,I mean, perfect,He was being groomed for one ofthe top slots in the corporation,General, chief of staff, anything,In , he returned from a tourwith Advisory Command in Vietnam,and things started to slip,His report to the Joint Chiefs ofStaff and Lyndon Johnson was restricted,Seems they didn't digwhat he had to tell them,During the next few months, hemade three requests for transferto airborne training, Fort Benning,Georgia, and was finally accepted,Airborne?He was  years old,Why the fuck would he do that?, joins Special Forces,returns Vietnam,Hey, what's that? Arc Light. What's up? Bstrike.  Yeah? What's that? Arc Light.I hate that. Every time I hearthat, something terrible happens.Charlie don't never seethem or hear them, man.There they are.The concussion will suck theair out of your damn lungs.Something terrible is gonna happen.Smoke!Secondary burning.Hueys over there.

A whimper.And with a whimper, I'mfucking splitting, jack.On the river, I thought thatthe minute I looked at himI'd know what to do,But it didn't happen,I was in there with him for daysnot under guard,I was free,But he knew I wasn't going anywhere,He knew more about what Iwas going to do than I did,If the generals back in NhaTrang could see what I saw,would they still want me to kill him?More than ever, probably,And what would his people backhome want if they ever learnedjust how far from them he'd really gone?He broke from themand then he broke from himself,I'd never seen a man so broken upand ripped apart,I've seen the horrors.Horrors that you've seen.But you have no right to call me a murderer.You have a right to kill me.You have a right to do that.But you have no right to judge me.It's impossible for words......to describe......what is necessary......to those......who do not know......what horror means.Horror.Horror has a face.And you must make a friend of horror.Horror and moral terrorare your friends.If they are not,then they are enemies to be feared.They are truly enemies.I remember when I was with Special Forces.Seems a thousand centuries ago.We went into a camp to inoculate......some children.We'd left the campafter we had inoculatedthe children for polio.And this old man came runningafter us and he was crying.He couldn't see.We went back thereand they had come and hacked offevery inoculated arm.There they were in a pile.A pile of......little arms.And I remember...I... I... I cried. I wept like......some grandmother.I wanted to tear my teeth out. Ididn't know what I wanted to do.And I wanna remember it.I never wanna forget it.I never wanna forget.And then I realized,like I was shot...Like I was shot with a diamond...A diamond bullet right through my forehead.And I thought, ""My God, the genius of that.The genius.The will to do that.Perfect, genuine, complete,crystalline, pure. ""Then I realized,they were stronger than mebecause they could stand it.These were not monsters. These were men,trained cadres.These men who fought with their hearts,who have families, who have children,who are filled with love.That they had the strength...The strength......to do that.If I had ten divisions of those men,then our troubles herewould be over very quickly.You have to have men......who are moral......and at the same time who are able to......utilize their......primordial instincts to kill......without feeling, without passion......without judgment. Without judgment.Because it's judgment that defeats us.I worry that my sonmight not understand what I've tried to be.And if I were to be killed, Willard,I would want someone to go to my homeand tell my son everything.Everything I did, Everything you saw,Because there's nothing that I detest morethan the stench of lies,And if you understand me, Willard, you...You will do this for me,PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty, Over,PBR Street Gang, this isAlmighty standing by, Over,PBR Street Gang, this is Almightystanding by, How do you copy?They were gonna make me a major for this,and I wasn't even intheir fucking Army anymore,Everybody wanted me to do it,Him most of all,I felt like he was up therewaiting for me to take the pain away,He just wanted to go out like a soldier,standing up,Not like some poor,wasted, ragassed renegade,Even the jungle wanted him dead,And that's who he reallytook his orders from anyway,""We train young men to drop fire on people,but their commanderswon't allow them to write 'fuck'on their airplane,because......it's obscene. ""The horror.The horror.Calling PBR Street Gang,PBR Street Gang, this isAlmighty, Do you read me? Over,PBR Street Gang?PBR Street Gang, this is Almighty...The horror,The horror,"

Maybe.Mr Hopkins you may agreewith him thinking""Yes we should simply studyour Mr Pritchard...""and learn our rhyme and metreand go quietly about the business...of achieving other ambitions.""I have a little secret for you.Huddle up.Huddle up!We don't read and writepoetry because it's cute.We read and write poetry becausewe are members of the human race.And the human raceis filled with passion.Medicine lawbusiness engineering:these are noble pursuitsand necessary to sustain life.But poetrybeauty romance love these are whatwe stay alive for.To quote from Whitman.:""O me O life of the questionsof these recurring.""Of the endless trainsof the faithless.""Of cities filledwith the foolish.""What good amid theseO me O life?""Answer:That you are here.""That life existsand identity.""That the powerful playgoes onand you may contributea verse.""""That the powerful playgoes onand you may contributea verse.

What was the Dead Poets Society?I doubt the present administrationwould look too favourably upon that.Why?What was it? Gentlemen can you keep a secret? Sure.The Dead Poets were dedicatedto sucking the marrow out of life.That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invokeat the beginning of every meeting.You see we would gatherat the old Indian cave...and take turns reading from ThoreauWhitman Shelley  the biggies.Even some of our own verse.And in the enchantment of the momentwe'd let poetry work its magic.You mean it was a bunch of guyssitting around reading poetry?No Mr Overstreet.It wasn't just guys.We weren't a Greek organization.We were romantics.We didn't just read poetry we let itdrip from our tongues like honey.Spirits soared women swoonedand gods were created gentlemen.Not a bad wayto spend an evening eh?Hmm.Thank you Mr Perryfor this stroll down amnesia lane.Burn that.Especially my picture.Dead Poets Society.What?

Would you?My name is Lester Burnham.This is my neighborhood.This is my street.This is my life.I'm  years old.In less than a year, I'll be dead.Of course, I don't know that yet.And in a way, I'm dead already.Look at me:jerking off in the shower.This will be the high point of my day.It's all downhill from here.That's my wife, Carolyn.See the way the handle on those pruning shearsmatches her gardening clogs?That's not an accident.Hush, Bitsy! Hush. What is wrong with you? That's our nextdoor neighbor, Jim.And that's his lover, Jim. You spoil her. Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now. Me? Come on. Yes. Inside. Good morning, Jim!Good morning, Carolyn.I love your tie! That color!I just love your roses.How do you get them to flourish like this?Well, I'll tell you:eggshells and MiracleGro. I've never heard that. Man, I get exhausted just watching her.She wasn't always like this.She used to be happy.We used to be happy.My daughter Jane. Only child.Janie's a pretty typical teenager:angry, insecure, confused.I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass,but I don't want to lie to her.Jane, honey, are you tryingto look unattractive? Yes. Congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.Lester, could you make me a little later, please,because I'm not quite late enough.Nice going, Dad.Both my wife and daughterthink I'm this gigantic loser.And they're right.I have lost something.I'm not exactly sure what it is,but I know I didn't always feel this...sedated.But you know what?It's never too late to get it back.Hello. This is Lester Burnhamfrom Media Monthly magazine.I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please.Well, we're all under a deadline here.You see, there's some basic information...about your product launch that isn'teven covered in your press release, and I'd...Yeah, c... can I ask you a question?Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.Yeah. Okay. I'll leave my number.It's .Lester Burnham. Thank you!Hey, Les. You got a minute?For you, Brad, I got five!So, yeah, I'm sure you can understandour need to cut corners around here.Oh, sure. Times are tight.You got to free up some cash.You got to spend money to make money. Right? Exactly.Like the time that Mr. Flournoy usedthe company MasterCard to pay for that hooker,and she used the card numbers and stayedat the St. Regis for, what was it, three months? That's unsubstantiated gossip. That's $,. That's somebody's salary.That's somebody who's going to get firedbecause Craig has to pay women to fuck him!Jesus!I mean, calm down.Nobody's getting fired yet.That's why we're having everyone...write out a job description mappingout in detail how they contribute.That way managementcan assess who's valuable...And who's expendable.It's just business.I've been writing for this magazine for  years. You've been here how long? A whole month? I'm one of the good guys, Les.I'm trying to level with you.This is your one chance to save your job.There is no decision.You just write the damn thing. You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist? Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed. All right.Let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan'cause it's more convenient that way.Oh, could you be a little bitmore dramatic, please, huh?So, we finally got new neighbors.You know, if the Lomans had let me represent theminstead of the Real Estate King,that house would never have saton the market for six months.Well, they were still mad at youfor cutting down their sycamore.Their sycamore? Come on.A substantial portion of the root structurewas on our property.You know that.How can you call it their sycamore?I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down somethingif it wasn't partially mine, which, of course, it was.Bali Ha'iThey call youMom, do we always have to listento this elevator music?No. No, we don't.And as soon you've prepared a nutritiousyet savory meal that I'm about to eat,you can listen to whatever you like.So, Janie, how was school?It was okay.Just okay?No, Dad. It was spectacular.Well, you want to knowhow things went in my job today?They've hired this efficiency expert,this really friendly guy named Brad...How perfect is that? And he's basically thereto make it seem they're justified...in firing somebody, because they couldn'tjust come out and say that, could they?No, no. That would just be too honest.So they've asked us...You couldn't possibly care less, could you?What do you expect?You can't all of a sudden be my best friendjust because you had a bad day.I mean, hello, you've barelyeven spoken to me for months.Oh, what? You're ""Mother of the Year""? You treat her like an employee. What?What?I'm going to get some ice cream.Janie...I'm sorry I haven't been more available.I'm just... I...You know, you don't alwayshave to wait for me to come to you.Oh, great. So now it's my fault?I didn't say that.It's nobody's fault.

Solved. I mean, I think ""lagoon,"" I think waterfall, tropical.This is a cement hole.Uh...I have some tiki torches in the garage.Shut up! Stop it! You weak... You baby!Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!Who are you looking for?My parents are coming tonight.They're trying to, you know,take an active interest in me.Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.They're such assholes.Why can't they just have their own lives?What makes you sure she wants us to be there?Did she ask us to come?Of course not. She doesn't want us to knowhow important this is to her.But she's been practicing for weeks.I'll bet she's going to resent it,and I'm missing the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.Lester, this is important. I'm sensinga real distance growing between you and Jane.""Growing""? She hates me. She's just willful. She hates you too. Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry. Pardon me.Hi!

I'll be seeing you around, then.Could he be any more... pathetic?I think he's sweet.And I think he and your motherhave not had sex in a long time.It's the weirdest thing.I feel like I've been in a comafor about  years...and I'm just now waking up.Spectacular.I'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.That's okay.I'm used to guys drooling over me.It started when I was about .I'd go to dinner with my parents.Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.Every guy there would stare at mewhen I walked in.And I knew what they were thinking,just like I knew guys at schoolthought about me when they jerked off. Vomit. No. I liked it.I still like it. If people I don't even knowlook at me and want to fuck me,it means I really have a shotat being a model.Which is great,because there's nothing worse in lifethan being ordinary.I really think it'll happen for you.I know.Because everything that was meant to happen,does... eventually.Asshole.Hello?

You've only been in Seventeenonce, and you looked fat.So stop acting like you'regoddamn Christy Turlington!Cunt!I am so sick of peopletaking their insecurities out on me. Oh, my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night. Him?Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic. Do you know him? Yeah.We were on the same lunch shiftwhen I was in ninth grade,and he would always savethe most random, weird things.And then one day, he was just,like, gone.And then Connie Cardullo told me that his parentshad to put him in a mental institution.Why? What did he do?What do you mean?Well, they can't put you awayjust for saying weird things.You total slut.You've got a crush on him. What? Please! You are defending him. You love him.

I'm just curious.What a freak.And why does he dresslike a Bible salesman?He's, like, so confident.That can't be real.I don't believe him.I mean, he didn't even, like,look at me once. How'd you get in the Army? Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love my country.And third, they nailed me.Hey. What's going on here? Bend all the way down. Here comes the Bull of the Woods.I'm sorry. What?Mom, nobody said anything.Oh. I'm sorry.Everyone here is with their spouseor significant other. How would it look if I showed up with no one? You always end up ignoring me.Now, listen to me.This is an important business function.As you know, my businessis selling an image,and part of my job is to live that image.Honey, do me a favor and say whatever you want to sayand spare me the propaganda.All right.

Urine.I have to take a drug test every six monthsjust to make sure I'm clean.Are you kidding?You just smoked with me last night.It's not mine.One of my clients is a nursein a pediatrician's office.Cut her a deal,she keeps me in clean piss.You like Pink Floyd?I like a lot of music.Man, I haven't listened to this album in years.How much do you want?I don't know. It's been a while.Um, how much is an ounce?This is totally decent, and it's .This shit is top of the line.It's called G.It's genetically engineered by the U.S. government.It's extremely potent,but a completely mellow high.

Lester!You have such hostility in you.Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here.Unless... you want to spot me.Lester, you will not get away with this. You can be sure of that. There are many here among us That's... what... Who feel that life is but a jokeyou... think.""My job consists of basically masking...""my contempt for the assholes in charge...""and at least once a dayretiring to the men's room...""so I can jerk off...""while I fantasize about a life...that doesn't so closely resemble hell.""Well, you obviously have no interestin saving yourself.Brad, for  years, I've been a whorefor the advertising industry.The only way I could save myself nowis if I start firebombing.Whatever. Management wants you goneby the end of the day.Just what sort of severance packageis management prepared to offer me,considering the informationI have about our editorial director...buying pussy with company money?Which I think would interest the I.R.S.,since it technically constitutes fraud.And I'm sure that some of our advertisersand rival publications...might like to know about it as well,not to mention... Craig's wife. What do you want? One year's salary with benefits.That's not going to happen.What do you say I throw ina little sexual harassment charge to boot?Against who?Against you.Can you prove that youdidn't offer to save my job...if I let you blow me?Man... you are one twisted fuck.Nope.

I'm so sorry.Yes. According to her, I'm...too focused on my career.As if being driven to succeed is...some sort of a character flaw.Well, she certainly did take advantageof the lifestyle my success afforded her.It's for the best.When I saw you two at the party the other night,you seemed perfectly happy.Well, call me crazy,but it is my philosophythat in order to be successful,one must project an image of success...at all times.What are you doing? I was filming this dead bird. Why?Because it's beautiful.I think maybe you forgot your medication today,mental boy.Hi, Jane.Look, I want you to stop filming me.Okay.Well, whatever.

It's just for counter. Good.I'm looking for the leastpossible amount of responsibility.I don't think you'd fit in here.I have fast food experience.Yeah, like  years ago.I'm sure there've been amazingtechnological advances in the industry,but surely you must havesome sort of training program.It seems unfair to presumeI won't be able to learn.That was exactly what I needed...the ""royal treatment,"" so to speak.I was so stressed out.Know what I do when I feel like that?What? I fire a gun. Really?Oh, yeah. I go to thislittle firing range downtown,and I... just pop off a few rounds. I've never fired a gun before. Well, you've gotta try it.Nothing makes you feel more powerful.Well...almost nothing. So, do you like your new house? I like it.The people who used to live therefed these stray cats, so they were always around,and it drove my mother nuts.And then she cut down their tree.Is that a funeral?Yeah. Have you ever knownanybody who died?No. Have you?No.But I did see this homeless womanwho froze to death once...just laying there on the sidewalk.She looked really sad.I got that homeless woman on videotape.Why would you film that? Because it was amazing. What's amazing about it?When you see something like that,it's like God is looking right at you,just for a second,and if you're careful,you can look right back.And what do you see?Beauty.Mom, I want you to meet somebody. Mom. Yes?I want you to meet somebody.This is Jane. Hi. Oh, my.I apologize for the waythings look around here.This is where my dad hides out.I take it he's got a thing for guns.You gotta see this one thing.My dad would kill meif he knew I was in here.Did you steal his keys?No. One of my clients is a locksmith.He was short on cash one night,so I let him pay me in trade.Turn it over.Oh, my God.It's, like, official state chinaof the Third Reich.There's a whole subculture of peoplewho collect this Nazi shit.But my dad just has this one thing. What's wrong? Nothing.No, you're scared of me.No, I'm not.You want to see the most beautiful thingI've ever filmed?It was one of those days...where it's a minute away from snowing,and there was this electricity in the air.You can almost hear it.Right?And this bag was just...dancing with me,like a little kidbegging me to play with it,for  minutes.That's the day I realizedthat there was this...entire life behind things...and this incredibly benevolent force...that wanted me to knowthat there was no reason to be afraid...ever.Video's a poor excuse, I know,but it helps me remember.I need to remember.Sometimes there's so much...beauty...in the world.I feel like I can't take it...and my heart...is just going to...cave in.Oh, my God. What time is it? Sorry I'm late. No, that's quite all right, dear.Your father and I were just discussinghis day at work.Why don't you tell our daughterabout it, honey?Janie, today I quit my job.Then I told my boss to go fuck himself,and then I blackmailed him for almost $,. Pass the asparagus. Your father seems to think...this kind of behavioris something to be proud of.And your mother seems to preferthat I go through life like a fucking prisoner...while she keeps my dickin a Mason jar under the sink.How dare you speak to methat way in front of her?And I marvel that you can beso contemptuous of me...on the same day that you lose your job!I didn't lose it. It's not like,""Whoops, where did my job go?""I quit! Pass the asparagus.Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank youfor putting me under the added pressure...of being the sole breadwinner now. I already have a job. No, no!Don't give a second thoughtas to who's going to pay the mortgage.We'll leave it up to Carolyn.""You're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn?""""Yes. I don't mind.""""Everything? You don't mindhaving the sole responsibility?Your husband feels he can justquit his job, and you don't...""Will someone please pass methe fucking asparagus?

The Cider House Rules,2000,"In other parts of the world,young men leave home andtravel far and wide...in search of a promising future.Their journeys are often fuelledby dreams of triumphing over evil,finding a great love...or the hope offortunes easily made.Here in St. Cloud's, not even the decisionto get off the train is easily made,for it requires an earlier,more difficult decision...add a child to your lifeor leave one behind.The only reason people journeyhere is for the orphanage. Good morning. We have an appointment.Yes. Come in. Welcome to St.Cloud's.We're going rightupstairs to see Dr Larch.I came as a physician tothe abandoned children...and unhappily pregnant women.I had hoped to become a hero.But in St. Cloud's, therewas no such position.In the lonely, sordidworld of lost children,there were noheroes to be found.And so I became thecaretaker of many,father of none.Well, in a way, there was one.Here he is.His name was Homer Wells.I named him afterthe Greek writer.You know, Homer, of course?And I made his name Wellsbecause I could tell he was...very deep.In truth, NurseAngela named him.Her father drilled wells, and sheonce owned a cat named Homer.Byebye, Homer. Good night, you Princes of Maine, Can we see the doctor?You Kings of New England. Good night. Doctor?Doctor? There's somethingwrong with him. He never makes a sound. He didn't cry.Orphan babies learnthere's no point in it.Do you think we could have a lookat someone a little different?Thus was Homer Wells returned.He was too happy a baby.Bye, Homer.The second family to adopt him had agift for getting sounds out of Homer.They beat him.He couldn't stop crying.Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.It's okay now.Nobody's gonna hurt you any moreHere in St. Cloud's, I try to considerwith each rule I make or break...that my first priorityis an orphan's future.Twice adopted, twice returned.It didn't bode well.And yet it was always clear tome that he was a special boy.Near the angle of the rib.And... It was with Homer's future in mind... Homer? That I began his tutorials. If you're going to stay at St. Cloud's,I expect you to be of use.I admit that ourlessons were, in part, the simple expression of a father's love. Homer.But in failing towithhold love...and making theorphanage his home,had I created a true andeverlasting orphan? No! Keep breathing. You're gonna be okay.And so my excellent pupil learnedto look after abandoned children... and to deliver unwanted babies. Relax!Long ago, I had decidedthat sometimes...it was the women whoneeded to be delivered.I chose my own path.No one would everchoose for Homer Wells.I saw the splendourof the moonlightOn Honolulu BayThere's somethingtender in the moonlightOn Honolulu BayAnd all the beachesare full of peachesWho bring their youth alongAnd in the glimmerof the moonlightThey love to sing this songIf you like the Ukulele Lady Ukulele Lady like you Dr Larch!Dr Larch!Dr Larch?We have two new patients. One to deliver. Coming. First pregnancy? Yes, for both.I presume you'd preferhandling the delivery?All I said was, I don'twanna perform abortions.I have no argument withyou performing them.You know how to help these women.How can you not feel obligated...to help them when they can'tget help anywhere else?One: It's illegal. Two: I didn't askhow to do it. You just showed me.What else could I have shown you, Homer? Theonly thing I can teach you is what I know.In any life, youhave to be of use.Of use? Of use.That was good, Carla. That was perfect.Everything's gonna be fine. I don't wanna see it. You don't have to see it, dear. Don't worry.I don't even wanna know whatsex it is, so don't tell me! We won't tell you. You're gonna be okay. Your baby's gonna be okay too. I don't wanna know! That's a big boy.Let me see him.I wanna see him. Would you mind joining me in the nursery?

What's an immigrant?Someone not from Maine.Let us be happy for Hazel.Hazel has found a family.Good night, Hazel.Good night, Hazel.I was dreaming about you.How beautiful you were. Ah, you weren't. I was. And I was beautiful? You were.You are.It was fantastic.It was just the ether, Wilbur. Hi. Hey, Eddie, look at this. Homer, do you ever think about trying to find your parents? Not really.Why not?Well, they never did the thingsparents are supposed to do.Dr Larch did those things andNurse Edna and Nurse Angela.Well, I wish I could meetmine anyway, sometimes.What for?Well, I'd like to show 'emthat I could cook a little. Mmhmm. And...that I could drive a truck.Mmhmm.Sometimes I wanna meet them so I cankill them. Just sort of kill them.You know I'd neverkill anyone, right? Mmhmm. I know. Get away!Get the hell off of me!I think Mary Agnescould kill someone. What the hell do you think you're doing? I don't think so.No, she's... she's justan emotional girl.What's she so emotional about?She got left here like therest of us, didn't she?Throw it to Copperfield.I go first.I'll be on Buster's team.Look!Her temperature is .Scoot down.Come on. Good girl. That's a girl.Little more.Dear child, it won't hurt when I look.I'm just gonna look.All right.Dear child, did you, uh,do something to yourself?It wasn't me. It wasn't me. Did you go to someone else? He said he was a doctor. I would never have stuck that inside of me. It wasn't me. Listen, you've been very brave. I'm going to put you to sleep. It wasn't me.Homer, I want you to see this.You won't feel it any more.You've been very brave.We'll make it deep. You sure? You bet.The fetus is unexpelled.Her uterus is punctured.She has acute peritonitis, andthere's a foreign object.I think it's a crochet hook.Take this.If she had come to you four monthsago and asked for a simple D&C,what would you have done?Nothing! This is whatdoing nothing gets you.It means that somebody else is gonna dothe job, some moron who doesn't know how.I wish you'd have cometo me, dear child.What did she die of?She died of secrecy. She died of ignorance. Oh.Homer, if you expect people to beresponsible for their children,you have to give them the right todecide whether or not to have children. Wouldn't you agree? How about expecting people to be responsible enough...to control themselvesto begin with?How about this child? Youexpect her to be responsible?I'm not talking about her.I'm talking about adults.You know who I mean. What? It's just... It's just a marvel to me...that you still have suchhigh expectations of people. I'm happy I amuse you. Look at it this way.What choice does Buster have?What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. Look at it this way.Buster and I are sitting here right beside you.We could have ended up in the incinerator.Happy to be alive under any circumstances.Is that your point?Happy to be alive?Yeah, I guess so. You're it. Pass it over here. So many children. Are they all orphans? Well, it is an orphanage. Who wants chocolate? I want some chocolate.Hi. Okay.They're getting in the car.Watch your fingers.Hi.

Thank you.Are you okay?Yeah. I think it was the ether.Oh, the... That smellmust've got to me.Oh, God, this is all my fault.Homer, Steerforth got into the pantry.He's eaten all the pie dough. He wasn't sharing it either. He's down the hall throwing up. He's such a pig. Don't call him a pig. It's not nice to call people names.But he is a pig.What kind of planesdo you fly in?AB Liberator.Oh. Liberator.You enlisted?They wouldn't take me. I'm Class .I have a heart defect. Yeah? Is it serious? No.No, it's not serious. I'm justnot supposed to get excited.You know, no strain, no stress.

Yeah, it's all over, honey.I would really like tohave a baby one day. I really would. Why, of course.You can have as manychildren as you want. I'm sure you'll have very beautiful children. Oh, yes, I'm sure. I'm sure.You'll have Princes of Maine.You'll have Kings of New England.Lieutenant, I think you shouldfind yourself some fresh air. I still don't feel so good. Cut it out, children.Homer, what's a runt?Copperfield called me a runt.He was just kidding, Fuzz. Here. Orange is my favourite colour.Should I keep the teeth orange?Homer, look.Homer, look, look.Homer, when is Halloween? It's at the end of October. Is that soon?That's a few months away, Fuzz.Oh, it's the best time. Homer? What is Honolulu? Honolulu?Hmm. It's a city.Oh. What's the moonlight like?Well, I've never been there, but I think that it would probably be very bright. Oh.Why do we get pumpkinsonly once a year?Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.Eeew, that's disgusting!He does this all the time.Stop it right now. Hey. Hey. How's she doin'? Oh, she's fine. Good.Fine.I... I was wondering ifyou could give me a ride?Sure.I'd be glad to.Uh, a ride where?Where you goin'?We're headin' backto Cape Kenneth.Cape Kenneth? That sounds fine.Okay.Doubtless you will let me knowwhat immensely worthwhile...or at least useful thingthat it is you find to do.I wasn't intending to leavehere to be entirely useless.I expect I'll find someother way to be of use. In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways. Of course.Are you so stupid you imagine you'regoing to find a more gratifying life?What you will find is people likethe poor people who get left here.Only nobody takes care of them half as well.You won't be able to take care of them either.There's no taking care ofanybody, not out there.You know I'm grateful foreverything that you've done for me. I don't need your gratitude. I don't need this. I know all about my condition.It's your heart. You oughtto take it with you.Going where? Does he havea plan of some kind? Will he be back soon? I don't know. He's just leaving.You were the one who sayshe needs to see the world. That's what he'll do, is see the world. He's leaving. He'll need clothes. He'll need some money. Let him try to make some money.That's part of seeingthe world, isn't it?Oh, Wilbur, stop it. You knew this wasgoing to happen. He's a young man.He's still a boy.Out in the world,he's still a boy.Just find him someclothes, Wilbur.He could use some clothes.Homer.Copperfield. It'll be all right.Children, up on the porch.Up, up.Say goodbye. Wave from here. Bye. Bye. Bye, Homer.Bye, Homer.Come on. I can walk. Put me down. Nope. I wanna carry you. No, it's okay.

I want some fresh air.She'll be just fine.Is he gonna come out? Bye, Homer. Bye, Curly.Sorry I have to go.It's not fair. You're too old.I couldn't find Buster. Maybeyou could tell him that l...

Appleswere my dad's business,but with the war onshe's short of pickers. Wally thinks apples are boring. I never said they were boring.Yes, you did. You said applesweren't exactly flying. They aren't. I think I would like the apple business. You're a little overqualified, aren't you? No. No, not really. I need a job. Where are you headed? I don't know. What are you gonna do?I don't know.Is your family in the applebusiness too, Candy?No. But I work there. I like it.My dad's a lobster man. Oh, wow. Mmhmm.I've never actuallyseen a lobster.Are you serious?I've never seenthe ocean either.You... You've neverseen the ocean?That's not funny.That's serious.It's beautiful.Yeah.Do you have cramps?They'll ease up soon.As long as the bleedingisn't heavy, it's normal,it should taper off tomorrow.Catch!All right. Throw it back. Okay.All right!Put your fingers on the laces.Here's China. Here's India. Mmhmm. Sevenhour round trip flight. It's called the ""Burma run.""And this part's called ""Flying overthe hump."" These are the Himalayas.How high do you fly there?Well, I have to fly , feetwithin the first  minutes.Otherwise we won't make itover the first mountain. They got the worst air currents in the world. Dangerous, huh?Yeah. Actually, I volunteered.Did you really?Hey, look. If you're serious about wantinga job, picking apples isn't that boring.Yeah? Oh, I wouldlove that, Wally. See you around, Homer. Oh, yeah. Thank you, for everything. Mmhmm.Hi, Sam.Hi, Dad!Come on. You'regonna meet my mom.By the way, I've been ata wedding, all right?If it comes up, that's whereI met you, at the wedding.Wally?

Were you a friendof the groom's, Homer?Homer's a friend of the groom's,the bride's, everyone. Come on.In that case, maybe you'd liketo stay to dinner, Homer? Another time, Mom. You gotta meet Mr Rose.You used up all the hot water! You're usin' my soap, ain't you? I ain't usin' no soap.They're migrants.They pick the fruit. All kinds.They travel up and down thecoast with the seasons.The trick to Mr Rose is youhave to let him be boss.Oh, excuse me. The sink's backed up again, Wally. Not again.

It's a list of rules it seems. Whose rules?I imagine they'refor us, I suppose.Go on then. Read 'em, Homer.""One: Please don'tsmoke in bed.""It's too late for that one.Keep reading, Homer.""Two: Please don't operate the grinderor press if you've been drinking.""You know, they ain'tour rules, Homer.We didn't write 'em.

All right. You keep on workin', Homer. I'll be right back. Okay.Wilbur? Wilbur?Wilbur? You should read this.It's from the board.Another letter.""Merely suggesting that some newblood might benefit you all.Someone with new ideas in theobstetrical and paediatric fields.""I think they're just testingsome ideas for our next meeting.Dr Holtz seems nice. I thinkhe only wants to help.He's a goddam psychiatrist!Of course he wants to help.He'd be happy tohelp to commit me.It's this Mrs Goodhall youhave to be careful of, Wilbur.We have to be more thancareful of Mrs Goodhall.She has enough Christian zealto start her own country.I'd like to give hera little ether. So, what are you going to do? Take this.Homer Wells, born Portland,Maine, March , .But Homer was born here. In what was it? ? Mmhmm.Graduated Bowdoin College, .Harvard School ofMedicine, . That's you, Wilbur. You went there. An internship,and two years of training at theBoston LyingIn, South End Branch,he was judged an accomplishedgynaecological... and obstetrical surgeon... That's not him.With experience inpaediatric care.Wilbur, you're making this up.Angela, the board isgoing to replace me.That is what thenew blood is for.You mean they're going to replace you withsomeone who doesn't perform abortions.Well, we can only guess at that.They are against the law.These credentials areagainst the law.We all know I trained Homer, so hiscredentials are as good as mine.And don't be holy tome about the law.What has the law everdone for anyone here?So, what do you thinkabout my candidate?What about school records? Homerdoesn't have any diplomas.Come here, Edna, please.Come here.He will have them.Wilbur!I don't know...All of these on there, okay. Gotta pack 'em tight now, y'all. I got it.What do you think we do? All aboard, Mrs Worthington. Thank you, Arthur.How's this crew this year?Got any rotten apples? It's a good crew, ma'am. Hey, Rose Rose. You tryin' to break my finger? Damn! Just an accident.Excuse me.Well, maybe we got one bad apple,but it's nothing we can't handle.I see.How's young Homer working out? Good. He's a smart young man. Hey, Homer. Wally was right about him. Real hard worker. Good.Mornin', Miss Worthington.Why don't you come up and visit me at the house?I know I've got clothes that will fit you. Okay. I'm sure I can find a ton of things to fit you.Rose don't really need anymore pickin' clothes, ma'am. Uhhuh. Now don't be a partypooper, Arthur.I have a beautiful blouse... Hey, Rose Rose. Homer. Hey. Hi.How you feelin'?When I'm not thinkingof Wally, I'm fine.I'm not really goodat being alone.Oh.Feeling much better. Thanks.Hey, listen.Maybe if you're free, you'd like tocome and have dinner at my dad's place? Okay. You haven't seen a lobster yet, have you? No. Oh, good.You're hungry, right? What is that?  It's a drivein movie theatre. It's a movie outside? Yeah. Oh, can we see it? Okay. It's closed now because of the blackouts. Oh.It's so big.You smoke? You want a cigarette?Okay.Wally would kill me ifhe saw me doin' this. There you go. Thanks.So, you like movies?Yes. Seen only one, though.You've seen only one? Which one?Uh, King Kong. It's really good.Mmm. Oh.Wilbur, it's a pie apple. Here, look.See? Try one of those.So he's an appleexpert now, is he?Oh, my, yes. That's afar superior taste.And crisp too.So many apples aredisappointingly mealy.Wilbur, he pickedthese for us himself.You don't find it depressing thatHomer Wells is picking apples?Or that he can't be botheredto write us a proper letter?Wilbur, it's a gift.I'll show him a gift.I'll send him a gift he can use.There goes Jimmy Stewarton his way to enlist.One of the most popularstars on the screen.Today he's LieutenantStewart, U.S.A.Crossing the equator, there's a lighterside, as novices are introduced...to the traditionalrealm of King Neptune.Boxing matches, helping relieve themonotony of long, weary days at sea.Well, it lookedlike you liked it.I did like it. All I saidwas, it's no King Kong.I mean, first she loved him, then shedidn't. Then no one else could have him.No, but she did love him. Howmany women have you known?And what did she die of exactly?She was torn apart. Shedied of a broken heart.Oh. Well, I just...I need a bettermedical explanation.Torn apart. At least KingKong, he knew what he wanted.Hey, what you doin'with that Candy, Homer?Makin' history, I suppose. You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope. No trouble.That Candy, she's thenicest girl I know.She's about the most beautiful girl I've everseen, but I don't know if she's the nicest.She's the nicest and mostbeautiful girl I've ever known.See, that sounds like youin trouble already, Homer.Sounds like bigtrouble to me, Homer. I'm not in trouble. Yeah, you is.I know when peopleare in trouble.You is.His name is Homer Wells,and his pathetic resumeis the best I've seen.I find it hard to believe that the boardwould be interested in this character.But he looks like anexcellent young man.A firstrate candidate.Don't you think?He looks like a bleeding heartmissionary moron to me.But that would be the problem with anydoctor interested in coming here. Do you know him? No, and I don't want to.He's doing missionarywork in India.I wrote to him weeks ago, but eitherhe's too holy or too busy to answer.Tomboy!Sorry. Okay. Come on.I fail to see how someonecourageous enough...to make a commitment to a foreign missionis automatically to be dismissed.That part of the world requires preciselythe kind of dedication that is needed here.Does it snow in Bombay?One winter here and we'll beshipping him south in a coffin!But Dr Larch, he seemsexceptionally qualified.I'm not talking about hismedical qualifications.It's the Christian thing that bothers me. I justdon't see it as being much use around here.I fail to see how a littleChristianity could hurt anyone here.Anyway, I was just showing youthis guy as an example...of what's available. I didn't think you'd be interested. We're very interested. Oh, yes, very. You wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him?Well, it wouldn'thurt to meet him. What's his name again? Dr Homer Wells. It's a nice name. Very New England. Very Maine.A very local sounding name.Very.I told you. If Iappear to want it,they don't want it.If I appear to hate it,they just gotta have it. Excuse me. I just wanna ask you something. Edna, come dance with me.Let's be foolish tonight.Come on.Does he know he's supposed to be in India?Does he even want to come back?He's a field hand!What could possiblyhold him there?Homer! It's time to go! Oh, I gotta go. Okay.Right now, we're usin' themearly Macs and Gravensteins.Cider is way too watery, man. Weain't gonna get no good cider...till we start pickin' them GoldenDelicious and Winter Bananas...and Russets andBaldwins, you know.What about worms? Don'tthe drops have worms?Well, yeah, they got worms, Homer.That ain't nothin' but protein, man.Jack?What the hell is you doin', man?Don't you know that cigarette's gonna ruinthis whole batch of cider? I can't have that.You gonna have to get that out of there.You're gonna have to go fishin', boy. You mean swimmin'? Swimmin' or fishin'.I ain't goin' in that vatto fish out no cigarette.Now, Jack...Come on down here, manWhat business are you in, Jack?Just tell me whatbusiness you're in.Just say you're in the apple business 'causethat's the only business you wanna be in.Hey, Jack!

Will they believe that, you think? They'll believe it...because they want to believe it. Shouldn't we tell Homer? If Homer wanted to know what was happening here,he could pick up thetelephone and call us.I think it was a nurse or a nannywho, uh, who adopted Fuzzy.Someone who couldtake care of him.Because they had a betterbreathing machine...than the one that DrLarch built for him.So I think we should behappy for Fuzzy, okay?He found a family.Good night, Fuzzy.Good night, Fuzzy.Homer.

Homer? Do you think it's not obvious to us what's happened to you?You've fallen inlove, haven't you?By the way, whatever you're up tocan't be too good for your heart.Then again, it's the sort of condition thatcould be made worse by worrying about it,so don't worry about it.Dear Dr Larch:What I'm learning here may not be asimportant as what I learned from you,but everything is new to me.Yesterday, I learnedhow to poison mice.Field mice girdle an apple tree,pine mice kill the roots.You use poison oatsand poison corn.I know what you have to do.You have to play God.Well, killing mice is as close asI want to come to playing God.Homer, here in St. Cloud's,I have been given theopportunity of playing God...or leaving practicallyeverything up to chance.Men and women of conscienceshould seize those moments...when it's possible to play God.There won't be many.Do I interfere whenabsolutely helpless women...tell me they simply can'thave an abortion...that they simply must go through withhaving another and yet another orphan?I do not. I do noteven recommend.I just give them what they want.You are my work of art, Homer.Everything else hasbeen just a job.I don't know if you've gota work of art in you,but I know what your jobis: You're a doctor.I'm not a doctor.You're going to replace me.The board of trustees islooking for my replacement.I can't replace you. I'm sorry.""Sorry""? I'm not sorry.Not for anything I've done.I'm not even sorrythat I love you.I think we may havelost him to the world.Come on, come on.Just read the label. Come on. Come on.

Come in. The captain was still flying the plane.None of the men on the ground could seethe sky. That's how thick the jungle was.They never saw the plane crash.They never heard it crash.They never saw CaptainWorthington's parachute either.But he was missing for  days.Why?He followed the IrrawaddyRiver all the way to Rangoon.He managed to avoid the Japsbut not the mosquitoes.So it's malaria.It's, um, encephalitis ""B.""What's that?Captain Worthington isparalysed from the waist down.He... He won't walk. I'm sorry. When is he coming home?In about a month. Bythe end of October.Just tell me.

Oh, don't do that, Homer.I just want to sithere and do nothing.To do nothing.It's a great idea, really.Maybe if I just waitand see long enough,then I won't have to do anythingor decide anything, you know?I mean, maybe ifI'm lucky enough,someone else will decide andchoose and do things for me.What are you talking about?But then again, maybe Iwon't be that lucky.And it's not my fault.It's not your fault.And that's just it. Someone's gonnaget hurt, and it's no one's fault. I don't want to talk about this. If we just sit here...and we wait and see alittle while longer,then maybe you won't have to choose,and I won't have todo anything!What do you want from me? Wally'sbeen shot down. He's paralysed.What do you want me to do?Nothing. I'm sorry.You're not the one whohas to do anything.Where you think you're goin'?I got to go, Daddy. Youhave to let me go.Wait, Rose. Just wait.

They outrageous, them rules.Who live in this cider house?Who grindin' up those apples,pressin' that cider,cleanin' up all this mess?Who just plain live here, justbreathin' in that vinegar?Well, someone who don'tlive here made those rules.These rules ain't for us.We the ones supposedto make our own rules.And we do.Every single day.Ain't that right, Homer?That's right.Then why don't you burnthem rules in the stove?Go 'head, Homer.

Do you have something else for me? Do you know what this is? Oh, that's my heart. No, actually, it's Fuzzy's.There's nothing wrongwith your heart.Dr Larch wanted to keep you out of the war.That's why he told you it was yours.I think he was worriedabout his own heart.He said it would never stand upto Homer Wells going off to war.""Thus I began my new life...""in a new name and witheverything new about me.""I felt like one in a dream.""The remembrance of my old life isfraught with so much want of hope.""Whether it lasted for a yearor more or less I do not know.""I only know that it was...""and ceased to be.And there I leave it.""Is that all?No, there's muchmore to come, Curly.Well, that's tomorrow.Let's not give the story away.Good night, youPrinces of Maine,you Kings of New England."
An Education,2010,"An EducationCome on, girls.Anybody?Anybody else?Jenny. Again.Isn’t it because Mr Rochester’sblind?Yes, Jenny.I've got an English essay to do bytomorrow morning.Right.So, the only sound I want to hearcoming through this ceilingis the sound of sweat dripping ontotextbooks. Cello? No cello.I thought we agreed that cello wasmy interest or hobby?Well, it already is your interest orhobby.So, when they ask you at yourOxford interview,“What's your interest or hobby?”you can say, ""the Cello""and you won't be a lying. Look, youdon't have to practise a hobby.A hobby is a hobby.Can I stop going to the youthorchestra, then?No.No, no. The youth orchestra isa good thing.That shows you're a joinerinner.Ah. Yes. But. I've already joined in.So now I can stop.No.No. Well, that just shows theopposite, don't you see?No, that shows you're a rebel.They don't want that at Oxford.No. They don't want people who thinkfor themselves.No, of course they don't.Jenny.Shall I wear, like, Sunday best?You'd better, I'm afraid.Just to show my father you'reun jeune homme serieux,not a teddy boy.Oh, God. Right.I need to go. It'll bucket down ina minute.All right...I'll see you at the weekend. Bye, then. Bye. Sorry. Sorry. Bye.Good bye, my love.Come on. Come on.Stop it, now! Stop it!Oh, no. Look, what you've done.The nice man's waiting for us. It fell off.?My socks are wet.Hello.Look.If you've got any sense, you wouldn'ttake a lift from a strange man.But I'm a music lover, and I'mworried about your cello. So...What I propose is, you put it inmy car and walk alongside me.How do I know you won't justdrive off with the cello?Good point.How much does a new cello cost?Ten? Fifteen pounds? I don't know.Let's say fifteen.No? All right.Up to you.Thank you.And that. I'm David, by the way. Jenny.  Very good.How did the concert go?It was a rehearsal. The concert'snext Thursday. What are you playing? Elgar.I think it's a shame he spent so muchtime in Worcester, don't you?Worcester's too near Birmingham.And you can hear that in the music.There's a terrible Brummy accent inthere, if you listen hard enough.Anyway, Elgar and the Jews don't mixvery well.I'm not a Jew!No. I am.I wasn't accusing you.Can I sit in the car with my cello?Jump in.Oh, thank you.I've never seen a car like thisbefore. C'est tres chic.It's a Bristol. Not many of 'emmade.Where to, madam?Jenny live round the corner.Worst luck!I'll see, what I can do.I suppose cellists must go to alot of concerts.We don't go to any concerts. Wedon't believe in them.Oh, they're real.So people say.Smoke?I'd best not. I live just up there. Why don't we believe in them? He'd say there's no point to them. Your father, this is? Oh, yes.They're just for fun.Apart from school concerts,which are no fun at all,so we go to those.They don't help you get on.Which of course is what is sowonderful about them.Anyway, you'll go one day.I know. I will.If I get to University,I'm going to read what I want, andlisten to what I want,and I'm going to look at paintingsand watch French films,and I'm gonna talk to people whoknow lots about lots. Good for you. Yes.Which University?Oxford. If I'm lucky.Did you go anywhere?I studied at what I believe theycall the University of Life.I didn't get a very good degreethere.Well, thank you for driving me home.# Sous le ciel de Paris #You alright?

He's wishing me luck for tonight.Is that all he's wishing you? Wherehe get the money from?He earns it, I expect.Earns it? Why isn't he at school?Um... Can we just go?Otherwise the goodluck flowers willactually be responsible for meactually missing the concert. Whichwould be ironic, n'est ce pas?I don't like it.Objection noted. Jenny?Noted.It's going to be ten bob's worth ofluck here.I mean, that's a bit much fora schoolgirl, isn't it?We can't leave it here.I mean, I'd burgle a house withflowers left outside.They’ll think we’re made of money.Thank you, Marjorie.Camus doesn't want you to like him.Feeling is bourgeois.Being engagee is bourgeois.He kills someone and he doesn't feelanything.His mother dies and he doesn't feelanything.I wouldn't feel anything if mymother died.Does that make me an existentialist?No. That makes you a cow.Une vache.Well, after I've been to University,I'm going to be French,and I'm going to Paris, and I'mgoing to smoke and wear black,and listen to Jacques Brel,and I won't speak.

Thank you.And I'd like you to go with you.Seven?All right.And... Um...We'll probably go for a spot ofsupper afterwards.Supper.If you want to.But the thing is, we'll probablyhave eaten.Well. If you'd like supper, then,perhaps on Friday you could...not eat.Yes. Of course. A spot of supper? You've heard of supper?We've heard of it. But we've nevereaten it.So, you're going to have to tell useverything.Otherwise it's not fair.I won't allow it!  Fine. He's morethen happy for you to take me.Fine. I will. Good. Well. Where is it? St John’s Smith Square. Where's that?I don't know. I'm sure we could findout.It's in Westminster. Right next doorto the Abbey.How d'you know that?I had a life before we were married,you know. He soon put a stop to that. There we are. Where are we?We're near Westminster Abbey. I'mnot going all the way over there.The trouble is, that's whereSt John's Smith Square is.Oh, come on. There must be somethingon locally. Where's the paper?She wants to see someone who canplay.She doesn't want to see SheilaKirkland scratching away.I'll take her.And how do you propose to get there?RAF Helicopter? That's him.  Oh, bloody hell. Jack!Oh, by the way... David's a Jew.A wandering Jew. So watch yourself.What she mean by that? I've neversaid anything like that!It's just an expression! Look, I'vegot nothing against the Jews!Glad to hear it. Hello.No. I didn't mean I've got nothingagainst you...No. Of course. I do mean that.  Dad? It's not... Sorry. It's just...You're not the sort of person thatI'd be against. But I wouldn't,because I'm not that kind of personwho would be against... people.I'm Jack, this is my wife, Marjorie.You didn’t tell me you had a sister,Jenny.Please.You're a lucky man, Jack.Yes, I suppose I am.This is lovely.Thank you.I'm sorry, David. Would you like adrink?I'd love one, Jack, but we'rerunning a little late.If Jenny's ready, perhaps we'llshoot off.Actually, David, Dad has somethinghe has to tell you.No, really. It was just a question.A point of reference.What's the best way to get toSt John’s Smith Square from here?It's a straight run, really. Up toHammersmith,take the A through Kensington andyou’re there. Simple as that. Simple as that.So, I book us some tickets.No But have her back by ten,David.I was hoping she might come with meafterwards for a stop of supperwith my aunt Helen.Oh, well, I...No, no, um...She's usually in bed by then.What if I promise that to have herback by eleven thirty?Well, it’s Friday night. And you'regoing all the way to the West End...Thanks, Jack. I appreciate it.All right. Bye. Byebye.Have a nice time.Come.Hello hello.Are we late?No. I thought we were gonna miss thebeginning, and then it wouldn’t beworth going in, and we could go offdancing or something.Helen is one of the more reluctantmembers of tonight’s audience. Hello.  Hello.  Jenny, these aremy friends Helen and Danny.Shall we?All right.Sorry.That's alright. It's lovely, isn'tit?It's beautiful. Where did you get itfrom?Oh, I even don't know, Chelseasomewhere...Oh, yours is... Well, good for thissort of concert, isn’t it?Thank you.We should go shopping together oneday, you know, if you want.That would be nice. But Chelsea...C'est beaucoup trop cher pour moi.Sorry?I just said, it's too expensive forme.No you didn't. You said somethingcompletely different.No. Well, I said it in French.In French? Why?I don't know.Well. Chelsea is too expensive forme, too, really.But we don't have to worry aboutthat.If you want something in Chelsea,just get David to take you shopping.Why would David want to take meshopping?I booked a table at Juliette's. Willthat kill the mood, do you think?Oh, I hope so.God, I always think I'm going to myown funeralwhen I listen to classical music.That was classical, wasn't it?Yes. Very classical. As classical asyou can get.Juliette's it is, then. Heaven forbidthat we should end the eveningreflecting on our own mortality.# I want a Sunday kind of love ## A love to last past Saturdaynight #?Extraordinary woman, Greco. Justlike here Helen.What about ""Chante Francoise Sagan?""Have you heard about that one?Wonderful.I've only got... Well, I think it'sjust called ""Juliette Greco.""The one with the eyes on the sleeve.I saved up and got my Frenchconversation teacherto bring it back after Christmas. You've got a French conversationteacher?  Yes.Is that why you suddenly speakFrench for no reason?Never heard her sing? She'smarvellous.You should see her in Paris, nothere. David will take you.I'd love to. You'd fit right in.Better than here, really.Isn't it wonderful to find a youngperson wants to know things.There's so much I want you to see.Are you all right to come and havea look at that Pembroke Villas placewith me on Friday, Danny?Oh, no. I can't.There’s a BurneJones coming up atChristie’s on Friday.Desperate to get my hands on it.You're thinking of buying aBurneJones? A real one?I just have a feeling that the preRaphaelites are going to take off.I love the preRaphaelites. Do you? Yes, of course.Rossetti and BurneJones, anyway.Not Holman Hunt, so much.He's so garish. Oh, absolutely!Well, why don't we all go to theauction together?Auction? Gosh! How exciting!Next Friday morning.Friday. Oh.You're busy?Oh, yes.Tant pis.Pas de probleme.Are you sure you're busy?No. I'm sure I could rearrange.That would be lovely.# You got me wrapped around yourlittle finger ## If this is Love, it's everythingI hoped it would be ## When we kiss, It's as if our lipsagree ## that we were meant to be ## When we touch... #What are you doing?I can't get this casserole dishclean. It’s all burnt round...It's twentyfive to twelve.We finish tea at seven.I know what the time is.How was your evening?Best night of my life.Night, mum.There were like two violins, onecello, two violas, a harp.I don't want to hear about Ravel.I want to know what else was on theprogramme.There was nothing like that. He wasthe perfect gentleman.He just said he wanted to take meplaces and show me things. Things. Plural? Oh my Gawd!I knew that ""Jane Eyre"" wouldeventually work its magic upon you.I'm presuming that's what you're soanimated about.Of course. ""Jane Eyre"" and Jenny'snew boyfriend.He's not my “new boyfriend”.It's true. He's more a manfriend,actually?He's got a sportscar, Miss Stubbs. It's Maroon.So, could we call him Mr. Rochesterfigure.I think he must be as blind asMr. Rochester.You may have noticed, I'm tryingto stir the subject awayfrom Jenny's lurid lovelife and intothe matter in hand.This is clear from this evidencethat most of you know further muchabout the former, and next to nothingabout the latter.Reluctantly I have to admitt thatJenny is clearly an expert on both.Excellent as always, Jenny.

Oh, I wouldhave been so interested.As you can see, I just love things.That's not a LockeyHill!There aren't many people who comein here and say that. No. Certainly not me. Oh, it's beautiful. Do you play? Thank you.I used to. I vowed to myself thatone day I'd own one of these.And now I do and I won't even touchthe bugger.It's vulgar, putting it on display.Give it to Jenny.I think, that would be even morevulgar.Play for us, Jenny.No, no. One day. When I'm goodenough.She's good enough now.David, you've never seen me play.I can come and hear you in Oxford,when you get there.We should all go and spend aweekend in Oxford.Straw boaters, punting, cream teas,antiquarian bookshops. Boats?Bit of business, if we can find it.What about next weekend?Yes.I wouldn't be allowed to do that.I'll talk to them.You're going to ask my father if youcan take me away for the weekend?He'd have you arrested. We'll see. I bet you can't. How much?I'd be careful if I were you,Jenny.You don't know who you're dealingwith.Halfacrown.You're on.How do you know Danny?Oh, you know. We kept bumping intoeach other, and we became pals,ended up doing a bit of businesstogether, when it suits us.What kind of business?Property. A bit of art dealing.Some buying and selling. This andthat...Alright, just be two ticks. Okay.???Mr. Goldman, good to see you.?Madam.All right.Hey.All right. I got this one.And... Um...Go on, then.Sorry about that.How do you know those negro people?They're clients.Clients?Schwarzers have to live somewhere.It's not as if they can rent offtheir own kind, is it?Test results for the Virgiltranslation.We'll start from the bottom.Patricia. Absent.Margaret. %.Jenny. %.That would just about scrape a passin the exam proper.Not good enough for Oxfordcandidates.It’s her Latin, isn’t it?Everyone’s doing their best, Jack.But what if everyone's best isn’tgood enough? What do we do then?Well. Perhaps the whole thing’s beena waste of money anyway.You don’t mean that.What’s she going to do with anEnglish degree?And if she’s going to spend threeyears playing that bloody cello,talking in French to a bunch ofbeatniks,Well, I’m just throwing good moneyafter bad.Well, she might meet a nice lawyer.She could do that at a dinner dancetomorrow.That’s the point of an Oxfordeducation, isn't it dad?It’s the expensive alternative toa dinner dance.What about private tuition?Can anybody hear me? How much isthis going to cost me?Five shillings an hour. Maybe alittle more for Alevel.Five bob! Oh, we spend five bobhere, we spend five bob there,next thing you know that’s oursavings down the drain.And what else are we spending fivebob on?What else are we spending six penceon?Oh, nothing. No, nothing. All ofthis is free.This vase is free.It was, actually. It was a presentfrom Auntie Vi.That chair. This sofa. It's allfree.We don’t have to pay for any of it.You see, that's the beauty of life,Jenny.You don't have to pay for anything.You know, there's a lovely Oxfordtree growing in the garden,lucky for you, because that’s Oxfordtaken care of.And there's a whole orchard ofschool trees,so that’s school is free.And I think there's even a privatetuition tree in there.I'll just go and check, shall I? Jack?That's all right, Marjorie. Don'tworry. It'll only be a second.Because I think there's a whole clumpof themsurrounding the pocket money tree.I'll just go make sure, they're allnice and safe, shall I?Oh, by the way, you might be lucky,there might be a manwith deep pockets growing out there.Because God know, you gonna need one.You could always take secretarialcollege with Hattie. Oh, thanks. Charming.Oh, God, no.Hello.Hello. Graham.Haven’t seen you in ages!It all went wrong, didn’t it?The teaparty, I mean.Was it because of the year offthing? Because I...No.I just have so much work to do ifI’m going to get the grades I need.Yeah. She’s got no time for boys. Bye, Graham. Bye.Yes.???? Oh, you do all the Goons. No, my Eccles is no good. Oh, no, you've got him. No. No.?Hello.Oh, Jenny.David does the most fantasticBluebottle.You came to see my parents?Oh, why is that so hard to imagine?Why are you drinking?It's not Christmas!Oh, there's a lot of you don’t knowabout us, young lady.We had a life before you came along.That’s true.I’m only going on what I’ve seen forthe last sixteen years.I’m trying to think what you missed.Nothing much comes to mind.Right.Anyway. I’ve got a huge pile ofLatin translation to do.You didn’t tell us David went toOxford.No. I didn’t.For all the good it did me. Isn’t that funny? Extraordinary.I was just telling Jack that I’mgoing back next weekend.I go and visit my old Englishprofessor every now and again.See, that’s what you need, Jenny.Someone on the inside track.It’s not always what you know, isit, David?Too true. Did you come across CliveLewis?Dad's never come across anyone.He wrote a children’s book called""The Lion, The Witch and TheWardrobe""that did very well, I believe.CS Lewis?Well, to us he was just the oldcodgerwho taught Medieval literature butI came to know him very well.We just... got along.Jenny used to devour those books.I’d love to meet him.I’m sorry. I’m being slow on theuptake.Would Jenny like to come at theweekend?No. Not this weekend. But sometimes,perhaps... Yes.How often do you see him?Not very often. Every couple ofyears.Maybe next time.Well, I suppose...Would she have to stay the night?I wouldn’t recommend driving homeafter one of those Oxford dinners.Clive could get her a room in thecollege. That’s easy enough.Seems like too good an opportunityto pass up.It wouldn't be a bother, would it,David?# We walk along hand in hand #Come on!Just putting a few things into thebag. Don't worry.# Yeah, we both understand ## Mm, sweet nothings #Come on!We're nearly ready. Be there in twoticks.How can they only be nearlyready?I wouldn’t be surprised if three ofthem come out then.The only explanation. They’re makingthemselves a friend.Ladies! Come on! Let’s go.There. Have a look in the corner.Open the door.You should keep that one, if youwant it.I can only wear so many one day.Thank you.What about tonight? We got to put ona nightie.I thought I'd share a room with you?You haven't slept with him?No.Good for you.Really? Do you think so?Yes. Well, you’re only sixteen. Youdon’t want to get pregnant, do you?No. I wouldn't let that happen.I want to wait until I’m seventeen.On my seventeenth birthday,hopefully.With David?Golly. It will be with David, won’tit?If that’s what you want.Anyway. I’ll find you a nightie.Tadaa!Shall we make a move?# You got me wrapped around yourlittle finger ## If this is love, it's everythingI hoped it would be #Can we get off and have a lookaround?Later. If we have timeImagine spending three years here.I know.Take a bow. It's all about...Why university girls arestrangelooking?They can’t all have started off thatway, can they?I mean, most girls aren’t born ugly,but most girl students seem to be.So there must be something aboutthese placesthat make you fat, or spotty, orshortsighted.Well, when you look at it likethat...I mean, that’s proper scientificanalysis.You can’t argue with science.I still not quite understand whatyou want to do when you get here.I want to read English.Books?Sorry?You want to read English books?Reading English is just another wayof saying...Don't worry, Jenny. You’re wastingyour breath.Anyway, tomorrow we’ll get more ofa feel for the place.Absolutely. This place would be goodfor a little business.All of those little old ladieswandering around... Old Ladies? This place is rife with stats.Please explain what stats are.You’re always going on about them. It isn't very interesting. But you two are interested.It's because we're not veryinteresting either. Oh, no. They're not, really. True.So we have an idiot here, to save usfrom ourselves.Yeah. To put some intelligence andculture into our brutal lives.Sing to us! Sing to usPlease, don't make me sing to you.Please don't make us talk aboutwork.So. Now. Is he Clive, do you think?Or CS?I’m confused now. I thought you’dmade him up?No, we...Never mind.“To dear Jenny. With the pleasureof meeting you.""""Come and see me again soon. Clive.”Dirty old man.Bad girl.We've got these exact same curtainsat home.Let’s not talk about curtains.You look beautiful.David...There’s something you should know.I’m a virgin. And I want to staythat way until I’m seventeen.I think that’s good. I think that’sright.We can still be romantic, can’t we?Yes, of course. As long as it's notactually.Minnie...Is that me?Yes. You’re my Minnie Mouse, andI’m your bubbalub.Okay. If that's what you want to do. Minnie. Yes, David?Bubbalub...Bubbalub?May I have a look? Just a peek?You just want to see them?Thank you.I think there's a house for salearound here.Really?Might be worth a look.?Jenny... Aren’t you coming? We don’t go in.What are you talking about?Why don't you go and get a nice cupof tea somewhere.Helen will look after you.I don’t need looking after, thankyou very much. David?I’m not going to tell you a secondtime. Run along.They won’t be long. Either way.""Either way?""Well sometimes they find something,and sometimes they don’t.And when they do find something, weoften have to leave quite quickly.They can be a quite naughty,sometimes. Thank you.  Good bye.  Cheerio. Catch!Carefulcarefulcareful!Come on.Helen. Pass the ball.Good.Jenny!What?  You can stand there, if youlike. But I won't recommend it.Cooee. Jenny.Sorry about being a little briskback there, Jenny.It's just the way we do things.Silly, really.Hey, don't forget your case. Who's coming up for a drink? Me? No.You go. I’ll make my own way home.Jenny?Jenny!It's an old map. A Speed.Poor dear didn’t even know what itwas.It's a waste. It shouldn’t spendits life on a wall in...wherever the hell we were.It should be with us. We know how tolook after it properly.We liberated it. Liberated?That’s one word for it.Don’t be bourgeois, Jenny. You’rebetter than that.You drink everything I put in frontof you down in one,and you slam your glass down on thebar and ask for more,it’s wonderful.We’re not clever like you, so wehave to be clever in other ways,because if we weren’t, there wouldbe no fun.We have to be clever with maps,and...You want to know what stats are?Stats are old ladies who are scaredof coloured people.So we move the coloureds in and theold ladies move outand I buy their flats cheap.That’s what I do. So now you know.And if you don’t like it,I'll understand, and you can go backto Twickenhamand listen to the Home Service anddo your Latin homework.But these weekends, and therestaurants and the concertsThey don’t grow on trees.This is who we are, Jenny.Oh.  Oh.  That's nice. Come on, you two! Come on up!You can have my olive.Come on.I suppose you have homework to do.You have no idea how boringeverything was before I met you.""Action is character"", our Englishteacher says.I think it means that if we neverdid anything,we wouldn’t be anybody.And I never did anything beforeI met you.And sometimes I think no one’s everdone anythingin this whole stupid country, apartfrom you.Okay. All right.There you go.Good night.Marjorie, look at this.""Clive..."" Lucky girl.Never a dull moment with David, eh?Better than the young man youbrought home for tea.David’s a lot older than Graham.Graham could live to be two hundredyears old,you'll never see him swanningaround with famous authors.Hasn’t got it in him.Graham might become a famous author,for all you know.Becoming one isn’t the same asknowing one.That shows you're well connected.Very impressive young man, yourDavid.I must admitt, life is a littlebrighter with him around.Come on girls. Get your moves on.??What the hell are those?Russian Sobranies.Where did they come from?She probably bought them from theSavoy, or Claridges, or the opera,or some fancy nightclub.Who knows, with Jenny?Paris. You can’t buy them here. You never bought them yourself? No. I never.Oh, shut up, you stuckup cow.But I’ll bring you some back, ifyou like. You’re joking? Non. He’s taking you to Paris? Oui.

Allthose suppers you’ve had off him.Ouch.You've such a Victorian attitude tosex, you two.Your parents wouldn't let youswan off like that, would they?They don’t know yet.David will come up with some story.He usually does.Yeah. I’ve noticed that.Chanel perfume, Chanel perfume.Chanel lipstick, Chanel lipstick.Those funny cigarettes you weresmoking. Sobranies.Ten packets each.How much is that Chanel perfume?Oh, are you the girl going to Paris,or are you not? Because...Tina, top button.Jenny, the headmistress wants a wordwith you.The legend of Mr. Rochester may havetravelled further than you intended.Come.Ah. Miss Mellor.We’re all very excited about yourforthcoming trip to Paris.Our excitement, indeed, knows nobounds.Some of us can talk of little else.An older man, I understand.A word of warning, Miss Mellor.There may well have been the oddsixthform girl who has lostan important part of herselfperhaps the best partwhile under our supervision. Thesethings happen, regrettably.If, however, we are made aware ofthat loss,then of course the young lady inquestionwould have to continue her studieselsewhere,if she still has any use for""A"" levels.Did I make myself clear? Can I go now? If you want.What are you doing in there?But I imagine she's lighting thecandles on my cake.You're seventeen, not two hundredand fifty. Thanks for inviting me.  That wasMarjorie's idea, not mine.Not even Jenny's for that matter. Dad?Cake!Well. Blow them out before the houseburns down!Okay Don't worry.Bravo. Who'd like a piece? Me, please.Come on! Come on! Presents!Oops!It's a new Latin dictionary.Thank you. I needed a new one.Oh dear.Snap!Oh, good grief!Jenny, you should see this.it's a special day. She’s a special girl.

I don’t think it would agreewith me.Dad!The French don't like us, Jenny. Youknow that.John Sutton form work, he went therelast year.They were very rude to him.I don’t want to spoil anyone’s fun,but it’s just not for me, Europe.You'll have to go another time.You’ve just said you don’t likeEurope.So, what’s going to change?It’ll have to be Europe, won’t it?Because it certainly won't be you.I'll take her. To the continent? Why not? And leave me here on my own? Oh, for God’s sake.What do you think?You know, what Jenny likes aboutFrance, Jack?French films, and books, and music.Of course I do.Sorry. Yes, 'cause without sayingshe's your daughter.Jenny likes the joke about how you'rethe stick in the mudand all the rest of it, but I knowthat's not who you are.Otherwise, she wouldn't be, who sheis.No.But I can also see that I've actedout of turn and...I'm sorry.What about your Aunt Helen?An hour late.We'll make it. I promise.Okay. There's a flight at eight inthe morning.Good.There’s no bed.Ah. I pushed the boat out and gotus a suite.A suite!Well, if work stops us getting toParis until tomorrow,then we can buy us a nice hotel room.Anyway, it’s a special occasion,isn’t it?I would thought tonight of allnights we only need a bed.Hold on a second.

The potting shed.Who does he think I am? PrinceRainier of Monaco?What if I got married instead ofgoing to college?Married?Married.Well. It would depend who it was, ofcourse.Would it?

Or is it toolate.Of course she’s got a choice.An interesting one, too, eh?This is where you’re supposed tosay, “But what about Oxford?”Well. Looked at it another way,you wouldn’t really need to go now,would you?I wouldn’t need to go. Would youlike to expand on that?You'd been looking after.All that Latin! All those essays!What was the point?Why didn’t you just send me prowlinground nightclubs?It would have been less trouble. AndI might have had more fun.I don’t know about nightclubs.I know about education.Anyway, it looks like it mighthave turned out for the best.How?He wouldn’t want you if you werethick, would he?May not an ass know when the cartdraws the horse?Sings whoop jug I love thee.And when it says ""Sings"", it meansyou sing a line.Never mind. Right. Lear...Does any here know me.This is not Lear.Does Lear walk thus? Speak thus?Where are his eyes?Ha! Waking? Who is it that can tellme who I am?Ooh. Miss. Me. I can.Oh, Jenny.What?Take it off.Oh my God. Is that what I think itis?I'm going to be a bridesmaid!You know the school rule on jewelry.Half the girls in this room arewearing jewelry.Yes. But none of it is going to ruintheir lives.We have a difference of opinionabout that.How far advanced are theseridiculous plans?Have you set a date? Have youdecided on a church?We won’t be getting married in achurch. David’s Jewish.Jewish? He’s a Jew?You’re aware, I take it, that theJews killed our Lord?And you’re aware, I suppose, thatour Lord was Jewish?I suppose he told you that.We’re all very sorry about whathappened at during the War.But that’s absolutely no excuse forthat sort of maliciousand untruthful propaganda.Anyway, I can see you are far more inneed of responsible advicethan I realised.Nobody does anything worth doingwithout a degree.Nobody does anything worth doingwith the degree. No woman, anyway.So what I do isn’t worth doing.Or what Miss Stubbs does, or MrsWilson, or any of us here.Because none of us would be herewithout the degree,you do realise that, don’t you?And yes, of course studying is hard,and boring...Boring!I’m sorry?Studying is hard and boring.Teaching is hard and boringSo what you’re telling me is to bebored, and then bored,and finally bored again, but thistime for the rest of my life.This whole stupid country is bored.There’s no life in it, or colour,or fun.It’s probably just as well that theRussians are going to dropa nuclear bomb on us any day now.So my choice is to do something hardand boring, or to marry my Jew,and go to Paris and Rome and listento jazzand read and eat good food in nicerestaurants and have fun.It’s not enough to educate us anymore, Mrs Walters.You’ve got to tell us why you’redoing it.It doesn’t have to be teaching,you know.There’s the Civil Service.I don’t wish to be impertinent,Mrs Walters.But it is an argument worthrehearsing.You never know. Someone else mightwant to know the point of it all,one day.Where did you find him? I can't tell you that. Why?I think he likes you Do you likeher?""I thought you would like her.""You do... you don't...You don't remember? It's Jenny! Youremember her from the last time?""No. I don't""Yes, you do.You're naughty! You're pardoned?You're naughty.Go stick to your own species.He wants to kiss you, I think.Isn't that naughty? Yes.We're engaged.Seriously? No. Really? Yeah.  Engaged?  Show her.Yes. Look!Gosh. That’s fantastic news.Ooh, thank you.Congratulations.I knew you’d see sense aboutuniversity. You’ll stay pretty now.Thank you. Can I still read?Of course. But it doesn't have to bebooks, does it?And magazines will do just as well.And you learn more from them anyway.Oh, Helen.You won’t be laughing, David, whenshe gets all speccy and spotty.Danny didn’t seem very pleasedabout our engagement.I've noticed that, too. Thought hemight be a bit jealous.Jealous?We're going to keep him away fromyou.I mean, what is supposed to orderfor starter, anyway?And how will I know what is astarter, or what is it not?We’ve been through this, Dad.It’ll be quite clearly marked onthe menu.Can’t the three of you just go onyour own. Leave me here.I’ll be perfectly happy with a tinof seven. Hello. Hello.Ready?I think you’ll like this place, Jack.Their wine list is as good asanything I’ve seen in London.Yes. Someone told me that.David, probably. Who else would ithave been?Madam.I was hoping you’d take us in this.Hey, you won’t want to drive inanything else after tonight.Mind you, it drinks petrol. Yes.I’m afraid We’ll have to stop on theway in to town. I feel like Eamonn Andrews. Is that a good thing?Eamonn Andrews is the poshest personthat Jack can imagine being.How are you tonight, sir? Very well.You might as well fill her up.I'm going to make a quick call. I’llbe two ticks.Do you think I should offer to helppay for the petrol?Would he be insulted, what do youthink?I know, he said tonight was histreat.But does that apply to the petrol,what do you think?I'm quiet sure, it does, Jack. Jack! Come on! It just came off. Filled my bill? Thank you, sir.Cheers.Jenny. Jenny...Take us home.What’s wrong?I'm afraid there’s been Jenny'shad a bit of a shock.What’s happened?  It’s just anotherone of David’s little muddlesand misunderstandings.I don’t want to hear another wordfrom anybody. Take us home. Now.Fine.You can take care of this, can’t you,David?Go inside, Dad.Mr and Mrs David Goldman,Mr and Mrs David Goldman,Mr and Mrs David You’re married!Legally, yes, but...When were you going to tell me?Soon. It just never seemed the righttime.You seemed so happy, and I washappy, and...You were living with your wife! Allthis time!Round the corner. Byron Avenue.It’s no wonder we kept bumping intoeach other, then, is it?What number? Thirty four.Don't be like this. Come on.I have nothing. I didn’t take myexams. I do I left school.Where’s it all gone, now?I can get a divorce.Everything will turn out for thebest.Go and tell them.Go and tell them, then go and tellyour wife.They won't listen now. All right?I'll come round tomorrow. Wheneveryone’s a bit calmer.Please don’t make me tell them on myown.You owe me that much. You owe themthat much.I owe them much more than that.Hey.Two minutes. And I’ll come out anddrag you in.What’s going on?He’s helping himself to some Dutchcourage before facing you.Stolen Dutch courage, from the lookof it.He has something he has to tell you.He just drove off.Can you tell us?Jenny? Please?I wouldn't worry about it too much.When I found out Not now Helen!I tried to tell him.I’m not speaking to him now, ifthat’s any consolation.It's a funny world you people livein.You both watched me carrying on witha married man,you don’t think it’s worth sayinganything about.Please, if you want thatconversation...You watched David and I helpourselves to a map,and you didn’t say much, either.Come on you. Let's go. Good boy.Hello.Hello. Sorry, I think I have a wrongnumber. I was looking for my...I wanted number of my cello lesson.Oh, no. Don’t tell me.Good God. You're a child.You didn’t know about any of this.Presumably.No. They never do.You’re not in the family way, areyou?Because that’s happened before.Thank God for that.No, no, you stay here. Did you see her? Yes. I saw her.I didn’t talk to her. There wasn’tany need.We have to have this out.If you won’t do it, I will. I’mstill your father.Oh, you’re my father again, are you?What were you when you encouraged meto throw my life away?Silly schoolgirls are always gettingseduced by glamorous older men.What about you two?Jenny?Jenny?Jenny, I'm sorry.I know I've made a mess ofeverything.All my life I’ve been scared,I didn’t want you to be scared.That’s why I wanted you to go toOxford.And then along came David...he knew famous writers,he knew how to get to classicalmusic concerts...But he wasn’t who he said he was.He wasn’t who you said he was,either.The other day, your mother and Iwere listening to...a programme on the radio aboutCS Lewis, and they saidthat he moved to Cambridge in .I said, Well, they’ve got that wrong,our Jenny wouldn't have his namein her book,if he moved to Cambridge.There’s a cup of tea, and somebiscuits out here.How do you think we can help?I want to repeat my last year atschool.  And take my exams.I got the impression the last timewe spokethat you didn’t see the point ofschool.Or of me, or of any of us here.I know. I was stupid.The life I want, there's noshortcut.I know now, that I need to go to theuniversity.It gives me absolutely no pleasurewhatsoeverto see our young schoolgirlsthrowing their lives away.Although, of course, you’re not oneof our schoolgirls any more.Through your own volition.I suppose you think I’m a ruinedwoman.You’re not a woman.No, I'm afraid, I think that theoffer of a place at this schoolwould be wasted on you.Come in.I didn't expect to see you again.This is lovely.All your books and pictures and...Paperbacks and postcards, Jenny.It’s all you need, isn’t it?Just somewhere to...I’m sorry I said those silly things.I didn’t understand.Let’s forget about it.A BurneJones.Do you like him?I do. Still.Still? You sound very old and wise.I feel old. But not very wise.Miss Stubbs, I need your help.I was so hoping that’s what you weregoing to say.Thank you, Marjorie.It's from Oxford.It is my pleasure to inform you thatyour application to read Englishat Oxford has been accepted.On behalf of the Faculty of Arts,staff of the university...So I went to read English books,and did my best to avoid the speccy,spotty fatethat Helen predicted for me.I probably looked as wideeyed,fresh, and artlessas any other student.But I wasn't.One of the boys I went out withand they really were boys,once asked me to go to Paris withhim.And I told him. And I'd love to,I was dying to see Paris.As if I'd never been.An.Education.DVDSCR.xViD, NoGrp, PrisM, xSCRpeejay@email.cz"
Avatar,2010,"When I was lying there in the VA hospital,with a big holeblown through the middle of my life,I started having these dreams of flying.I was free.Sooner or later, though,you always have to wake up.In cryo, you don't dream at all.It doesn't feel like six years.More like a fifth of teguilaand an asskicking.Tommy was the scientist, not me.He was the one who wanted to get shotlightyears out in spaceto find the answers.Are we there yet?Yeah, we're there, sunshine.We're there.It's about your brother.So, a weekbefore Tommy's gonna ship out,a guy with a gun ends his journeyfor the paper in his wallet.You've been in cryo for five years,nine months and  days.You will be hungry. You will be weak.If you feel nausea, please use the sacks…Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.Me, I'm just another dumb gruntgoing someplace he's gonna regret.Up ahead was Pandora.You grew up hearing about it,but I never figured I'd be going there.Your brother representeda significant investment.We'd like to talk to youabout taking over his contract.And since your genome is identicalto his, you could step into his shoes,so to speak.It'd be a fresh start on a new world.And the pay is good.Very good.— Exopacks on! Let's go! Exopacks on!— Exopacks on! Let's go!Remember, people, you lose that mask,you're unconscious in  seconds,you're dead in four minutes!Let's nobody be dead today!Looks very bad on my report.Hell's Gate tower,this is TAV  on approach.Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.One life ends,another begins.Harnesses off! Get your packs!— Put it together, let's go! Let's go!— Harnesses off! One minute!When that ramp comes down,go directly into the base. Do not stop!Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!There's no such thing as an exMarine.You may be out,but you never lose the attitude.I told myself I could passany test a man could pass.They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,but not on vet benefits,not in this economy.Let's go, special case!Do not make me wait for you!Well, well, ladies.Look at all this fresh meat!Back on Earth,these guys were Army dogs, Marines,fighting for freedom.Look out, hot rod!But out here they're just hired guns,taking the money,working for the company.Check this out, man.Meals on wheels.Oh, man, that is just wrong.I got two guys free in about  minutes!Got it! Need them !You're not in Kansas anymore.You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.Respect that factevery second of every day.If there is a hell,you might want to go there for some R&Rafter a tour on Pandora.Out there, beyond that fence,every living thingthat crawls, flies or squats in the mudwants to kill youand eat your eyes for Jujubes.We have an indigenous populationof humanoids called the Na'vi.They're fond of arrowsdipped in a neurotoxinthat'll stop your heart in one minute.And they have bones reinforcedwith naturally occurring carbon fiber.They are very hard to kill.As head of security,it is my job to keep you alive.I will not succeed.Not with all of you.If you wish to survive,you need to cultivatea strong mental attitude.You've got to obey the rules.Pandora rules.Rule number one…There's nothinglike an oldschool safety briefto put your mind at ease.Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.Wow! You look just like him.Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.I went through avatar training with him.… into the biolab.We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.— Hi.— Hey.Link… Here's the link room right here.This is wherewe're connecting to the avatar.Me and Norm are here to drivethese remotely controlled bodiescalled avatars.And they're grown from human DNAmixed with the DNA of the natives.— Hey. Welcome.— Hey.— Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.— Thanks.Damn! They got big.Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.So the proprioceptive simsseem to work really well.Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.It'll take us a few hoursto get them decanted,but you guys can take them out tomorrow.There's yours.Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.— Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.— Good to meet you, yeah.Looks like him.No, it looks like you.This is your avatar now, Jake.And the concept is that every driveris matched to his own avatar,so that their nervous systems are in tune,or something.Which is why they offered me the gig,because I can link with Tommy's avatar,which is insanely expensive.Is this right?I just say whatever to the video log?Yeah, we gotta get in the habitof documenting everything.You know, what we see, what we feel.— It's all part of the science.— And good science is good observation.Plus it'll help to keep you sanefor the next six years.All right. Whatever.So…Well, here I am,doing science.They're coming out!Attention. Drivers coming out of link.Oh, God.Where's the lab coat?Where's the lab coat?Who's got my goddamn cigarette?Guys! What's wrong with this picture?— Thank you!— Grace Augustine is a legend.She's the head of the Avatar Program.She wrote the book,I mean, literally wrote the bookon Pandoran botany.Well, that's 'cause she likes plantsbetter than people.Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.Grace, I'd like you to meetNorm Spellman and Jake Sully.Norm. I hear good things about you.How's your Na'vi?<font color=»#fcf»>May the All Mother… <font color=»#fcf»>… smile upon our first meeting.<font color=»#fcf»>Not bad . You sound a little formal.<font color=»#fcf»>I studied for five years… <font color=»#fcf»>… butthere is much to learn.— Grace? This is Jake Sully.— Ma'am.Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,and I don't need you. I need your brother.You know, the PhD who trainedfor three years for this mission?He's dead.I know it's a big inconveniencefor everyone.— How much lab training have you had?— I dissected a frog once.You see? You see?I mean, they're just pissing on uswithout even the courtesyof calling it rain.— I'm going to Selfridge.— No, Grace,— I don't think that's a good idea.— No, man, this is such bullshit!I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.He has no businesssticking his nose in my department.Here tomorrow, .Try and use big words.Scorpion TwoHotel, Hell's Gate tower.You are cleared for south departure.Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.— You see that?— Yes, sir.No, you didn't.You were looking at the monitor.I love this putter, Ronnie!I love this putter.Parker, you know,I used to think it was benign neglect,but now I seethat you're intentionally screwing me.Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.I need a researcher.Not some jarhead dropout.Well, actually,I thought we got lucky with him.— Lucky?— Yeah.How is this in any way lucky?Lucky your guy had a twin brother,and lucky that brother wasn'tsome oral hygienist or something.A Marine we can use.I'm assigning himto your team as security escort.The last thing I need is anothertriggerhappy moron out there!Look, look,you're supposed to be winning the heartsand the minds of the natives.Isn't that the whole point ofyour little puppet show?If you look like themand you talk like them,then they'll start trusting us.We build them a school,we teach them English,but after, what, how many years?Relations with the indigenousare only getting worse.Yeah, that tends to happenwhen you use machine guns on them.Right. Come here.I can't… I can't…This is why we're here. Unobtanium.Because this little gray rock sellsfor  million a kilo.That's the only reason.It's what pays for the whole party.It's what pays for your science.Now, those savagesare threatening our whole operation,we're on the brink of war,and you're supposed to be findinga diplomatic solution.So use what you've got,and get me some results.So, how much link time have you logged?— About  hours.— That's good.You're in there.You're here. How much have you logged?Zip. But I read a manual.Tell me you're joking.This is cool.Let's go.Don't. I got this.So you just figured you'd come out here,to the most hostile environmentknown to man,with no training of any kind,and see how it went?What was going through your head?Maybe I was sick of doctorstelling me what I couldn't do.— Biometrics are good.— Link three is ready.Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.Down. Just relaxand let your mind go blank.That shouldn't be hard for you.Kiss the darkest part of my lily white…Initiate link.Run sequence unit three. Go.Launching.I have the first congruency.— That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.— Go figure.Phaselock % .All right. Going in.I'm going in in four.Phaselock % . Link is stable.He's in. Jake, can you hear me?Can you hear me, Jake?Pupillary reflex is good.Pinna response normal.How you feeling, Jake?Hey, guys.Welcome to your new body, Jake.Good!Yeah, we're gonna take thisnice and easy, Jake.— And touch your thumb to your fingers.— Yeah.— Thumb to your fingers.— No problem.That's good.I can see you can remember that one.— Got it.— Well, if you want to sit up,— that's fine.— Okay, good. Just take itnice and slow, Jake. Good.Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?You're wiggling your toes!— Good. Good, Jake.— That's great.Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.Are you feeling any numbness or pain?That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.Take it easy.Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?There's a few more sensorymotor reflex tests we need to run,— so take it easy.— Wait.— Jake.— Sit down, Jake.Jake! Listen to me. Jake!— I need you to sit down. Jake!— It's okay.— Buddy, listen to me.— It's all good. I got this.— Jake, you need to sit down right now.— Guys, get him back on the gurney now.Listen to me.For your own safety, you need to sit down.You need time to adjust to the avatar…Whoa ! Jake!— God, Jake, watch your tail.— Yeah!Sedate! Sedate him ! A thousandmilligrams of Supitocam ! Stat!Guys! Guys! Whoa ! Whoa !By the numbers.— Jake. Come on.— Jake! Listen to me.You're not used to your avatar body.— This is dangerous.— This is great.— Jake? Jake, listen to me.— Come on. They're gonna put you out.— Norm, sit down.— No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.God damn it! Bring them home!— Norm ! Do not leave control!— You're not ready for it!— Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.— So close!I don't even have to play defense on it.Hey, guys. Hey.— It's okay, I'll get him.— Jake, you have to come back!Jake! Jake! Excuse me.— Watch it!— Sorry!Come on!Jake! We're not supposed to be running!— Jeez! Sorry.— Watch it!Hey, Marine!Damn.— Grace?— Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?Think fast.Motor controI's looking good.Come on, everybody, quiet down!All right, gang, lights out.Come on, Louise, chopchop.Hey, hey, hey!Don't play with that, you'll go blind.That's kind of freaky.Come on. Scat.Good night.Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.Welcome back.— You okay? You all right?— Yeah, I'm okay.I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.And this here is my baby.Hold on a second.Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!— We bounce at zeronine.— Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!Vine strike's still loose.You guys are packing some heavy gear.Watch it!Yeah, that's 'cause we're notthe only thing flying around out there.Or the biggest.I'm gonna need you on a door gun.I'm a man short.I thought you'd never ask.There's your man.See you on the flight line.You wanted to see me, Colonel?This low gravity'll make you soft.You get soft,Pandora will shit you out deadwith zero warning.I pulled your record, Corporal.Venezuela, that was some mean bush.Nothing like this here, though.You got some heart, kid,showing up in this neighborhood.I figured it's just another hellhole.I was First Recon myself.A few years ahead of you.Well, maybe more than a few.Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.I come out here?Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?Yeah. They could fix me up,if I rotated back.Yeah, and make me pretty again.But you know what? I kind of like it.It reminds me every daywhat's waiting out there.The Avatar Program is a bad joke.Bunch of limpdick science majors.However, it does present an opportunityboth timely and unique.— Clear!— Clear!A recon gyrene in an avatar body.That's a potent mix.Give me the goose bumps.Such a Marine could providethe intel I need,right on the ground.Right in the hostiles' camp.Look, Sully. I want youto learn these savages from the inside.I want you to gain their trust.I need to knowhow to force their cooperationor hammer them hard if they won't.— Am I still with Augustine?— On paper.Yeah, you walk like one of herscience pukes, you quack like one,but you report to me.Can you do that for me, son?Hell, yeah, sir.Well, all right, then.Son, I take care of my own.You get me what I need,I'll see to it you get your legs backwhen you rotate home.Your real legs.That sounds real good, sir.— Link's ready!— Phaselock % .Just keep your mouth shutand let Norm do the talking.I have five congruencies. Phaselock % .Link three ready.All right, I'm going in.Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.— Norm ! Your pack.— Pack.Stay with the ship.One idiot with a gun is enough.You the man, Doc.Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.So, how will they know we're here?I'm sure they're watching us right now.— Keep moving, Norm.— Keep up, guys!— And here I go.— Scanning.Wow! It's that fast?— Amazing, isn't it?— Yeah.So, that is signal transductionfrom this rootto the root of the tree next to it.So, we should take a sample.Okay. Sample.You know, it's probably electrical,based on the speed of the reaction.Norm, you've contaminatedthe sample with your saliva.Right.So, here I go.Don't shoot.Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.It's already pissed off.Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.It's a territorial threat display.Do not run, or he'll charge.So, what do I do, dance with it?Just hold your ground.Yeah? Come on! What you got?Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.That's right,get your punk ass back to mommy.Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.You keep running.Yeah, and why don't you bring backsome of your friends, huh?Oh, shit.So what about this one?Run? Don't run? What?Run! Definitely run!I'm gonna have to call it, guys.We're not allowed to run night ops.Colonel's orders.I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have tohang on till morning.He won't make it till morning.I don't have all goddamn night.Come on! Come on!Hey, wait. Don't!Great.Look, I know you probably don'tunderstand this,but thank you.Thank you.That was pretty impressive.I would have been screwedif you hadn't come along. It was…Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?Wait up!Just… Hey, slow down.Look, wait up, I just wanted to saythanks for killing those things.— Damn!— Don't thank.You don't thank for this.This is sad. Very sad only.Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.Whatever I did, I am sorry.All this is your fault.They did not need to die.My fault? They attacked me.How am I the bad guy?Your fault!— Your fault!— Easy. Easy.You're like a baby.Making noise, don't know what to do.Easy.Fine. Fine.If you love your little forest friends,why not let them just kill my ass?What's the thinking?— Why save you?— Yeah. Yeah, why save me?You have a strong heart.No fear.But stupid! Ignorant like a child.Well, if I'm like a child, then…Look, maybe you should teach me.Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.Well, then teach me how to See.— No one can teach you to See.— Whoa.Look, come on, can't we talk?Say, where'd you learn to speak English?Dr. Augustine's school?You're like a baby.I need your help.You should not be here.— Okay, take me with you.— No!

Look.Killing the indigenous looks bad,but there's one thing that shareholdershate more than bad press,and that's a bad quarterly statement.I didn't make up the rules.So just find me a carrotthat'll get them to move,otherwise it's gonna have to beall stick. Okay?You got three months.That's when the 'dozers get there.Well, we're wasting time.I like this guy.— Guys, right now…— Okay, let's run through them again.Mo'at. Dragon lady.— Eytucan.— Eytukan.

It's a network.It's a global network,and the Na'vi can access it.They can upload and download data.Memories.At sites like the one you just destroyed.Yes!What the hell have you peoplebeen smoking out there?They're just goddamn trees!— You need to wake up, Parker.— No. You need to wake up.The wealth of this world isn'tin the ground.

Lite beer?And blue jeans?There's nothing that we havethat they want.Everything they sent me out here to dois a waste of time.They're never gonna leave Hometree.So, since a deal can't be made,I guess things get real simple.Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.I might just give you a big wet kiss.I'll do it with minimal casualtiesto the indigenous.I'll drive them out with gas first.It'll be humane.More or less.All right, let's pull the trigger.— Come on, people.— Oh, man.Let's pack it up, let's go.This is how it's done.When people are sittingon shit that you want,you make them your enemy.Then you're justified in taking it.Quaritch is rolling the gunships.He's gonna hit Hometree.My God.— Dr. Augustine!

Sisters!And we will show the Sky Peoplethat they cannot take whatever they want,and that this,this is our land!Yah!Yah!Yah!We rode out to the four winds.To the horse clans of the plain.Back to the stars!To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.For our children's children!When Toruk Macto called them, they came.Yah!Everyone on this base, every one of you,is fighting for survival.That's a fact!There's an aboriginal horde out theremassing for an attack.Now, these orbital images tell methat the hostiles' numbershave gone from a few hundredto well over , in one day.And more are pouring in.ln a week's time,there could be , of them.At that point,they will overrun our perimeter.Well, that's not gonna happen!Our only security liesin preemptive attack.We will fight terror with terror.Now, the hostiles believethat this mountain stronghold of theirsis protected by their…Their deity.And when we destroy it,we will blast a craterin their racial memory so deepthat they won't comewithin , klicks of this place ever again.And that, too, is a fact.Yeah! Yeah.Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.They've got these huge palletsof mine explosives.It's for some kindof shockandawe campaign.Fricking daisy cutters!Quaritch has taken over.He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.— When?—  tomorrow.— Max! Max!— I gotta go.We're screwed!And I was hopingfor some sort of tactical planthat didn't involve martyrdom.We're going up against gunshipswith bows and arrows.I have  clans out there.That's over , warriors.Now, we know these mountains.We fly them. You fly them. They don't.Their instruments won't work up here.Missile tracking won't work.They'll have to fire a line of sight.lf they bring the fight to us,then we have the homefield advantage.You know he's gonna commit that bomberstraight to the Tree of Souls.Yeah, I know.lf they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.That's their direct line to Eywa,their ancestors.It'll destroy them.Then I guess we'd better stop him.I'm probably just talkingto a tree right now.But if you're there,I need to give you a headsup.lf Grace is with you,look into her memories.See the world we come from.There's no green there.They killed their Mother.And they're gonna do the same here.More Sky People are gonna come.They're gonna comelike a rain that never ends.Unless we stop them.Look, you chose me for something.I will stand and fight.You know I will.But I need a little help here.Our Great Motherdoes not take sides, Jake.She protects only the balance of life.It was worth a try.Yeah!

Good.Over to you, Lieutenant.Supplies, Gentlemen.Map, torches, grenades,and a couple of little treats.Leave immediately, take this trench west,up on Sauchiehall Street,then northweston Paradise Alley at the front.Continue along the front lineuntil you find the Yorks.Give this note to Major Stevenson.He's holding the lineat the shortest spanof No Man's Land.You'll cross there.It will be daylight, Sir.They'll see us.There's no need to be concerned.You should meet no resistance.Sir, is it just us?""Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne,He travels the fastest who travels alone."" Wouldn't you say, Lieutenant? Yes, Sir. I would.Good luck.Blake  let's talk about thisfor a minute.Why?Blake!We just need to think about it.There's nothing to think about.He's my big brother.We should at least waituntil it's dark.Erinmore said to leave immediately.Erinmore's never seenNo Man's Land.We won't make it  yards.If we just wait.You heard him.He said the Boche have gone.Is that why he gave us grenades? Watch where you're going! Sorry.All I'm saying is that we wait.Yes, you would say that,because he's not your brother, is it?Look, the last time I was toldthe Germans were gone, it didn't end well.You don't know, Blake,you weren't there.Excuse me. Excuse me!You're going up a down trenchyou bloody idiots.Orders of the General, Sir.Alright, say the Boche have gone.Nine miles will take us, what, six hours?Eight at the very most.So, we've got timeto wait until the sun sets...It's enemy territory, we've gotno idea what we're walking into.Blake, if we're not clever about this,no one will get to your brother.I will.We're here.This is the front line.Now we need to find the Yorks. Watch who you're shoving. Get out of the way then.Who the fuck do you think you are,pushing wounded soldiers around?Let go of me!Arsehole knocked down our Sergeant,the man's fucking wounded!I'm sorry, alright, I'm sorry. We're on commission. Just let me through. Orders from the General. Just let me through.Get out of the way.Right. Just watchwhere you're going.It's bloody quiet.Was it like this before Thiepval?I don't remember.You don't remember the Somme?Not really.Well, you did alright out of it.At least wear your ribbon.Don't have it anymore.What? You lost your medal?It's down, boys.Stay low.God's sake, careful there,you're stepping on the dead.That's our Sergeant.Be better washing them out of thisdugout with a bloody hose.Do you know where the Yorks are?The next bend you'll be standingon top of half of them.Shot to hell two nights ago.Yorks?Yes, Corp.Where's Major Stevenson?Was killed a couple of nights ago,Corporal.Lieutenant Leslie has command.Where can we find him?Next dugout.Here.Sir? Lieutenant Leslie, Sir?What is it?We have a messagefrom General Erinmore. Are you our relief? No, Sir.Then, when the fucking hellare they due?We don't know, Sir.But we've got orders to cross here. That is the German front line. We know, Sir.If you'll just take the letter.Settle a bet, what day is it?Friday.Friday? Well, well, well.None of us was right.This idiot thought it was Tuesday.Sorry, Sir.Are they out of their fucking minds?One slow night, and the brass thinkthe Hun have just gone home.Do you think they're wrong, Sir?We lost an officerand three men two nights ago.They were shot to bitspatching up wire.We dragged two of them back here.Needn't have bothered.Sir, the General is surethe enemy have withdrawn.There are aerialsof the new line...Shut up. We've fought and diedover every inch of this fucking place,now they suddenly give us miles?It's a trap.But, chin up.There's a medal in it for sure.Nothing like a scrap of ribbonto cheer up a widow.Alright.Where's the nearestway through, Sir?Our wire's a mess.But there is a path through, of sorts.Rushworth! Let him look.Straight ahead, to the left,past the dead horses.There's a gap directly behind them.Useful, because if it's darkyou follow the stench.When you get to the second wire,look out for the bowing chap.There's small breakjust beside him.The German lineis a  odd yards after that.Watch out for the craters.They're deeper than they look.You fall in, there's no getting out.This way.Wake up, Kilgour.Bloody waste of space.Any cover, Sir?Anywhere to jump off from?No, the sap trenchwas blown to hell weeks ago.It's full of bodies anyway.Your best bet is to pop over here.If you do get shot,try to make it back to the wire.We won't come after you,not until it's dark.And, if by some fucking miracleyou do make it, send up a flare.Don't have any, Sir.Well, get him one, Kilgour!Make yourself useful.Yes, Sir.""Through this holy unctionmay the Lord pardon theeall faults or whatever sinsthou hast committed.""I do hate losing these to the Hun.So, when they start shooting at you,could you be so kind as tothrow it back, there's a good chap.Cheerio.You sure?Yes.Age before beauty.You alright?Look for cover.Sap trench.Alright.Stay still.They're ours.Keep going. We're halfway.There's a gap in the wire.Sco...There! That's the front line.Fuck me. They really have gone.Your hand alright?Put it through an effing German.Patch it up.You'll be wanking againin no time.Wrong hand.They're not long gone.No good.Blocked.This might be a way through.Jesus...Look at this. It's massive.They built all this.Here's our way through.Sco.How about this?Bloody hell!Even their ratsare bigger than ours.What do you thinkis in the bags?You cannot be that hungry.Look at him. Cocky little bastard.You could eat this, though. What is it? Boche dog meat.What's in the other boxes?What's wrong?Trip wire. Don't move.Where is it?Goes from here to the door.Jesus!No!

Just don't.I didn't knowwhat I was picking you for.I thought they were going to send us backup the line, or for food, or something.I thought it was going to besomething easy, alright?I never thought it would be this.So, do you want to go back?Just fire the fucking flare.Up yours, Lieutenant.Do you know where we are?Ecoust is directly southeast.And if we keep that bearing,we should make it.Come on then.Look at that.They destroyed their own guns.They destroyedtheir own trenches too.What do you mean?I think they wanted us to go that way.They wanted to bury us.Bastard rats.Hey, did you hear that storyabout Wilko?How he lost his ear?I'm not in the mood.Keep your eyes on the trees,top of the ridge.Bet he told you it was shrapnel.What was it then?Well, you know his girl'sa hairdresser, right?And he was moaning about the lack ofbathing facilities when he wrote to her remember those rancidJakes at Arras?Anyway, she sends him overthis 'hair oil'.Smells sweet, like Golden Syrup.Wilko loves the smell,but he doesn't want tocart it around in his pack, sohe slathers it all over his barnet,goes to sleep,and in the middle of the nighthe wakes up,and a rat is sitting on his shoulderlicking the oil off of his head.Wilko panics, and he jumps up,and when he does the rat bites clean throughhis fucking ear and runs off with it!Oh, he made a hell of a fuss,yelling, screaming.The best of it was he could putso much bloody oil on himselfthat he couldn't wash it off!He was like a magnet.Rats left us alone,but they couldn't get enough of him.Poor bastard.Heading back home.I wonder what they saw.Watch the ridge lines.Well, that's your medalsorted then.What do you mean?""Lance Corporal Blake showedunusual valour in rescuinga comrade from certain death""blah, blah, blah.You reckon?I do.Well, that'd be nice.Since you lost yours.I didn't lose mine.

I'm his wife.Welcome to the  Willow Springs  cars will be competingin this  lap race.Hey Ken,what happened to your shield?New design.Well, it looks like we're about to begin.The cars have completed the warmup lap.The green flag is out.And they're approaching the starting line.Here we go.Bloody hell!Learn to drive, you pillock!So, Shelby, you miss it?Hey, Sam.Guy wins the  Hour of Le Mans.Suddenly retires, starts selling cars.It just don't make sense.Well, unless the rumors are true,of course.What rumors would those be, Sam?That Carroll Shelby quit driving'cause he lost his nerve.I'm gonna out brake yaon the next turn, Bob.Nice try, BobNice move from Ken Miles. laps remaining,with Phil Hill andDan Gurney in the lead.It's been an incredible dayhere at Willow Springs.And we've seen some exciting driving.With just  lap remainingin this  lap race.We're coming to the final stretch.Dan Gurney has been leadingthe pack for the most of the...Woah!Red Faris is off the track.That leaves Dan Gurney for the lead,followed by journeyman Ken Miles.Now for you, Dan.And they're comingaround the last turn.Gurney is still in the leadwith Ken Miles hot on his heel.Miles is looking for an opening.Not yet.Come on!Can Gurney hold him offin the final straight?Not yet.Gurney is blocking him out.Now.Nice move, Ken.They're wheel to wheel.Come on!An incredible finish for Ken Miles.Didn't see that one coming.He's difficult but good.That calls for a nice cup of tea. I've got the kettle on. Hop in.Pops, frame this.Hey.We did it!What's wrong?The IRS came.They've padlocked the garage.All right, Petey.Couple of years ago,you said we'd a nestegg.Correct. A couple of years ago. Correct.So, just to be clear,we are buggered.Absolutely.As in totally?As in not a beanor a pot in which to piss.Spares, stock, all gone.Tools, my tools are locked up in there.I'll figure something out.In , our soldiers came home.What was the first thingthat they did?They had sex. years later, those babies,they've grown.They've got jobs,they've got licenses.But they do not wanna drivethe same dull 's carstheir parents drove.You see, kids today, they want glamor.They want, eh, sex appeal.They wanna go fast.Gentlemen,it's time for the Ford Motor Companyto go racing.We're already in racing, Iacocca.NASCAR? It's regional, sir.If you go to the movies,you open up a magazine, you don't seegood ol' boys in WinstonSalem.You seeSophia Loren,Monica Vitti.James Bond does notdrive a Ford, sir.That's because he's a degenerate.See?God, I'd like to be a degenerate.Just give me one second, please.Is this part of it? Is this going anywhere, Iacocca? Sorry, sir. All right, Alright. That's enough. Sir, if you just bear with me...Turn it off, lights!Lee, in the last  years,you and your marketing teamhave presided overthe worst sale slump in US history.Why exactly shouldMr. Ford listen to you?Because we've been thinking wrong.Ferrari.Now they've won  outof the last  Le Mans.We need to think like Ferrari.Ferrari makes fewer cars in a yearthan we make in a day.We spend more on toilet paperthan they do on their entire output.You want us to think like them?Enzo Ferrari will go down in historyas the greatest carmanufacturer of all time.Why?Is it because he built the most cars?No.It's because of what his cars mean.Victory.Ferrari wins at Le Mans.People they...They want some of that victory.What if the Ford badge meant victory?And meant it where it counts with thefirst group of yearolds in history, with money in their pockets. This would take years.Decades to test and develop a race teamcapable of taking on Ferrari.Ferrari's bankrupt.Enzo spent every lire he's got chasingperfection, and you know something?He got there.But now he's broke.You don't have to give up racingto get a bloody day job, Ken.I think I do.I've had my fun, it's timeto put food on the table and grow up.The garage didn't pay the pills.Now it's locked up.Racing doesn't pay them eitherand I keep winning.Yeah, because you're good.But I can't play the game.I'm not what they call 'a people person'.You don't say.And I'm  years old,Do you really think I'm gonna change?I'm never gonna get the good rides.I started too late.Because you foughtin the bloody war!If you stop,you'd be bloody insufferable.It was quick going 'round the region.It's over.Let's look on the bright side.Now I can get fat and old,trim the roses and eat pork pies.Scuzi, please.No photos, prego.Relax.You gotta understand.This is like the Mafia showing upto buy the Statue of Liberty.Kind of the opposite, actually.If the Press gets wind of this,the shit will hit the Fangio. Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor. Franco Gozzi, Ferrari.Sonno queste...Your journalist?No, no, Mr. Iacocca.It's our cameras, just for history.Four liter Colombo engine.One man assemblesthe entire engine by himself.Another man assembles the transmission.Everything handbuilt.Bellissimo.Racing department.Lee, that's him.This merger between our companieswill form two entities.FordFerarri, % owned by Fordwho controls all production.Secondly, FerarriFord, the race team.% owned by Ferrari.In order to secure thisFord will pay the sum... million dollars.Excuse me.He will need some time to read this.Please.Yeah, of course.All done, thank you.Only one small question.It concerns my race program.If I wish to race Le Mans and youdo not wish for me to race Le Mans,Do we or do we not go?In that highly unlikely scenario,if we just can't agree then, yes.I mean, no.You are correct.You do not go.My integrity as a constructor,as a man, as an Italianis deeply insulted by your proposal.Go back to Michigan.Back to your big ugly factory.Back to your big ugly factorymaking its ugly little cars.Tell your pigheaded boss that all his...smug executives areworthless sons of whores.Tell him he's not Henry Ford.He is Henry Ford the second.He played us.Old man Enzo had no intentionof selling to us.He used us to up his price.Embarrass our company,insult your leadership.It was a bad idea from the start.What exactly did he say?He said Ford makes ugly little cars,and we make 'em in an ugly factory.He said our executives aresons of whores.About me.He called you fat, sir.Pigheaded.Go on.He said you're not Henry Ford.You're Henry Ford the second.I want the best engineers.The best drivers.I don't care what it costs.We're gonna build a race car.And we're gonna burythat goddamn greasy wopa hundred feet deepunder the finish line at Le Mans.And I will be there to watch it.Here they come.Go, go, go! Asshole! You're really pathetic!I'm so sorry, girls.Charlie, quit throwingcrackers at the girlsall damn day, goddammit. Do I gotta deal with this? It's already taken care of.Sorry about that. So, yeah.  cubic inch V. Far out.Extensive rework of AC Ace's front endand a stronger rear diffto handle the torque.How'd she handle the quarter mile?Well, I'm not sayingyou should go drag racing.But quarter mile is .. Yeah. Is that good? That's real good.He sold that same car times this week. You take cash? Is cash okay? Cash is okay.Yeah, mister, you just bought yourself one hell of a sport car. Alright.I'll tell you what, I'm gonna...Phil.I'm gonna pass you off to my colleaguehere, he gonna take care of you.Phil, Wyatt.I'll steal him for one second.You take the payment.Whatever you do, do not let him takethat car, that's Jeff Blitzer's car.And Frank Collins's,and Steve McQueen's.Shit, I forgot about McQueen.Morning, can I help you?Carroll Shelby.Maybe.Lee Iacocca, Ford Motor.What's with the wrench?That? Long story.We are just goin'from strength to strength here, Lee.Terrific sales.We're killing it on the track. Now..Now I know I owe Fordfor that last batch of engines...Mr. Shelby, I can assure youI'm not here for moneythat you might oweFord for spare parts.You're not?No, I'm not.Okay.I'm here on behalf of Mr. Ford,Henry Ford II.Suppose, hypothetically,he wanted his companyto win the  Hours of Le Mans.You're one of the only Americansthat's ever done it.I'm wondering, what's it take?Hypothetically?Hypothetically.Well, it'll take something money can't buy.Money can buy speed.It isn't about speed, Lee.It's not just like those othertracks where all you do isturn to the left for  hours.To win that race, you need a carthat's light enough to do on the straightaways,but strong enough to keep that upfor  miles without a break.Not just the best car y'all have ever made,but better than anything that Enzo Ferrari shows up with that year.And that just getsyou to the green flag,that's where yourproblems really start. Is everything okay? Go away.So, you're saying it's challenging.Look, it's not even a track, Lee.Le Mans' . miles of country road.It's narrow, ungraded. It's rough.There's no camber on the turns, no rails.You gotta do that for  hours. hours, Lee.That means night.Half of that race is in the dark,you can't see shit.Cars coming up on you out of nowhere.Drivers stumblin' around the track,pourin' blood.Maybe one of 'em's your friend,maybe he's on fire.You're exhausted, you're hungry.Can't remember your name,what country you're in,and all of a sudden you realizeyou're doing  on the straight.And if anything goes wrong.You blow a gasket,  cent washer.That's it, whole thing's over.Ferrari wins again.Just like it won last year.The year before that,and the year before that.Yeah, it's challenging.You don't think thatFord Motor Company can buildthe greatest race carthe world's ever seen?You think that we are incapableof winning an event like that?Even if we had a brilliant partner?Even if we wrote a blank check?What I'm saying isyou can't buy a win, Lee,but maybe you could buy the guywho gets you a shot.A new transmission.Axles, shocks all around.Ditch the body and the tires,you have yourself a contender.Anything on this beautythat does work?The mirrors are outstanding.I saw that walking up.So, what? You're justpassing or evening stroll?Actually, bulldog,I have a proposition for you.You gonna build a carto beat old man Ferrari?With Ford. With a Ford?Correct.And how long did you tell themthat you needed?Two, three hundred years? days.All right, so, let's just lookat this for a moment.And for argument's sake,let's just forget aboutthe whole  day thing.Let's just pretend you gotall the money in the worldand all the time in the world. I like the sound of that. Alright, so.You think that Fordare gonna let you buildthe car that you wantthe way you want it?The Ford Motor Company?Those guys?Have you ever been to Detroit? I mean,they have floors and floors of lawyers,and millions of marketing guys,and they're all gonna wanna meet you,all of them gonna wanna get their phototaken with the great Carroll Shelby,and they're gonna kiss your arseand they're gonna go backto their lovely offices,and they're gonna work outnew ways to screw you.Why? Because they can't help it.Because they just wannaplease their boss,who wants to please his boss,who wants to please his boss.And they hate themselves for it, but deep down,who they hate evenmore, are guys like you,because you're not like them,because you don't think like them,because you're different.It's coming straight from the Deuce.He's serious.They're gonna put real money behind it.I bet they are.You know why? Because someone,and I'm not saying who.Someone has told themthat this is actually possible.Look, this Sunday at Cloverfield,they're launching the new Mustang.They're gonna announce the race program.Just come on by.Come take a look.Listen to my speech.I'm making a speech.Bring Peter, he'll love it.Alright, Shel.See you Sunday.Woah.Dad, look at that.Ford Mustang. What do you think?I think it's a secretary's car.I like it.Oh, excuse me, excuse me.Would you not do that?Sorry. Oh, is this your son? Yes, it is.Would you ask himto keep his hands off the paintwork?No, no, Petey, you're okay.Who are you?Leo Beebe, Senior Executive Vice President,Ford Motor Company.I am responsiblefor the launch of the Mustang.Well, at least now weknow who's responsible. Don't get me wrong, Lenny. Leo.It looks fantastic butinside it's a lump of larddressed up to fool the public.My advice is: lose the inline and that idiotic  speed,shorten the wheelbase.Somehow lose half a ton. And lower the price. Dad.But even thenI'll still choose the Chevy Chevelle.That's a fucking terrible car.How're we doing up there, Steve?There's Cloverfield, Mr. Shelby.Oh, yeah.You mind if I take a shotat the landing?No no, I mean it. I flew Bsoutta San Antonio in '. You're kidding. I did.Okay.Carroll, what are you doing? Does he know how to fly? Carroll.I had an instructor tell meLook Don, I would sayit's probably a good time to buckle up.Do everybody a favorand stay on the ground.That's a true story.This is the car you neverexpected from Detroit.Alright, let's go.Not staying, Ken?Nah, it's a bloody pig in a poke, isn't it?Oh, here they come now. Wait, are they crashing? Oh, lord.Who's the pilot?My guess, Peter...Someone we know.Everything all right up there?Oh, no! Hang on.Shit!Shit!Tell you what,that's like riding a bike.Talk about making an entrance.Good grief. Shelby! Over here!How're y'all doin'.Can we get an autograph, sir?Shelby, this is Roy Lunn.Ol' Roy here is developingthe prototype over in England.Oh hell, I know Roy.Good to see you, Roy.Welcome to the madhouse, Shelby.Ford wheeled out the entireexecutive committee for this one.Hold that thought. Ah. Hello, Mr. Lindbergh.You like that?Hey, Peter, how're you doing? Mr. Shelby. Good to see you.Are you building a carthat's gonna beat Ferrari?Well, we're gonna go to Le Mans,that's for sure.And if we get across that finishline first we gonna win.Carroll, allow me to introduce Leo Beebe,Senior Vice President Ford Motor.Oh, sure, yeah. Please Mr. Beebe. Thank you for coming.Say hello to Ken Milesand his son Peter. We... Right.We met.Yeah. Didn't we? So, um...I'll take Petey for some pop.Good luck with these guys, Shel. Bye, Mr. Shelby. See you, Pete.Don't worry, he's gonna stay.So, you two get a chanceto talk on the plane?Yeah, Carroll, why don't we just, step this way for a second.Look, it's pro forma,it's window dressing.But there's gotta be a sense of gettingthe tape between you and you know. No, I don't. The group.The group?Senior creatives, Carroll.Just to make sure everybody's comfortable.I'm confused, Lee.'Cause up until this momentright now I was comfortable.Why don't you take a lookout there, Carroll?What do you see?Do you know what I see?I see a machine.I see ten thousand moving partsmoving, hopefully, in harmony.And it's my job to make it so.It's my job to guide you through it.I'm here to help you, Carroll.But you gotta trust me. Excuse me, Lee. Carroll.Do not step on that stageif you don't trust me.Please, welcome Mr. Carroll Shelby.Gotta go. What'd he say? He gets the drill.Thank you.If my Daddy was here today,he'd tell me to sit on downand leave the yackin' to the college boys.Like my cars, I'll make this fast.When I was  years old,Pops said to me, ""Son,it's a truly lucky man who knowswhat he wants to do in this world.""'Cause that man will never worka day in his life.But there are a few, a precious few,and hell I don't knowif they're lucky or not,but there are a few peoplewho find something they have to do.Something obsesses them.Something if they can't do it,it's gonna drive themclean outta their mind.I'm that guy.And I know one other manfeels exactly the same.His name...His name is Mr. Henry Ford.And together we're gonna buildthe fastest automobile in the world.And we're gonna makehistory too, at Le Mans. Let's go. What?My name is Carroll Shelby.I build race cars.No. Whatever it is, no.No. minutes.Ah, I just...I'm spent, I wanna have a bath.You gonna wanna see this.Trust me. minutes. I'll have you backfor meatloaf and gravy.  minutes. Yeah.Bloody hell.Fresh off the plane from England.Now,She's still a littleon the rare side of cooked.Come on.Interesting.Well? It's awful. It's worse than awful.It doesn't track.The rd gear is too high,torque is not reaching the road.Steering's loose becausethe front end gets light.At over  it thinks it's... Airplane. Yeah.It wants to lift off and fly to Hawaii.Anything else?One second.You were back late last night.Yeah.Were you working?So you didn't go any place.What?I'm asking, did you goany place last night?Mollie.It's a simple question.And I answered, didn't I?What was the answer?Is something up, love?What are you doing?What are you doing?You're driving very fast.Am I? Am I?Yes, you are!Bloody hell!What are you? What is this?You tell me 'cause I dunno.What? Slow down!Whoa, whoa, Mollie!Please, Slow it down! Alright?You're trying to kill us or something? I thought we love this shit. What?Bloody hell! It's a bit of racing fun, no? No no no, it's not the same at all!Well I think it's thrilling!Alright.Look, I saw you, all right?I saw you leaving with Shelby,and I saw you coming back.Okay, shit, okay.Slow down.And then all day you gotthat stupid look on your face.Mollie, slow down!You're too close in.Mollie, put on the brakes right now!Not until you tellme what's going on!Alright, I went to look at a car. With Shelby? With Shelby. A racing car? Sort of.There's a corner coming,you better hold on.Mol, are you gonna lift your foot offat all through this?No. 'Cause I like a clean racing line.Slow down!Okay. Shel offered me a job.Ford has a carthat they wanna put upagainst Ferrari. You told me you were done! I didn't say yes! Slow down! You told me you quit! I don't understand. Get fat and old you said!Fat and old! I don't understand. That's what you told me!I don't understand.Are you upset because I said I was doneor because I looked at a race car?Just don't lie to me again!Don't make it a secret,what you want or what you feeljust because you thinkit's gonna make me happy!Mol, I don't even know what I feel.If you do thisthey better be paying you this time.'Cause I can't work any more hoursand look after Peter.The IRS have the garage,I'm not losing my home.It's  a dayplus expenses.Are you shitting me?But, I haven't decided. dollars a day?Are you nuts?This is ridiculous.Grabbing air. That's the problem.Over , air's getting in, not getting out.It's the nose.I can feel it in the wheel.Mr. Miles, if there's a problemthe computer will find it.Charlie, get some scotch tapeand a ball of wool.Alright.Good, good good. So now let's justget all of this junk out.All right, Pops?Yeah, yeah. I concur.Come on guys.What are they doing?Making your car faster.There, right there.Airflow's getting stuck.I see it. Yarn blows straight up. Yep. Front's lifting. Damn, he's right.This car wants to go faster. I feel it.Any lighter we're getting fragile.We took  pounds outof her in the last week.She's outputting max horsepowerfrom this displacement. So put in a bigger engine. Where we gonna put it? On the roof?Managed to make it  pounds lighterthan the NASCAR unit.All new aluminum cylinder heads.Vibration dampers, Water pump,Smaller valves.We call it 'The Beast'.I can see why, but how's it gonna fitwithout redesigning the engine bed?Well, it certainly wasn't easy.Good Morning, gentlemen, Mr. Shelby.So, you already put that in a GT?I'm afraid we have.I'll be damned.Well, it's heavy, of course.Problems with the handling especiallythe stopping. I can show you the data.What problem? Understeers a little, but... Can I borrow that?Just a second, thank you.Ken, Ken!Perhaps we ought to checkwith HQ before you take... What'd he say? We should ask...Alright.Oh, yes!Mr. Shelby. Welcome to Dearborn.What are you doingat a test track?You're gonna get Castrolall over that nice suit.I want to hear your thoughtson a few planning decisions.You know, personnel for Le Mans.Well, It's a hell of a line up,Ken Miles, Phil Hill,Chris Amon, Bruce McLaren.Hill's a lock,  Amon, McLaren too.We're less sure about Miles.We like Richie Ginter,Masten Gregory, Bob Bondurant?You want the best driver for the car,who understands the machine, that's Ken.Oh, Yes!More of that, please.More of that, my girl.I may not get the finer points of racingMr. Shelby, but I do know people.Miles is...He's a beatnik.He dresses like one.Ford means reliability.Ken Miles is not a Ford man.Whoa!Giddyup, giddyup!What's the lap record here, Burt?..., dead.A beatnik? That man landed a bustedtank on the beach at DDayand drove it cleanacross Europe to Berlin.A beatnik?You know, Lee here asked me a while back,what's the one thing money can't buy.I'll tell you what it is.A pure racer behindthe wheel of your car.That's Ken Miles.Well, be that as it may,we think he may be too pure.Carroll, do not lose sightof the big picture here.Too pure?What exactly does that mean?Means he's all about himself.ABC puts a microphone under his nose.Perhaps there's a detail he dislikes.Millions watching.Do you trust him not to put outthe wrong message?Well look, you could get a cleancut all American poster boy.And stick him behind the wheel.Teach him what to say.Shit, you get Doris Day to drive the carif all you wanna do is lose.So, you don't agree with uson this issue?I'm saying you're gotta trust meon this one.Carroll, with marketing concerns,that's just not possible.Put a Ford type driverin a Ford car, Mr. Shelby.That's the Ford way.Yet another championship win for Ferrari...Ferrari wins.Wedges, we have wedges.Good, good, good.Perfect. ? Yup.Hey, boss.You got a passport? What's that? Sign that, Get a passport.Get it back to me by Friday.Frosty.Boys, I'm going to France.Phil.Ken, can I get a word?Can I take this?Do you know why Ford named it the GT?Why they put that  on there? No. Regulations.We gotta be  inches highto make the ground clearance requirements.No more, no less.They measure it before every race.Problem is that with that heightthere's too much drag under the car.So...We have a solution, Wedges.We put wedges in...You're not coming next week.You're not coming, Ken.We're taking McLaren,Chris Amon, Phil Hilland Bob Bondurant.This is Ford's call.It is their opinion thatyou are not a good image,so you cannot drive their race car.Putting aside the fact that you madethat car whatever the hell it is,and you're the best man I gotbehind the wheel.I'm gonna reroute the oil line.If there's spillage it could driponto the rear near side disc.Ken.Tell the boys to watchtheir pace come sunrise.The gearbox will overheat.Ken, race is starting soon.Want it on the radio?Not unless you do.There they are the Maseratigoing into the esses,but it's still the # cardriven by Chris Amon.In third place is the # Forddriven by Bruce McLaren.A tremendously fast start for the Ford GT.:. lap for car # Ford.I think it's a little bit quickfor this stage of the game.Racing too hot?Another Ford has come in to the pitit is being pushed intothe pit by the mechanic.Head gasket.The car's not a moon rocket.Leading # Ferrari of Michael Fahr.So, we have Fords running one,two, three, how about that?Too soon, surely too soon.Here's the big story,the lead Ford driven byRickie Getzer retires withgearbox trouble and the new leader...Gearbox.I told them to be gentle with it.Who's there?What's that you're listening to?Some race over in France.Excited?Not really paying much attention.It's not exactly Champagne.But it's got bubbles.Thanks, Mollie.Grace?Yes, sir?I will send him right in.Thank you.Mr. Shelby, Mr. Ford will see you now.Alright.This guy...This way, Mr. Shelby.Mr. Ford, gentlemen.Shelby.Give me one reason whyI don't fire everyoneassociated with thisabomination, starting with you.Well, sir.I was thinking about that very questionas I sat out there inyour lovely waiting room.As I was sitting there, I watched that little red folderright there gothrough four pairs of handsbefore it got to you.Of course, that don't includethe  or so other Ford employeeswho probably poked at it before itmade its way up to the th floor.With all due respect, sir,you can't win a race by committee.You need one man in charge.Now, the good news, as I see it,is that even with all the extra weightwe still managed to put ol' Mr. Ferrariexactly where we want him. Did we? Oh, yes.Expand.Well,sure, we haven't...We haven't worked outhow to corner yet.Or stay cool,or stay on the ground.And a lot of stuff broke.In fact, the only thing that didn't breakwas the brakes.Hell, right now, we don't even knowif our paint job willlast the whole  hours.But our last lap, we clocked  mphdown the Mulsanne straight.Now, in all his years of racing,ol' Enzo ain't never seenanything move that fast.And now he knows without a doubt,we're faster than he is.Even with the wrong driverand all the committees.And that's what he's thinking aboutwhile he's sitting inModena, Italy right now.That man is scared to deaththat this year you actuallymight be smart enough to start trusting me.So, yeah.I'd say you got Ferrariexactly where you want him.You're welcome.Come here.You see that little building down there?In World War II, three out of fiveUS bombers rolled off that line.You think Roosevelt beat Hitler?Think again.This isn't the first timeFord Motor's gone to war in Europe.We know how to do morethan push paper.And there is one manrunning this company.You report to him.You understand me?Yes, sir.Go ahead, Carroll. Go to war.Thank you, sir.You were right.It's the gearbox.We ran too hot.Three out of four of 'em broke.Rod blew on other one.We're goin' back, Ken.They told me I hada carte blanche this time.I looked it up,it's French for 'horse shit'.I know they gonna squeezeour nuts any way they canas soon as they work out how.Well, the ice cream's melting.Alright. Hey, Ken.You want me to apologize?You want me to beg?I don't know, let's try it out.Let's see how that feels.Ken, I'm sorry, sincerely.Do you have any ideathe kind of shitthat I had to eat just toget  wheels on that grid?No, you don't, 'cause you don't dealwith any of that stuff.Now, knock it off, Ken!We got work to do,and this car ain't gonna build itself.Okay, alright.Come here!Bloody car salesman.Shit!Come on. Now you'regonna get this.Get off me!Stubborn son of a bitch!Come here!Done.Mollie, darling.Yes, love?Could you get me a fizzy pop, please?Yes, love. Do you want one too, Shelby? No. Yes, please, Mollie. No, Mollie. No.He can get his own. Just for me, please.How long's that been?It's gotta bethree or four years at least. Riverside. Yeah, the SCCA Divisional Championship.You broke my finger.What was that? That?Nippy...Nippy bloody thing?You did on the arm that thing.Yeah, I call that 'The Llama bite.'You named it.Where'd you learn that?From the girl scouts?You wanna go again?Here you go. You're an angel. Thank you.My pleasure.Right. Well,I'm about to go to the grocery store.Anything you think you'll need?Ice cream, Ice cream would be good.And...bread. Right. No, I'm good. Thank you.Thanks, Mol.Still take those for you ticker?Only because they're so delicious.Up yours.Ah, go to hell.Giddyup, giddyup!Giddyup, giddyup!Sam.One for you mate.Dino, come here.Well?There's still a lag when I hit the gas.Let's get rid of the vacuum secondaries.Charlie, get a Holley carbwe're gonna rebuild the throttle assembly.Three weeks to Daytonaand it still feels like a bag of squirrels.Brake heat.That's a whole different ball game.All right, Petey.Let's go for that ride.What're you doing?See that crack?That's my marker for turn .What, to slow down?Ah, brush the brakes and downshift.But you'll be going a  mph.Yeah.So how do you see it?You go fast, but as the car speeds upeverything else slows down.You don't do that.You do this, right?And then you see everything.Do you set other markers?Indeed I do. Lots of them.Yeah, 'cause you can't just pushthe car hard the whole way, right?That's right.You have to be kind to the car. You feelthe poor thing groaning underneath you.If you're gonna push a pieceof machinery to the limitand expect it to hold together,you have to have some senseof where that limit is.Look out there.Out there is the perfect lap.No mistakes.Every gear change, every corner.Perfect.You see it?I think so.Most people can't.Most people don't even knowit's out there but it is.It's there.You want some ice cream? Yeah. Alright.Come on then. You know what this marker is? What?That one.Pull my finger. You'll find out.How much longerbefore he comes in?Well, we change drivers every  hours,so about  minutes.No, hang on,You're saying Beebe isa % in charge now?Yes, and he wants Miles gone.Look, it is personal with this guy.Yes, he has the leverageis to stick with you.He and the Deuce are flying there tomorrow.He's gonna tell you in person.All he is hoping foris that you lose your cool.It's time to let this go.You cannot destroythe whole thing,not for one goddamn guy. Sure I can. But why?'Cause while we're here talking,he's out there getting it done.Oh, shit!He's got brake fade.Ease off! Get him out! Peter! Just go inside.Just stay there! Ken! Get him out! Hurry! Ken! Ken! Come on.The brakes.Let's just rip out the damnengine, alright.We can't use itif we can't stop.The brakes would last longerif you slowed down a bit.Wouldn't that defeat the whole purposeof the extra power?Y'know, I thought the whole point wasto win the damned race.Maybe we could designa new assembly.Instead of swapping outthe pads in the pits,swap out the entirebraking system, rotors included.Put in a fresh one.Wait, wait. Pops.We're allowed to do that?I don't know. I don't read French.Brakes are a part like any other, right? We are allowed to change parts. Yes.Will we have time to do that?I don't know yet, Charlie. I'm gonna take him home. Alright. Sort this shit out. I will.Have you ever been on fire?Well, no, no. It's never happened to me.The suit's flameproof, see.Keeps heat out.Yeah.But Lewis Evans burnt to deathin the Moroccan Grand Prix.He had a flameproof suit on.Yeah, but...See, he got stuck.He couldn't breathe.So as long as you get outof the car, you're okay.Dad got out. He sure did. Peter. Bye. See ya. You all right? Yeah.What's wrong with you?Don't tell me brakes or me almostkicking the bucket out there.It's something to dowith the suits, isn't it?It's under control.What is it?You know how we talked aboutyou do your thing, I do my thing.This is my thing. Shel. Just trust me, Ken.You got a plan?Absolutely.A good one?It's high risk. How high risk? Extremely high risk.Well, that's something. Glad we had this talk. Anytime.Mr. Ford, this is a surprise.Apologies for theunannounced intrusion, Mr. Shelby.A man pays  million dollarsfor an automobilehe ought to at least be able to see it.That sounds reasonable enough. Shelby, can I have a word? Sure.In private? Ah, yeah, that would be preferable. Alright.Hey Phil, you wanna take care of Mr. Fordhere? Mr. Ford, that's Phil Remington. Of course. Come to my office, Leo.Pleasure, sir.Let me give a little tour of your car.We took out your  small blockand put in a . liter.Firstly, I wanna just clear the air.I hope that whatever disagreementsbetween us can just be chalked up tonatural redbloodednessin the heat of battle.I appreciate that Leo.

I had no idea.Now you wanna win Le Mans.You really wanna take st place,Ken Miles is the man to do it.Good timing.He knows this carbecause he helped me build it.Shelby, you know I've already appointedLeo Beebe Director of...Which is exactlywhy I'm talking to you.You let Ken Miles race Daytona.If he wins,he gets to drive Le Mans.And if he doesn't?Ford Motor Company gets full ownershipof Shelby American.Lock, stock and brand.

He's certainly the leader of this group.Good for you.Good for you, Ken.Look at that!Well done, Leo.You too, John.Explain to me how he's finished firstif he's not won the race?Because McLaren started from further,so he came into and he won.It's not a tie!Because McLaren started furtherback, they're saying.He's traveled a little bit further.So, he's won and not Ken.That's bullshit!Shel, hold on!Where is the tie?Where is the goddamn tie?What?You son of a bitch! You knew! I didn't, I swear.Enough!Nice race, mate. Congrats.Shel!They robbed you, Ken.Here's the clarification, though thedrivers finished the race in a heat,McLaren has been ruled the winneras he started from farther back.Some bullshit technicality.I never should've asked you.Selling cars, huh?That's what they do.Well,you promised me the drive,not the win.It was a hell of a drive.She's a hell of a machine.She's fast.Could be faster.The  liter's sweet.We still need a lighter chassis.I was thinking bonded aluminum.It's a ground up rebuild, but if it workswe can lose a couple of hundred pounds.What the hell are we doing here?Let me take a shower,get a cup of tea.Ham and cheese cob or something.We gonna get the bastards next year.Got a bit of fuel left in the tank.What do you think of those honeycombpanels. What you were looking for?I don't know yet.She looks pretty good.There's a point at  RPMwhere everything fades.The machine becomesweightless, Just disappears.And all that's left is a bodymoving through space and time. RPM, that's where you need it.You feel it coming.It creeps up on you, close in your ear,and asks you a question.The only question that matters.Get the van!""Who are you?""What do you think?It's fantastic! That was really good.Nice and smooth.No vibration in the box.It was really strong.You drove her for less than an hour,you can't tell shit after an hour.Hey, Shel.Hey, Shell. That guy, the one in the hat.He's ready to close on those two 's.His and hers, full freight.They flew in from Galveston.I need you to come outsidefor maybe a minute.And do what?Be Carroll Shelby.Tell them a story.Spin a few magic words.What does that mean?Magic words?It means, comeoutside, and say hello,and make them feel goodabout their purchase.They're getting the damn cars.That's what they get for their money, Phil.Either they want them or they don't.Am I some kind of a lounge act?! No. Am I here to talk people into things?!It's been  months, Shel.Six months.Sometimes, they don't getout of the car.Peter!Peter, come and takethe garbage out!Mr. Shelby?Hello, Pete.I remember that wrench.My Dad threw it at you.I believe he did.Why?Oh.I think I probablysaid something to him.Called him a few names.That's right.Do you wanna speak to my Mum?Well, I did. I came to say hello,check in on her andthen, I started thinking sometimesthat words just are not useful.Tools are useful 'cause youcan make stuff with 'em,and you can fix stuff with 'em.Here.Thanks.Your Daddy was a...He was your friend.Yes, he was.Yes, sir.And he thought you wasjust finer than frog fur.Peter!I think I've gotta go help my Mum.What are you doinghere then?
