"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN  A Screenplay  Adapted  from an Annie Proulx  Story  By  Larry  McMurtry and Diana Ossana  February  1, 2003  l  2  3  EXT: HIGHWAY: NIGHT (NEAR DAWN): ;.963:  A cattle  truck,  running  empty,  tops  a ridge  on a lonely  western  highway.  To the east,  the first  faint  flush  of light.  Across  the plain,  perhaps  yet some twenty  miles  away, a  sprinkle  of lights  like  fallen  stars  on the vast  dark plain.  The truck  roars  on.  INT: TRUCK CAB: NIGHT: CONTINUOUS:  It is lighter  now, but the light  is high,  and the olain  still  mainly  dark,  the lights  of Signal,  Wyoming vivid,  closer  now,  perhaps  five  miles  ahead.  Patsy  Cline's  ""WALKIN' AFTER MI~NIGHT"" on the radio.  The  TRUCKER, inscrutable,  barrels  on.  Cabin is hazv with  cigarette  smoke.  ·  In profile,  WE SEE the passenger  take  an old mashed-up  Stetson  off the dashboard.  This is ENNIS DEL MAR: not yet twenty,  but nonetheless  compelling,  not light  or frivolous  in disposition,  appearance  or manner,  uncommonly quick reflexes--a  high-school  drop-out  country  boy with no prospects,  brought  up to hard work and  privation,  rough-mannered,  rough-spoken,  inured  to the  stoic  life.  Has outgrown  his faded denirr. cowboy shirt,  his  wrists  stick  well out of the sleeves,  the buttons  gap.  ENNIS  (straightens  the creases  of the  hat,  sets  it on his head)  That's  Signal,  ain't  it?  TRUCKER  (no conversationalist)  Was the last  time I come this  way.  ENNIS looks straight  ahead at the lights.  EXT: MAIN STREET: SIGNAL, WYOMING: DAY (LATER):  Lighter  st il L  The truck  stops  with a screech  of air  brakes  in front  of a  service  station  just  opening  for the day.  An OLD MAN is  rolling  a tractor  tire  as big as he is into  the garage.  ENNIS steps  out of the truck,  no suitcase,  just  a grocery  sack stuffed  with his only other  shirt  and pair  of Levi's.  ( CONTI!IUED)  l  ,,  3  3  2.  CONTINUED:  The truck  moves again,  almost  before  he hits  the ground,  spraying  him with dust.  Tall,  raw-boned,  lanky,  possessed  of a muscular,  supple  body  made for the horse  and for fighting--he  stretches,  looks  at  the OLD MAN, who looks  back at him sourly.  One of ENNIS'S  boot heels  is worn, has to adjust  for the turn  of the heel  as  he walks.  No one in sight  on the streets  of Signal.  After  a moment, carrying  his sack,  ENNIS walks over to the  OLD MAN, who is balancing  the tractor  tire  against  a pillar.  ENNIS  'Scuse  me.  Mightin'  you tell  me where  the Farm and Ranch Employment Office  is  at?  OLD Kl\.N  (not as sour as he looks,  points)  In that  there  trailer  house.  Three  blocks  down.  You'll  see it.  ENNIS nods,  tips  his hat,  starts  off.  OLD MAN  Don't  let  that  goddamn Joe Aguirre  send  you up to Brokeback without  no thirty- ought.  There's  coyotes  and coyotes  up  there,  they'll  eat your damn sheep  and  your damn jackass,  too.  With a thirty- ought,  you might hold your own.  ENNIS, surprised  by this  torrent  of words,  clears  his  throat.  ENNIS  Sir?  The OLD MAN kicks  at the tractor  tire  a time or two,  as if  irritated  it exists.  Looks at ENNIS.  OLD ~WJ  Where was you raised,  bud?  ENNIS  Uh, Sage.  OLD MAN  Why, that  ain't  hardly  in Wyoming, that's  nearly  to Utah.  You ain't  a damn Mormon,  are you?  (CONTINUED)  3  •  3  4  •  •  5  CONTINUED: ( 2 )  ENNIS  No, sir.  I just  never heard a no place  called  Brokeback.  3 •  The OLD MAN points  to a long,  barren  mountain  to the no~th,  its  upper reaches  miles  away, reaching  well above the tree  line.  OLD MAN  Don't  vou let  that  damn Joe Aguirre  send  you up.there  with no twenty-two.  Coyotes  don't  mind a twenty-two.  Make sure he  gives  you a thirty-ought.  Too much talk  for ENNIS, who nods his thanks.  Looks up at the mountain  as he walks off.  EXT: SIGNAL, WYOMING: TRAILER: DAY:  The sun is full  up, though  it is still  early.  A gentle  breeze  whistles.  ENNIS sits  on the steps  of a dingy trailer  house,  a crooked  sign above the door says FARM AND RANCH EMPLOYMENT  AGENCY.  Smokes, waits.  Sees an old green pickup with a bad muffler  approaching,  and ENNIS becomes aware that  the muffler  is not  the pickup's  only problem.  It coughs,  sputters,  rattles  from  several  junctures  as it pulls  into  the gravel  parking  lot  of  the AGENCY and dies.  The driver  sits  a moment in the driver's  seat,  then  gets  out  and slams the door of the pickup  in disgust,  looks  at it much  as the OLD MAN had looked at the tractor  tire.  This is JACK TWIST: like  ENNIS, a rough country  boy with  little  education,  but somewhat different  in appearance  and  attitude,  a little  less  stoic,  a little  more of a dreamer.  More welcoming,  appealing,  with a quick  laugh.  Nineteen,  not  as tall  as ENNIS, more compact and muscular,  thick,  dark  hair,  worn jeans,  bullrider's  belt  buckle,  faded shirt,  stubbly  beard,  straw cowboy hat,  boots worn to the quick.  Doesn't  notice  EtrnIS--the  steps  of the trailer  house  are  still  in shade.  But when he does,  he stiffens  a little-- looks  at hirn--looks  away.  Then the two ignore  one another  completely .  EXT: SIGNAL, WYOMING:  TRAILER: DAY (L.l,TER):  Eight  a.m.  The wind has picked  up considerably.  (CONTINUED)  3  4  •  5  I  ••  5  •  6  •  ' ..  CONTI!IDED:  JACK attempts  to shave using  his  rearview  mirror,  a 25-cent  razor  and water  in a paper  cup.  Painful  work,  but keeps at  it,  scraping  away at his  stubble.  Pickup  radio  plays  Johnny  Cash's  ""I WALK THE LINE"".  An old white  Buick stationwagon  races  along  a street  congested  with pickups  pulling  horse  trailers.  The  stationwagon  whips into  the parking  lot,  throwing  dust  over  JACK, who hastily  concludes  his  shaving  operation.  The  stationwagon  stops  about two feet  from the steps  of the  trailer  office,  as ENNIS jumps up to get out of the way.  The driver,  JOE AGUIRRE, middle-aged,  stocky,  no fool,  hair  the color  of cigarette  ash and parted  down the middle,  foam  dice  hanging  from the rearview,  gets  out.  Then reaches  back  in for an oversize  container  of coffee.  JOE glares  at ENNIS, then JACK, as he heads  for  the trailer  office  door.  Neither  boy moves.  JOE goes inside.  in his pockets.  Door slams.  ENNIS sticks  his  big raw hands  JACK considers  checking  under  his  hood.  JOE AGUIRRE  (sticks  his head out the door)  If you pair  a deuces  are lookin'  for  work, I suggest  you get your asses  in  here,  pronto.  ENNIS picks  up his grocery  sack of clothes.  Looks over at  JACK.  Heads inside.  JACK follows.  The door forcefully  slams behind  them.  INT: TRAILER OFFICE: DAY: CONTINUOUS:  Dusty,  choky little  trailer  office.  Venetian  blinds  hang  askew,  the one desk littered  with papers,  the Bakelite  ashtray  filled  with butts,  only one chair  for guests.  A pair  of binoculars  hangs from a nail  in the wall  behind  AGUIRRE'S  desk.  Neither  ENNIS nor JACK sits.  ENNIS smokes.  In the background,  a small,  old black-and-white  TV plays  a  news story  about then-President  Kennedy .  JOE AGUIRRE, in his swivel  chair,  gives  them his  point  of  view.  (CONTINUED)  5  6  •  6  •  •  5 •  CONTINUED:  JOE AGUIRRE  Forest  service  got designated  campsites  on the allotments.  Them camps can be 3,  4 miles  from where we pasture  the  woollies.  Bad predator  loss  if there's  nobody lookin'  after  'em at night.  (drags  on a cigarette)  What I want  ( looks at Ennis)  is a camp tender  in the main camp where  the Forest  Service  says,  but the  herder ..•  (points  at Jack)  ••• pitch  a pup tent  on the Q.T. with the  sheep,  and he's  goin a sleep  there.  Eat  supper,  breakfast  in camp, but sleep  with  the sheep,  hundred percent,  no fire,  don't  leave  no sign.  Roll up that  tent  every mornin'  case Forest  Service  snoops  around.  ENNIS is balancing  a long ash on his cigarette·,·  considers  the  ashtray  which is overflowing  onto JOE'S paperwork,  finally  just  taps  it into  his hand.  Phone rings.  JOE picks  it up. Listens.  Frowns.  JOE AGUIRRE  (cont'd)  No.  No.  Not on your fuckin'  life.  (hangs up, resumes)  Got the dogs, your 30/30,  sleep  there.  Last summer had goddamn near  25% loss.  Don't want that  again.  You ..•  (points  at Ennis--takes  him in)  ... Fridays  noon be down at the bridge  with your grocery  list  and mules.  Somebody with supplies  will  be there  in a  pickup.  JOE stubs  his cigarette  in the over-full  ashtray,  grabs  a  cheap round watch on a braided  cord from a box on a high  shelf,  winds it,  sets  it,  while JACK and ENNIS look on.  Tosses  it to ENNIS as if he's  not worth the reach.  JOE AGUIRRE  (cont'd)  Tomorrow mornin'  we'll  truck  you up to  the jump-off.  Picks  up the phone. Pauses.  Looks at them hard.  Awkward:  they realize  they are dismissed.  (CONTINUED)  6  I  ••  6  7  •  8  •  6.  CONTINUED: ( 2 )  Leave.  Emns  has to stoop  to get out  the door.  EXT: SIGN.1'.L, WYOMING: TRAILER: DAY: CONTINUOGS:  The door to the  trailer  slams  shut  behind  them.  JACK walks  down the three  steps  outside  the  trailer.  ENNIS stops,  stands  on the  lowest  step  of the  trailer,  looks  around  at the  bleak  surroundings.  JACK smiles,  sticks  out his  hand.  A beat.  JACK  Jack Twist.  ENNIS  (shakes  hands)  Ennis.  JACK  Your folks  just  stop  at Ennis?  ENNIS  (after  a moment)  Del Mar.  JACK  Nice to know you,  Ennis  Del Mar.  Since  we' re gonna be working  together,  I recl:on  it's  time we start  drinkin'  together.  ENNIS looks  at the watch AGUIRRE gave him:  WE SEE it's  eight  thirty.  E1;1;rs nods to JACK.  IN'I: BAR: MORNING:  The barroon  is large  and cavernous.  All the chairs  are  stacked  upside-down  on the tables.  It's  empty except  for  a  EA!<TENDER  and WAITRESS, both middle-aged.  The husky Bi'.RTENDER stands  behind  the bar and stocks  bottled  beer  into  the cooler.  The skinny,  middle-aged  WAITRESS  cleans  ashtrays  in a sink.  ENNIS and JACK enter  the dingy  bar.  Sunlight  bursts  into  the  dimly  lit  room, startling  the  Bi'.RTENDER and the WAITRESS .  ENNIS and JACK wait  a moment for their  eyes to adjust  to the  darkness.

The WAITRESS glares  at the BARTENDER.  WAITRESS  Aw, lay off  'em, Royce.  They're  just  buttons.  ROYCE shrugs.  Wl'.ITRESS  (cont'd--friendly,  too)  You boys have a seat.  't .  JACK and ENNIS take  their  seats  at the bar.  ENNIS lights  up  a smoke.  The WAITRESS finishes  drying  an ashtray  on her apron.  Places  it  in front  of ENNIS.  WAITRESS  Now then,  what'll  you have?  JACK  Bud, please.  ENNIS  Bud.  INT: BAR: DAY (LATER):  El\1'1IS and JACK still  sit  at the bar,  each nurses  a long neck.  ENNIS peels  the label  from his bottle.  A few empties  sit  in  front  of JACK.  JACK  My second year up here.  Last year one  storm the lightnin'  kilt  42 sheep.

JACK  You drink  up.  I'll  worry  'bout  the  tab.  JACK and ENNIS chug their  beers,  slam the bottles  on the  bar.  Wl,ITRESS returns  with  two opened  beers.  WAITRESS  That's  more like  it.  WAITRESS gives  each boy his  fresh  beer.  Gathers  the  empties,  and leaves.  ENNIS  What was you say in'  'bout  lightnin  ·?  JACK  It  smoked some sheep.  Aguirre  got all  over my ass like  I was supposed  to  control  the weather.  (drinks)  Beats  workin'  for my old man. can't  please  my old man, no way.  That's  why I  took to rodeoin'  .

INT: PICKUP TRUCK: MORNING:  ~E SEE them pull  out of Signal  in an Agency pickup  driven  by  a short,  silent  BASQUE. ENNIS looks  hungover,  holds  his  head.  JACK, though,  is sharp  and alert.  They pass  the gas station.  ENNIS glimpses  the same sour  old  rr.an, sitting  on the tractor  tire.  BASQUE  You boys need to stick  close  sheep.

WE LINGER on this  trek  for a bit,  as the  sheep  spread  out  onto  the expansive  treeless  plain,  nothing  in sight  but sky  and land,  high clouds.

The mountain,  misted,  is the color  of smoke, the high,  grassy  plain  invisible.  ENNIS cleans  the breakfast  plates  by the fire.  JACK mounts his bay mare.  She crow-hops  a little;  he keeps  her under control.  Rides off,  ENNIS watching  him go.  EXT: BROKEBACK  MOUNTAIN: DAY: MONTAGE:  A.

Cigar  Butt  races  off  the trail,  pulling  the two mules  along  with  him through  the  trees  and the  undergrowth,  tearing  the  supply  packs,  scattering  food everywhere.
