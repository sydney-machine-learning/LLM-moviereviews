Gets tiresome.What do you do, Ennis Del Mar?Well, earlier today,I was castrating calves.What are you doing?Trying to geta foot rub, dummy.All right.That good?And then I pledgedTri Delt at SMU.And I sure never thought...I'd end up in a pokylittle place like Childress.Then I met old Randall hereat an Aggie game...and he was an animalhusbandry major.So we've been here for a monthand he got the foreman job...over at Roy Taylor's ranch.Like it or not, here I am!Was you Tri Delt?I was Kappa Phi myself.Well, even though we ain'tquite sorority sisters...we just may have to dancewith ourselves, Lureen.Our husbands ain't the leastbit interested in dancin'.They ain't got a smidgenof rhythm between them.It's funny, isn't it?Husbands don't never seem towanna dance with their wives.Why do you think that is, Jack?I don't know,I never give it any thought.Wanna dance? Yes, thank you. Do you mind?No, it's all right. Go ahead.All right.Pardon us.Thank you for asking meto dance with you.I really appreciate that.Randall never does.Last time I did,I think it was our wedding.It's a good thing you and Lureenhappened along when you did...or else we'd still be stuckon the side of the road...in that darn pickup.I told Randallwe ought to take the car.Of course,he'd never listen to me.He wouldn't listen to meif he was goin' deaf tomorrow.I told him it'd take more thanchewing gum and baling wire...to fix that pickup.Well, he's never beenvery mechanical, though.Come over here and ask...You ever notice how a womanwill powder her nose...before she goes to a party?And then she'll powder itagain once the party's over.I mean, why powder your nosejust to go home and go to bed?Don't know.Even if I wanted to know...I couldn't get a word in withLashawn long enough to ask.Woman talks a blue streak.Lively little gal.You'll like workingfor Roy Taylor. He's solid, Roy. Yeah, Roy. He's a good old boy.He's got a little cabindown on Lake Kemp.Got a crappie house,little boat.Said I could use itwhenever I want.We ought to go down theresome weekend.Drink a little whiskey,fish some.Get away, you know?That was right out of SMU.I could've had my pick of prettymuch any job in North Dallas.So my pick was Neiman Marcus,which was a disaster...because, honey, where clothes isconcerned, I got no resistance.I was spending more than I made.More than Randall ever will make.We come out here...thinkin' that ranchin' wasstill big hats and Marlboros.Boy, were we behind the times.Hey there, Junior. You ready?What do you think?Your daddy ever gonna seefit to settle down again?Don't know. Maybe he's notthe marrying kind.You don't think so?Or you don't thinkI'm the one for him?You're good enough.You don't say much,but you get your point across.Sorry.I didn't mean to be rude.All right.You're stayin'on your feet, cowboy.Excuse me, darling.So I'll pick you and Jenny upnext weekend, after church.Fine.You all right?Yes.Are you sure?Daddy, I was thinking, whatwith the new baby and all...Ma and Monroe have beenawful strict on me.More on me than Jenny even.I was thinkin',maybe I could...Maybe I could comestay with you.I'd be an awful good help,I know I would.Now, you knowI ain't set up for that.With the roundup comin'...I won't ever be home.It's all right, Daddy.I'm not sayin' that I wouldn't...It's all right, I understand.Well, see you on Sunday, then.Bye.Bye, sweetheart.Going to snow tonight for sure.Yup.All this time and you ain'tfound nobody else to marry?I been puttin' the blocks...to a goodlookin' little galover in Riverton.She's a waitress. Wants to goto nursing school or somethin'.I don't know.What about you and Lureen?Lureen's good at making hard dealsin the machinery business...but as far asour marriage goes...we could do it over the phone.I kind of got this thinggoing with...a ranch foreman's wifeover in Rutters. What? I'm bound to get shot...by Lureen or her husband eachtime I slip off to see her.You probably deserve it.Tell you what.The truth is...sometimes I miss you so much,I can hardly stand it.I guess I'll head upon to Lightning Flat.See the folks for a day or two.There's somethin' I beenmeanin' to tell you, bud.Well, it's likely November beforeI can come out here again.After we ship stock and beforewinter feedin' starts again.November.What in the hell ever happenedto August?Well...Christ, Ennis.You know, you had a fucking week tosay some little word about this.Why is it we're alwaysin the friggin' cold?We ought to go southwhere it's warm, you know!We ought to go to Mexico.Mexico?Hell, Jack, you know me. Aboutall the travelin' I ever done...is around a coffee pot,looking for the handle.Come on, Jack.Lighten up on me.We can hunt in November.Kill us a nice elk.I'll try if I can getDon Wroe's cabin again.We had a good time that year,didn't we?There's never enough time,never enough.You know, friend...this is a goddamn bitch ofan unsatisfactory situation.You used to come away easy.Now it's like seein' the Pope.Jack, I got to work.In them earlier days,I'd just quit the job.You...You forget what it's likebein' broke all the time.You ever hear of child support?I'll tell you this,I can't quit this one...and I can't get the time off.It was hard enoughgettin' this time.The tradeoff was August.Well, you got a better idea?I did, once.You did, once.Well, have you been to Mexico,Jack Twist?'Cause I hear what they gotin Mexico for boys like you.Hell, yes, I've been to Mexico.Is that a fucking problem?I'm going to tell you thisone time, Jack fucking Twist.And I ain't foolin'.What I don't know, all themthings that I don't know...could get you killedif I come to know them.I ain't jokin'.Yeah, well try this one,and I'll say it just once. Go ahead! I'll tell you what.We could have hada good life together.Fucking real good life.Had us a place of our own!But you didn't want it, Ennis.So what we got nowis Brokeback Mountain!Everything's built on that! That'sall we got, boy. Fucking all.So I hope you know that, if youdon't never know the rest!You count the damn few times...that we have been togetherin nearly  years...and you measure the shortfucking leash you keep me on...and then you ask me about Mexicoand you tell me you'll kill me...for needin' somethin'I don't hardly never get!You have no ideahow bad it gets!And I'm not you!I can't make it...on a couple of highaltitudefucks once or twice a year!You are too much for me, Ennis.You son of a whoreson bitch!I wish I knew how to quit you!Then why don't you?Why don't you justlet me be, huh?It's because of you, Jack,that I'm like this.I'm nothin'.I'm nowhere. It's okay. Get the fuck off me!It's all right. It's all right.Damn you, Ennis.I just can't standthis any more, Jack.Come on now, you're sleepin'on your feet like a horse.My mama used to say that to mewhen I was little.And sing to me.I got to go.See you in the morning.Excuse me.Hey.Ennis Del Mar.Where you been?Here and there.I left word for youwith Steve at the ranch.And you must've got thosenotes I left at your place.Looks like I got the message,in any case.Carl?Yeah, Carl's nice.He even talks.Good for you.Yeah.Good for me.I don't get you, Ennis Del Mar.I'm sorry.I was probablyno fun anyways, was I?Ennis, girls don'tfall in love with fun.Hello.Hello, this is Ennis Del Mar.Who? Who is this?Ennis Del Mar.I'm an old buddy of Jack's.Jack used to mention you.You're the fishing buddy or thehunting buddy, I know that.Would have let you knowwhat happened...but I wasn't sureabout your name or address.Jack kept his friends'addresses in his head.That's why I'm callin',to see what happened.Oh, yeah.Jack was pumpin' up a flaton the truck...out on a back road,when the tire blew up.The rim of the tire slammedinto his face...broke his nose and jaw and knockedhim unconscious on his back.By the time somebody come along,he'd drowned in his own blood.He was only  years old.Hello? Hello?Hello.Was he buried down there?We put a stone up.He was cremated,like he wanted.Half his ashes was interred here, therest was sent up with his folks.He use to say he wanted his ashesscattered on Brokeback Mountain...but I wasn't surewhere that was.I thought Brokeback Mountain mightbe around where he grew up.Knowing Jack...it might be somepretend place...where bluebirds singand there's a whiskey spring.No, ma'am...we was herdin' sheepon Brokeback one summer...back in '.Well, he saidit was his favorite place.I thought he meant toget drunk. He drank a lot.Is his folks still upin Lightning Flat?They'll be theretill the day they die.Thank you for your time.I sure am sorry.We was good friends.Get in touch with his folks.I suppose they'd appreciate itif his wishes was carried out.About the ashes, I mean.Want a cup of coffee, don't you?Piece of cherry cake?Yes, ma'am,I'll have a cup of coffee...but I can't eat no cakejust now. Thank you.I feel awful bad about Jack.Thank you.I can't begin to tell youhow bad I feel.I knew him a long time.I come by to say that...if you want me to take hisashes up there on Brokeback...like his wife saidhe wanted to...then I'll be happy to.I'll tell you what.I know whereBrokeback Mountain is.Thought he was too goddamn specialto be buried in the family plot.Jack used to say...""Ennis Del Mar,""he used to say.""I'm gonna bring him up hereone of these days...""""and we'll lick thisdamn ranch into shape.""He had somehalfbaked notion...the two of you was gonnamove up here...build a cabin...help run the place.Then, this spring...he got another fellagonna come up here with him...build the place,help run the ranch.Some ranch neighbor of hisfrom down in Texas.Gonna split up with his wifeand come back here...so he says.But, like most ofJack's ideas...never come to pass.I kept his roomlike it was when he was a boy.I think he appreciated that.You are welcome to go upto his room, if you want.Yeah, I'd like that. Thank you.Tell you what.We got a family plot.He's goin' in it.Yes, sir.You come back and see us again.Thank you, ma'am. Hey there, Junior. Hey, Daddy.Come here.Like the car? Yeah. Is it yours?
