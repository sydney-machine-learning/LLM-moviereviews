THE SOUND OF DRUMS, from a great distance, growing louder. FADE IN: WE ARE FLYING through mist, a dimly glimpsed forest below. VOICE (V.O.) When I was lying there in the VA hospital, with a big hole blown through the middle of my life, I started having these dreams of flying. We are very low over the forest now, gliding fast, the drums BUILDING to a PEAK VOICE (V.O.) Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up... CUT TO: EXT. CITY NIGHT A SCREECH OF BRAKES as a vehicle WIPES FRAME, revealing JAKE SULLY, a scarred and scruffy combat vet, sitting in a beat up carbonfiber wheelchair. At , his eyes are hardened by the wisdom and wariness of one who has endured pain beyond his years. Jake stares upward at the levels of the city. MAGLEV TRAINS WHOOSH overhead on elevated tracks, against a sky of garish advertizing. JAKE (V.O.) They can fix a spinal, if youve got the money. But not on vet benefits, not in this economy. The traffic light changes and Jake pushes forward with the crowd, pumping the wheels of his chair. Most of the people wear FILTER MASKS to protect them from the toxic air. In a LONG LENS STACK it is a marching torrent of anonymous, isolated souls. INT. JAKES APARTMENT NIGHT The room is a tiny CUBICLE, prison cell meets bathroom. Narrow cot, wallscreen droning away in the B.G. PERKY NEWSCASTER The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a century, is making a comeback. These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are... Jake laboriously pulls his pants off rocking to one side, pushing the fabric down past his hip, then rocking to the other, and so on. His legs are white and atrophied. Utterly useless. But his arms are tattooed and powerfully muscled. A Born Loser tattoo prominent on his shoulder. JAKE (V.O.) I became a Marine for the hardship. To be hammered on the anvil of life. I told myself I could pass any test a man can pass. Jake struggles with his pants a long time. CUT TO: INT. ROWDY BAR NIGHT Not the kind of place youd bring your mom. We find Jake near the pool table, BALANCING his chair, front wheels off the ground, while holding a tequila shot on his forehead. ONLOOKERS, including some other disabled vets, CLAP and WHOOP. Jake grabs the glass, SLAMS down the shot as they cheer. A WALLSIZED SCREEN filled with the World Cup game men RUNNING on antelope legs. CU JAKE, watching what he cant have. Expression stony. JAKE (V.O.) Lets get it straight up front. I dont want your pity. I know the worlds a coldass bitch. Jakes eyes shift HIS POV, seeing the bar through gaps in the crowd. A MAN on a barstool SLAPS the WOMAN hes with. Hard. She cowers but hes got her arm, shouting, raising his fist. An eternal tableau. People look away. CU JAKE not looking away. JAKE (V.O.) You want a fair deal, youre on the wrong planet. The strong prey on the weak. TIGHT ON JAKES HAND as he starts pushing the wheel of his chair. TRACKING WITH HIM as he rolls forward. . JAKE (V.O.) Its just the way things are. And nobody does a damn thing. Jake stops, unnoticed, next to the bullying man. He leans down and grabs one leg of the mans barstool and YANKS. The chair flips. The guy goes down HARD and JAKE hurls himself from the wheelchair, toppling on the guy, getting a grip on him like a pit bull and PUNCHING the crap out of him, right there on the floor. THE BOUNCER jumps in, trying to drag him off and it goes into SLOW MOTION, everybody yelling and pulling... JAKE (V.O.) All I ever wanted in my sorryass life was a single thing worth fighting for. CUT TO: EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR NIGHT THE BOUNCER hurls Jake out the door, sending him SPRAWLING on the pavement. A moment later, his chair CRASHES down on him, banging across the alley, landing in the trash. Jake struggles to rise on one elbow. Hes bleeding and bruised, but still crazed and ready to fight. JAKE I hope you realize youve just lost a customer! He collapses onto his back, panting. JAKE (to himself) Candy ass bitch. He stares upwards at the levels of the city. MAGTRAINS ROAR overhead. It starts to RAIN. He just lies there, blinking then shouts jauntily to no one in particular JAKE If it aint rainin we aint trainin! CAMERA PULLS BACK high and wide, as Jake lies spreadeagled amongst the trash, getting drenched. TWO LONG SHADOWS enter FRAME, coming to rest across him. . Jake sees two pairs of SHINY SHOES stop next to him. He squints up at TWO MEN. Matching suits. Their features unremarkable and blandly threatening in the way of FBI agents and auditors. AGENT Are you Jake Sully? JAKE Step off. Youre ruinin my good mood. AGENT Its about your brother. CUT TO: INT. MUNICIPAL CREMATORIUM NIGHT DOWNANGLE on a large rectangular cardboard box. HANDS ENTER FRAME, pulling open the top to reveal a DEAD MANS FACE. He looks EXACTLY like a cleanshaven version of Jake. His IDENTICAL TWIN TOMMY. JAKE (V.O.) The strong prey on the weak. A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be, for the paper in his wallet. WIDER, showing Jake and the two agents in a high tech CREMATORIUM a row of stainless steel furnaces. Jake stares down at his own face. JAKE Jesus, Tommy. JAKE (V.O.) The Suits concern was touching. AGENT Your brother represented a significant investment. Wed like to talk to you about taking over his contract. The ATTENDANT closes the box and seals it with a tape dispenser, like its a package for shipping. The cardboard coffin is rolled into the furnace. JAKE (V.O.) The egghead and the jarhead. Tommy was the scientist, not me. He was the one who wanted to get shot light years out into space to find the answers. . PUSHING IN ON JAKE as he watches, bathed in orange light. JAKE (V.O.) Me I was just another dumb grunt gettin sent someplace I was gonna regret. INSIDE THE FURNACE the burners quickly eat away the cardboard; TOMMYS FACE is, for a moment, wreathed in flame but not touched by it, as we DISSOLVE TO: JAKES FACE, in icy darkness. CLOSE ON his eyes they OPEN suddenly, and he takes a sharp breath. JAKES POV the inside of a metal coffin. A SERVO WHINE and we are moving, emerging into a large chamber INT. CRYO VAULT JAKES POV A TECH in medical scrubs FLOATS WEIGHTLESSLY toward us. Wherever we are, were not on Earth. Jake squints as the lights flicker on, revealing WIDE SHOT the multitiered CRYO VAULT. Hundreds of CRYO CAPSULES are opening like morgue drawers, as med techs pull themselves about in ZEROG, tending to their patients. JAKE (a hoarse whisper) Are we there? MED TECH Were there, Sunshine. TIME CUT SCORES OF PEOPLE emerge from their cryocapsules in ZEROG. Pale spirits of the dead rising from rows of open coffins. The MED TECH floats among them, using his announcement voice. MED TECH People, you have been in cryo for five years, nine months and twenty two days. You will be hungry, you will be weak. If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience. The staff thanks you in advance. . FOLLOWING JAKE as he pushes away from his capsule, gliding to the LOCKERS across the aisle, his paralyzed legs not an impediment in weightlessness. CUT TO: EXT. SPACE Against the cold infinity of stars glides an INTERSTELLAR SPACECRAFT ISV VENTURE STAR. As it moves past like an endless train, we realize this thing is ENORMOUS over half a mile long. PAN WITH IT to REVEAL A GASGIANT PLANET called POLYPHEMUS, ringed with dozens of moons which cast beautymark shadows on its vast face. The ISV diminishes away from us toward the largest MOON a blue and surprisingly Earthlike world called PANDORA. The ship dwindles to a speck against the BLUE MOON. CUT TO: EXT. PANDORA ORBIT ISV Venture Star drifts above a spectacular vista the sapphire seas and unfamiliar continents of Pandora. CLOSE ON ISV two massive VALKYRIE SHUTTLES are mated to a DOCKING NODE. One of them separates from the starship and moves away, its thrusters FIRING in short bursts. As the shuttle moves away, descending toward Pandora, we hear the sound of DRUMS, building, louder and louder until we CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST TWILIGHT FLYING OVER A LANDSCAPE of massive cliffs and towering mesas carpeted in rainforest. Great scarves of cloud swirl around the mesa tops. A primeval landscape, vast and forbidding. The trees are alien, the color too cyan. There are waterfalls, rivers, and distant flocks of WINGED CREATURES. Suddenly the carpet of virgin rainforest gives way to AN OPENPIT MINE. A lifeless crater as if a giant cookie cutter took a chunk out of the world. Down among the terraces are EXCAVATORS and TRUCKS the size of three story buildings. And beyond the mine is the HUMAN COLONY . EXT. HELLS GATE TWILIGHT HELLS GATE is a cluster of squat concrete and steel structures surrounded by chainlink FENCE meters high, topped with razor wire. At the corners are towers with automated SENTRY GUNS swiveling on servo mounts. Visible beyond the gun towers, the VALKYRIE SHUTTLE roars in across the treetops. VECTORING NOZZLES change angle, bringing the ship to a SLOW HOVER. EXT. RAIN FOREST TWILIGHT Through a screen of jungle canopy, we see the VALKYRIE thunder overhead. Camera TILTS with it until leaves block the view. A BLUE INHUMAN HAND reaches INTO SHOT, parting the foliage to reveal the shuttle hovertaxiing across the compound. REVERSE ECU of two intense, catlike golden EYES watching. INT./EXT. SHUTTLE The CREW CHIEF stomps down the aisle yelling CREW CHIEF Exopacks on! Passengers don their EXOPACK breathing gear with practiced moves. Everybody except JAKE, whos turning his this way and that trying to figure out the straps. CREW CHIEF Remember people, you lose your mask youre unconscious in seconds and youre dead in four minutes. Lets nobody be dead today, it looks bad on my report. The crew chief stops by Jake long enough to bark CREW CHIEF Exopack on, lets go! BENEATH THE SHUTTLE air blasts outward for a hundred meter radius as it settles onto its landing gear. INSIDE everybody is queued up in the aisles, with duffles ready. Rows of tense, expectant faces in breathing masks and we DIP DOWN to find Jake, wheelchair putting him at the level of everyone elses WAISTS. . THE CARGO RAMP OPENS with a hydraulic whine. CREW CHIEF Go directly into the base! Do not stop! Go straight inside! HANDHELD, running with the arriving colonists who double time down the ramp. They jog across the exposed apron toward a walkway covered in CHAINLINK which leads to the complex. Inside the chainlink tunnel are a couple of SECOPS TROOPERS, CORPORAL LYLE WAINFLEET and PRIVATE FIKE. SecOps is the colonys private security force. These guys are laid back, hardened, and haggard. WAINFLEET Look at all that new meat. THEIR POV Jake rolls down the ramp. FIKE Check it out, man. Meals on wheels. WAINFLEET That is just wrong. Jake, pumping his chair, looks around as A huge TRACTOR, taller than a house, ROARS past on muddy wheels. He notices something sticking in the tires ARROWS. The neolithic weapons are jarring amid all the advanced technology. Beyond the tractor, two VTOL vehicles take off. Armored and heavily armed, they are AT SCORPION GUNSHIPS. MITSUBISHI MK AMPSUITS human operated walking machines meters tall patrol the perimeter. They are heavily armored, and armed with a huge rotary cannon called a GAU. Beyond the outer fence stands a black wall of forest hundreds of feet high. A SENTRY GUN OPENS FIRE from a tower. TRACERS light up the twilight. A shadowy SHAPE SHRIEKS and drops off the fence. It is an armed camp in a state of siege. WAINFLEET and Fike give Jake and his chair the hairy eyeball as he approaches. JAKE Whatre you two limpdicks starin at? As Jake rolls past, SOMETHING SWOOPS down behind him and . KKRASH! SMASHES against the chainlink right next to his head. A vicious AERIAL PREDATOR a meter across gnashes glass fangs against the steel. It STABS at him through the chain link with a tail ending in a glistening stiletto. A STINGBAT. WAINFLEET casually BLASTS IT with his PISTOL. It drops off the fence, tail still lashing. WAINFLEET Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up in one. Jake stares at the gnashing fangs of the dying alien. ON A WALKWAY of the OPS CENTER, seen from above, a UNIFORMED FIGURE grips the railing, watching Jake pump his chair through the tunnel below. The hair is clipped short. The scalp is etched by long parallel SCARS where some Pandoran denizens claws raked across it. The bare arms, below tightly rolled sleeves, seem hewn out of some hard tropical wood. Crisscrossed by scars. The MAN raises his masked face to look at the sky. He eyes are an icy steel gray. HIS POV the mighty POLYPHEMUS seems to fill the sky, beyond the clouds. MAN (V.O.) You are not in Kansas any more... CUT TO: INT. COMMISSARY TWILIGHT THE MAN from the balcony COLONEL MILES QUARITCH is the HEAD OF SECURITY for the Hells Gate colony. A hundred new arrivals watch raptly as he paces like a panther across the front of the large cafeteria. He stops, stance wide. Without his mask, we see that Quaritchs features are rugged and handsome, except for the SCAR, which runs from scalp to jaw down one side of his face. On one hip he carries a very large PISTOL. QUARITCH ... You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen. Respect that fact every second of every day. . JAKE ROLLS IN, watching from the back. COLONEL QUARITCH raises his hand and points out the window, toward the dark treeline. QUARITCH Out beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubees. The room gets very quiet. QUARITCH We have an indigenous population of humanoids here called the Navi. Theyre fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin which can stop your heart in one minute. We operate we live at a constant threat condition yellow. PAN ACROSS the solid faces of miners, Catmachine drivers, engineers, geologists, as they take that in. QUARITCH As head of security, its my job to keep you alive. I will not succeed (pausing for effect) not with all of you. If you wish to survive, you need a strong mental attitude, you need to follow procedure... PUSH IN ON JAKE, watching as the briefing continues. JAKE (V.O.) Nothing like an oldschool safety brief to put your mind at ease. CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR People are roaming in both directions, looking for rooms, lugging duffels and cases. An eager young XENOANTHROPOLOGIST, staggering under an overpacked duffel, runs to catch up to Jake. NORM Hey, youre Jake right? Toms brother? You look just like him. (off Jakes wary look) Sorry, Im Norm Spellman, I went through avatar training with him. . Norm offers his hand and Jake shakes it. NORM He was a great guy funny. It was a big shock to all of us. JAKE Yeah. Jake pumps the wheels of his chair, rolling on. Norm walks with him. NORM And duh! obviously you look like him. I mean, if you werent genetically identical, you wouldnt be taking over his avatar. JAKE Thats why Im here. NORM So you want to go check it out? CUT TO: INT. BIOLAB DAY JAKE AND NORM enter the BIOLAB a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms. MAX Me and Norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. Theyre grown from human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives here. A scientist, DOCTOR MAX CULLIMORE, is supervising the uncrating of two SHIPPING CONTAINERS. The nearer has the sides removed, revealing a ceilingheight acrylic TANK. Norm stops to stare, and Jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force, toward THE AMNIO TANK. There is a FIGURE floating lanquidly inside, which looks like a man. A very large, very blue, man. Blood circulates through a synthetic UMBILICAL in the abdomen. As the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see that it has a lemurlike TAIL. The skin is cyanblue. Long black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed. JAKE Damn. They got big. . NORM Yeah, they mature on the trip out. (to Max) So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well. MAX Yeah, theyve got great muscle tone. Give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin. THE FIGURES sleeping face turns toward us, and the features are despite feline ears and a long feral snout definitely JAKES. JAKE It looks like him. NORM No, it looks like you. This is your avatar now, Jake. ON JAKE, mesmerized as he stares into the tank. JAKE (V.O.) The idea is every driver is matched to his own avatar STEREOCAM VIDEO SHOT OF JAKE facing the camera, talking directly to the lens. JAKES VOICEOVER up until now has been part of this VIDEOLOG. JAKE so their nervous systems are in tune. Or something. Which is why they offered me this gig, because I can link with Tommys avatar, which was insanely expensive. (looking off camera) Is this right? I just say whatever in these videologs? WIDER, showing Norm working nearby with Max. NORM Yeah. You just need to get in the habit of documenting everything what you see, what you feel its all part of the science. Good science starts with good observation. . JAKE Right. (to camera) So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science. (looks around) Never been in a lab before. MAX Log off. Its time to meet your boss for the next five years. He leads Jake and Norm through the short corridor to the CUT TO: INT. LINK ROOM DUSK The LINK ROOM contains a dozen PSIONIC LINK UNITS, which look like coffins crossed with MRI scanners. NORM Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote the book I mean literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany. MAX (low, over his shoulder) That's because she likes plants better than people. DR. GRACE AUGUSTINE sits up in her link, stretching and cracking her neck after a long session. Shes fifty, with a strong face and fiercely intelligent eyes. GRACE (yelling) Whos got my goddamn cigarette?! A TECH scurries to bring it to her, already lit. Around here they jump when Grace barks. Grace stands, scowling, as Jake, Norm and Max approach. MAX And here she is, Cinderella back from the ball. Grace, Id like you to meet Norm Spellman and Ja GRACE Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi? . NORM (Na'vi, subtitled) May the All Mother smile upon our first meeting. Grace nods approvingly, taking a drag on her cigarette. GRACE (subtitled) Not bad. You sound a little formal. NORM (subtitled) There is still much to learn. Jake waits while they ignore him, chattering in fluent Navi. MAX Uh, Grace, this is Jake S GRACE (turning to Jake) Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I dont need you. I need your brother. (to Max) You know the PhD who trained three years for this mission. JAKE Hes dead. I know its a big inconvenience to everyone. GRACE How much lab training have you had? Ever run a gas chromatograph? JAKE No. GRACE Any actual lab work at all? JAKE High school chemistry. But I ditched. Grace wheels on Max. GRACE You see? You see? Theyre pissing on us without even the courtesy of calling it rain. (turning away) Im going to Selfridge. . She shoves past Jake. MAX Grace, thats not a good idea. But shes already out the door and clomping down the corridor. Max turns to Jake with a pained look. MAX Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred. Try to use big words. CUT TO: INT. OPS CENTER DUSK It looks like an airtraffic control tower, with lots of screens and bay windows showing the whole complex. ADMINISTRATOR PARKER SELFRIDGE takes a ball from a newly opened case of TITLEISTS and sets it on the floor. Selfridge is young, charismatic, focused. Some would say ruthless. He assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a practice cup across the control room floor. He glances up as Grace strides toward him. GRACE Parker, I used to think it was benign neglect, but now I see youre intentionally screwing us. SELFRIDGE Grace. You know I enjoy our little talks. GRACE I need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout. Selfridge looks down and hits the ball. Grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past. Selfridge looks at her with a sigh. SELFRIDGE Actually, we got lucky with him. GRACE Lucky? How is this in any way lucky? As Selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball . SELFRIDGE Well lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky the brother wasnt an oral hygienist or something. A Marine we can use. Im assigning him to your team as security escort. GRACE The last thing I need is another trigger happy asshole out there! SELFRIDGE Look, youre supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives. Isnt that the whole point of your little puppet show? If you look like them, if you talk like them, theyll trust you? Selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby. Grace follows. SELFRIDGE But after how many years? relations with the indigenous are only getting worse. GRACE That tends to happen when you use machine guns on them. On Selfridges desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid air, in the invisible field, is a lump of METALLIC ROCK. Pure UNOBTANIUM. He grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger, in front of Graces eyes. SELFRIDGE This is why were here. Unobtanium. Because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo. No other reason. This is what pays for the party. And its what pays for your science. Comprendo? He places it back in the magnetic field. SELFRIDGE Those savages are threatening our whole operation. Were on the brink of war and youre supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. So use what youve got and get me some results. CUT TO: . INT. LINK ROOM DAY NEXT MORNING, GRACE, NORM and JAKE approach their link units. Jake glances through a PRESSURE WINDOW. In an adjoining chamber (the AMBIENT ROOM) JAKES AVATAR lies on a gurney, breathing slowly in PANDORAN AIR. NORMS AVATAR is on a second gurney. Both are attended by med techs in exomasks. Norm slips into his LINK CHAIR, expertly donning biometric sensors. GRACE How much link time have you logged? NORM Five hundred and twenty hours. Grace looks pointedly at Jake. JAKE Like an hour. GRACE Tell me youre joking. Grace opens the hood of Jakes link unit. Jake starts hauling himself across from his wheelchair. She reaches to help him but JAKE Dont! I got this. Grace steps back, hands raised. He drags himself into the unit. GRACE So you just figured youd come out here to the most hostile environment known to man, with no training of any kind, and see how it went? What was going through your head? He meets her eyes with a defiant glare. JAKE Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling me what I couldnt do. Grace watches him laboriously pull his inert legs into the link chair by hand. . Jake settles into the warm fluid gel packs lining the unit. It seems to enfold him. Grace adjusts his biometric sensors, then lowers the UPPER CLAMSHELL GRACE Relax and let your mind go blank. That shouldnt be hard for you. JAKE Kiss the darkest part of my lily white But the SLAMMING HOOD muffles the rest. MAX Initiate link. The LINK TECH touches some controls. ON A LARGE MONITOR a D SCAN of Jakes brain appears. Regions of activity flow with complex shifting colors. MAX Thats a gorgeous brain. Nice activity. GRACE Go figure. (walking away) Alright, Im going in. TECH Phaselock at forty percent. Hes in transition. Max watches a display showing the avatars nervous system aligning with Jakes two ghostly networks of light merging. MAX Thats it. Find your way home. ECU JAKE, inside the link unit. His eyes move under the lids, like a dreamer in REM sleep as INSIDE JAKES MIND radiant streamers coalesce into a pulsing TUNNEL OF LIGHT and THE SCREEN FLARES WHITE ZZZWHAP! resolving into an overexposed, outoffocus image two BLURRY FACES wearing masks, looking down. ECU JAKES AVATAR two very intense eyes FILL FRAME, the pupils contracting. Golden irises pulse with life. . MAX Hes in. TECH Phaselock ninety nine percent. The link is stable. Blinking, Jake slowly sits up on the gurney. He looks down at his AVATAR BODY, touching his chest with one hand. MAX Take it slow, Jake. We need to check your motor control. Try touching your fingertips together But Jake isnt listening. Hes staring at his legs. He eases them off the gurney and HIS BLUE FEET touch the concrete floor, taking his weight. JAKE STANDS, feeling the strength in his legs. His expression is childlike with wonder. HIS POV looking down at the med techs, who seem the size of children next to his  tall frame. He sees something like a blue tentacle curl across his arm and he JERKS AROUND in alarm. HIS TAIL. As he turns to see it, the tail sweeps instruments off a table with a crash. Jake laughs and grins at Max. MED TECH Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down But Jake takes a step, then another. The wires to the bio monitors pull taut, and he yanks them off his chest. MAX Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests But Jake pushes past the protesting med techs, toward the door and EXT. AVATAR COMPOUND DAY Jake emerges, blinking in the morning sun. He finds himself in the AVATAR COMPOUND a living and training area. Nearby, a couple of AVATARS are playing oneonone in front of a (nonregulation height) basketball net. Others go about their daily activities around the compound. . Jake flexes his legs JUMPS and lands a little unsteadily, but his expression is joyful. He takes a few steps and breaks into a RUN. People are calling to him, somehwere, but he doesnt hear them hes running. RUNNING! He finds himself in the COMPOUND GARDEN, and stops amid neatly tended rows of ALIEN PLANTS. He looks down, wiggling his toes in the warm soil. Then inhales deeply revelling in the alien smells earth, plants, the nearby forest. He looks at his bare footprint in the soil of an alien world. GRACE (O.S.) Hey Marine! Jake turns at the familiar voice to see A statuesque FEMALE AVATAR walking toward him. AVATAR GRACE is magnificent, with panther thighs, flat muscular stomach and firm athletes breasts. She wears shorts and a Tshirt. In human years she would be about . JAKE Grace? GRACE Well whod you expect, numbnuts? Think fast! She throws him a piece of Pandoran fruit, which he catches. GRACE Motor control is looking good. Jake bites into the fruit, the juice running down his chin. NORM (O.S.) Hey, check it out. Jake turns to see NORMS AVATAR posing like a bodybuilder chest shot, back shot, bis. NORM I am a living god. CUT TO: EXT. MINE PIT DAY A WIDE SHOT of the terraced crater of the UNOBTANIUM MINE. A quiet beat, then . KWHOOOOM! The entire face of one terrace is blown skyward in a chain of EXPLOSIONS. The shot blasts hundreds of tons of rock loose. LONG LENS ANGLES of enormous WHEELLOADERS shovelling up ore rich rock and dropping it into DUMP TRUCKS. EXT. RAINFOREST DAY A wall of steel FILLS FRAME. The DOZER BLADE crushes everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling. WIDER, showing the CLEARCUTTING operation near the mine, as a road is cut through the jungle. Remotely operated DOZERS three stories tall rip into the treeline. One of the dozers has rotating SLASHCUTTER, a vicious spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through the enormous tree trunks in a spray of woodshrapnel. The heavy machines are escorted by AMPSUITS. COLONEL QUARITCH, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing breathing masks and carrying almighty big AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. A BANSHEE a fearsome aerial predator HURTLES from above, diving toward them on wings meters across. We get a glimpse of glassy fangs before PPPOOM! Quaritch cranks off three rapid SHOTS with his massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a SHRIEK. It crashes near them and Quaritch FIRES two more well placed rounds. The newbies stare at the things barracuda teeth. QUARITCH For you pogues, this is a banshee. A small one. See, they like it when I bring fresh meat out here. And this clearcutting really stirs up the hornets nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If it moves, shoot it. If youre not sure its moving shoot it! If it looks like a bunch of flowers you want to take home to Sally Rottencrotch SHOOT IT! Whatre you gonna do? TROOPERS Shoot it, sir! QUARITCH Outstanding. Lets roll. . Quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his eyes scanning. Flanking the squad, LYLE WAINFLEET drives an AMPSUIT, his massive feet CRASHING through the underbrush. As his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the trail an intricate TOTEM of woven sticks, bones and feathers hanging across the trail like an orbweavers web. He tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it into the mud as he moves on. INT. AVATAR LONGHOUSE DUSK Jake sits on a wooden bed in a long hut of tropicalstyle construction beamed ceiling, open sides covered by screen. Around him the other avatars are bedding down for the night, pulling insect netting around their cots. In one hand, Jake holds the end of his long braided QUEUE of hair. CLOSE ON the queue the ends of the hair writhe slowly with their own life, like tendrils of a sea creature. JAKE Thats kinda freaky. GRACE switches off the overheads. GRACE Lights out amigos. See ya at dinner. Jake sits in the twilight, listening to the SCREECHES and HOOTS from the forest. Finally he lies down, CLOSING HIS EYES and INT. LINK ROOM NIGHT ECU HUMAN JAKE his eyes OPEN. Jake blinks, disoriented, as Max opens the upper clamshell of his link unit. In the next chair Grace sits up, yawning and cracking her neck as the scared tech runs to her with a lit cigarette. GRACE (looking down) Damn. Same old sack a bones. JAKE struggles with the dead weight of his legs as he hauls himself out of the unit. CUT TO . INT. COMMISSARY EARLY MORNING JAKE sits with GRACE, NORM and the other avatar drivers, while around them miners, troopers and other base personnel wolf their breakfasts. Grace is engaged in a heated conversation with another SCIENTIST. Jake, isolated from the conversations around him, notices PILOT TRUDY CHACON approaching, dressed in her flight suit. Shes a rockhard former Marine with thousands of flight hours out in the badlands. TRUDY Sully Colonel wants to see you in the Armor Bay. Jake gives Norm a puzzled glance and pivots from the table. He wheels away, led by Trudy. TIGHT ON GRACE, scowling as she watches him go. CUT TO: INT. ARMOR BAY MORNING JAKE AND TRUDY enter the ARMOR BAY, passing TILTROTORS under repair. There are the heavily armed SCORPIONS as well as several SA SAMSON workhorses outfitted with door guns and rocket pods. JAKE You guysre packing some heavy ordinance. TRUDY Yeah, cause were not the only thing flyin around out there. Or the biggest. Im gonna need you on a door gun, Im a man short. JAKE Yeah, no problem. She extends her fist and he taps it with his. TRUDY See ya on the flightline, zero nine. (she points) Hes down there. Jake rolls his chair along the central gallery of the Armor Bay, passing rows of AMPSUITS standing in service racks. Techs clamber over the suits, loading ordinance with cranes and lifts. . At the end of the row is a makeshift GYM area. QUARITCH is benchpressing massive plates. QUARITCH This low gravity makes you soft. (pushing the last rep) You get soft, Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning. Quaritch racks the bar and sits up, sweating but not winded. QUARITCH I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela that was some mean bush. Nothing like this here, though. You got heart kid, coming out here. JAKE I figured just another hellhole. Quaritch chuckles appreciatively, claps him on the shoulder. The CHIEF MECHANIC yells from the nearest AMPSUIT MECHANIC That servos in, Colonel, if you want to try it. Quaritch crosses to the suit, with Jake following. QUARITCH I was in First Recon a few years ahead of you. More than a few. Two tours in Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here and He points to his scarred face. QUARITCH They could fix this if I rotated back. But you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day whats out there. Besides, I cant leave He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree line. QUARITCH This is my war, here. Quaritch climbs the suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches. The suits gasturbine spools up with a rising WHINE. . QUARITCH The avatar program is a joke buncha limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the ground, right in the hostiles camp. The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the suit trembles with power. The air boils above the exhaust vents. Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic QUARITCH Looks good. (to Jake) I need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their cooperation, or hit em hard if they dont. Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. Or baggedandtagged. JAKE (nodding) That sounds real good, Colonel. So am I still with Augustine? QUARITCH On paper. You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for me? Jake nods. Quaritch brings the suit to life. He steps forward and pivots smoothly. He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing a WUSHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control. Hes impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind of man he respects focused, hard. Determined. QUARITCH Look, son I take care of my own. Get me what I need, Ill see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs. He raises the suits hand, and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge feet CLANGING KUNG! KUNG! KUNG! . INT. BIO LAB DAY GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX. GRACE Start calibrating. Were on the flight line in ten minutes. Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR. GRACE What did Atilla want? JAKE Just Marines comparin tattoos. GRACE (not buying it) Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine She stops, turning to drill him with a look. GRACE youre driving an avatar, now. That means youre in my world, got it? JAKE Got it. She turns and enters the LINK ROOM. INT. LINK ROOM Grace crosses to the controls of Jakes LINK UNIT. As the others catch up GRACE That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this (indicating link room) exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Navi wont even talk to us anymore. JAKE Then hows this supposed to work? . GRACE We have a new face. (turning to Norm) Youre fluent, youve studied the culture. Youre nonthreatening. The ones we know best the Omaticaya clan may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go titsup for good. NORM This is failing as a pep talk. Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link. JAKE How do we contact them? GRACE We dont. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect (pointedly to Jake) Not trampling everything in sight they may reach out to us. JAKE Or they may skin us and make a drum. Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body. GRACE Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking. She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we CUT TO: EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL DAY FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and cloudwreathed mesas. TRUDYS SAMSON TILTROTOR chases its shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is tiny in the vast primeval landscape. ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper WAINFLEET, in exomask and body armor, leans on his door gun, scanning for aerial predators. In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes. Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids. . TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a shallow river. TRUDY (INTERCOM) Sturmbeest herd, one oclock. Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see A herd of STURMBEEST massive sixlegged creatures reminiscent of buffalo thundering across the river. GRACE Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles. NORM The bull has the red on the dorsal armor? Grace nods approvingly. TIME CUT Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS. TIME CUT the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling in on the gorge below like its a gunrun. Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like hes about to puke. WAINFLEET Yo Chacon! Get some! Jake grins into the airstream. CUT TO: EXT. CLEARING DAY A small meadow among towering trees. The fernlike grass is beaten down in waves by the rotorwash as the Samson settles to the ground. Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle. He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree line warily, weapons aimed. Grace jogs forward to the cockpit, motioning Trudy to shut down. Trudy kills the Samsons TURBINES. Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back. . GRACE Stay with the ship. (for Jake) One idiot with a guns enough. WAINFLEET Whatever you say, Doc. Jake takes point as they enter the jungle. WAINFLEET (laughing) Yall have fun out there. EXT. RAINFOREST DAY The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien wildlife. TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper alert looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkeylike PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing through the sunlight streaming down in shafts. A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he passes. This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that react and move like animals. Jake whiteknuckles his rifle as if every shadow conceals razorfanged death. GRACE Relax, Marine. Youre making me nervous. She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the path, seemingly unconcerned. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST/ GLEN WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher. CUT TO: EXT. SCHOOL RUINS DAY They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it. . NORM How will they know were here? GRACE Im sure theyre watching us right now. Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the school, feeling unseen eyes. CUT TO: INT. SCHOOL RUINS TRACKING WITH JAKES BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and a few moldering CHILDRENS BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK. GRACE (O.S.) The kids were so bright, so eager to learn... they picked up English faster than I could teach it to them. WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table. GRACE Bring the soil probe right there, yellow case. Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings. Grace picks up a moldering copy of The Lorax by Dr. Seuss from the floor and puts it back on a shelf. GRACE (wistfully) The stingbats knock them off. I guess I always hope somebody will come back and read them. NORM Why dont they come back? GRACE (grimly) The Navi learned as much about us as they needed to know. Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard reaches out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate. Unmistakably BULLET HOLES. . JAKE (turning to her) What happened here? GRACE (sharply) Are you going to help with this gear? Weve got a lot to do. She turns away. Jake watches her as he jams equipment into his pack. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DAY CLOSE ON Graces blue hand gently brushing away soil, exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS. GRACE See, right here where the roots of the two trees interact. WIDER GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needlelike probe. Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots. JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters. He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulderhigh SPIRAL PLANTS called HELICORADIANS. He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish. Curious, Jake touches another SHTOONK! And another like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK! SHTOONK! A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground, REVEALING A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a sixlegged rhinoceros, but twice that size. Its massive, lowslung head has projections of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark. Its baleful eyes lock onto him. Jake raises his rifle. Grace, alerted by the creatures SNORTS, runs to where she can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE. GRACE Dont shoot. Youll piss it off. . The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its meter wide sledgehammer of a skull. JAKE Its already pissed off! GRACE Jake, that armors too thick. Trust me. Jake starts to back away. The hammerhead bellows again, pawing the earth. GRACE Its a territorial threat display. Do not run, or hell charge. JAKE What do I do? GRACE Hold your ground! The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide and runs straight at the thing. It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT. ON JAKE amazed the gambit worked. JAKE Oh yeah! Whos bad?! Thats right. SOMETHING rises up behind him out of focus A THANATOR. The most awesome land predator the universe has ever conceived This thing could eat a Trex and have the Alien for desert. It is a black sixlimbed panther from Hell, with an armored head and massive distensible jaws. JAKE, unaware of the advancing thanator, is still bracing the hammerhead JAKE Thats what Im talkin about, bitch! The bull wheels around, TRUMPETING in fear, and CRASHES away through splintering undergrowth. . JAKE Thats right motherf A guttural SNARL behind him. Jake spins in time to see THREE TONS of rippling thanator LAUNCH over him, landing between him and the hammerhead. The ground shakes. The thanator emits an earsplitting ROAR, enraged that the hammerhead got away. It twists on itself, turning to face Jake, and bares its fangs with a lethal HISS. JAKE What about this one? Run, dont run? What? GRACE Run. Definitely RUN! Jake BOLTS as The thanator LEAPS after him and Jake launches himself between two large trunks, forcing the beast to claw its way around to the side while Jake scrambles up around over a tangle of roots and SKRASH!! CLAWS SLASH the air behind him, EXPLODING bark off a trunk as JAKE wills himself forward in a frenzy. With rippling muscle the beast is airborne again, blacking out the sun but JAKE dives under a massive root system, and CRASH! Kindling rains around him as the beast tears into the roottrunks above him. Claws SLASH down next to him as he rolls and crawls Glistening jaws SMASH and SNAP against the barrier trunks, sending chunks of wood flying. Its spittle sprays across Jake, jaws inches away as He rolls onto his back, and FIRES his AR point blank but the rifle is SNATCHED out of his hands. The beast SCREECHES an ungodly WAIL of pain and rage and RIPS the ENTIRE TRUNK away. Jake scrambles to escape but GLISTENING JAWS lunge downward, SNAP SHUT and The creature rips Jake out of the tree, shaking him like a junkyard dog with a rabbit, only . It has him by the BACKPACK, so Jake unlatches it and He FLIES FREE as the thanator crushes the pack with its teeth. Giving Jake a moment to sprint away, but With a hideous BELLOW the thanator crashes after him, splintering trees. JAKE RUNS in a blur, dodging between trunks as a glistening black tornado shreds the forest behind him and He sees WATER ahead and DIVES OUTWARD with all his might The thanators jaws SNAP SHUT inches behind him as he flies out into open space and JAKE SPLASHES down into a swiftly moving river. The thanator LEAPS DOWN AFTER HIM, pursuing from rock to rock, its claws swiping like a grizzly fishing for salmon. Jake ducks under as FWHOOSH! black claws SLASH past his face amid turbulent bubbles. A WATERFALL ahead. Jake is swept over the falls, with the thanator SWIPING at him from a rock, just MISSING and Jake disappears down the throat of the thundering cataract. EXT. RIVER BELOW FALLS DAY The water boils below the cataract. Jakes head bursts through the surface, and he gasps for breath. He is carried along by the current, but manages to grab a limb on a fallen tree. He weakly pulls himself up, and just lies there gasping on the trunk. Above him, on the cliff, the THANATOR BELLOWS, a roar which echoes across the jungle. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DAY JAKE, wet and bruised, crouches under a screen of giant leaves. He hacks manically at the end of a cut sapling with his knife, forming a crude but sharp tip. EXT. RAINFOREST DAY TRACKING with Jake as he walks through the forest like its a minefield, carrying his SPEAR whiteknuckled. He is freaked and hyperalert. . The trees here are a hundred meters high, blocking out the sky. A few pencil beams of sunlight filter down into the cyan gloom. POV FROM ABOVE looking down through leaves we watch Jake move warily through the forest. ECU TWO GOLDEN EYES, bright in the shadows. DOWNANGLE as Jake passes under a tree limb. Invisible to him, draped on the limb like a leopard, is a striking NAVI GIRL. She watches, only her eyes moving. She is lithe as a cat, with a long neck, muscular shoulders, and nubile breasts. And she is devastatingly beautiful for a girl with a tail. In human age she would be . Her name is NEYTIRI(nayTeeree). Jake passes less than meters beneath her, oblivious. NEYTIRI rises soundlessly. In one fluid, sinuous movement she NOCKS an arrow to her BOW and DRAWS, aiming RIGHT AT JAKE. Utterly silent. Below her Jake is totally unaware of the arrow aimed at his THROAT. ON NEYTIRI as she follows him with the bow, muscles tensing for the shot and SOMETHING drifts down in front of her, F.G. She hesitates. RACK FOCUS to the tip of the arrow where a single WOODSPRITE floats down to land on the arrowhead.Like a dandelion seed, but larger, the WOODSPRITE waves its silky CILIA, feather light, as it balances on the deadly point. It glows faintly in the dark shadows. NEYTIRI frowns, puzzled, and LOWERS her bow slowly. The woodsprite WHIRLS away into the gloom. CUT TO: INT./EXT. SAMSON SUNSET GRACE and NORM peer down into the shadowed forest as TRUDY banks in a search pattern. TRUDY (INTERCOM) Im going to have to call it, guys. Were not allowed to run night ops. Colonels orders. . Grace looks to the west. The sun setting behind alien trees. GRACE Shit. TRUDY Sorry, Doc. Hes just gonna have to hang on till morning. GRACE Hes not going to make it till morning. Grace stares into the dark forest as the Samson banks hard, thundering away toward the setting sun. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST NIGHT LONG LENS POLYPHEMUS. The giant planet rises behind the black trees. Jakes got a new problem. He sees shapes moving with liquid grace in the NIGHT shadows behind him. He is being stalked by a pack of VIPERWOLVES. Jake catches only glimpses a glint of eyes, a slinking black movement then nothing. Darkness. TIME CUT TIGHT ON Jakes hands as he knots his Tshirt around the butt end of the spear. ANGLE ON THICK SAP trickling down a treetrunk. Jake jams the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it. A WATERPROOF MATCH from his survival kit lights the torch. The torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing, leaping shadows. Jake turns warily as he moves along the trail. Behind him are several pairs of reflective green EYES. Another pair flanking him beside the trail. Blackonblack SHAPES which seem to flow like liquid. He looks up sees one cross a limb overhead. Another on his opposite flank. Then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic LAUGH. The VIPERWOLVES can run like a dog and climb like a monkey. They are hunting Jake from the ground and the trees. . JAKE RUNS by torchlight, on the edge of panic. He reaches a steep banked stream and without thinking runs across it on a horizontal trunk and STOPS DEAD on the other side. The torch illuminates GREEN EYES cutting ahead of him across the trail. The viperwolves have him encircled. The psychotic BARKS become more intense as they signal each other, getting excited. ONE MAKES A RUN at him, angling on his legs from behind but JAKE WHIRLS, jamming the torch in its face. It yips and goes past, but ANOTHER moves in He jabs it with the business end of the spear and it SNARLS, retreating, baring its fangs. Now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees what hes up against. The VIPERWOLVES are sixlimbed with shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery BLACK HANDS. Intelligent eyes. Glistening black teeth in dead white gums. Jake realizes that he is making his final stand. He whirls the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay And feels a rush of adrenaline. It goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone. JAKE (screaming) I dont have all goddamn night! Come on! Come on! With snarls and a blur of motion THEY ATTACK. Jake CRACKS the spear down on one, then SPINS as ANOTHER LEAPS at him and he plants the spear in it, striking true, but Its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes flying. Left in semidarkness, Jake draws his KNIFE as A WOLF LUNGES, sinking its teeth into his arm. He YELLS in pain and fury, SLASHING with the knife which CUTS deep into the beasts shoulder and it lets go. JAKE SPRINTS, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf leaps, GRABBING him by the ankle with its forehand. Jake tears away, sprawling, SCRAMBLING to get up as . THREE WOLVES charge at once. The nearest LEAPS at his throat just as THUNK!! an ARROW appears in its chest. The wolf lands on him, already a dead weight. He pushes it off in time to see A BLUE AMAZON emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw and FIRE in one fluid motion. AN UNEARTHLY YOWL as another wolf falls. NEYTIRI LEAPS right over Jake, and CRACKS her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf. ANOTHER SPRINGS at her and she drops under its weight, but rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand. Her knife FLASHES down, buried to the hilt in its chest. SNARLING, a wounded wolf attacks Jake, and he KICKS it away, but It SPINS and leaps back onto him, and Jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the SNAPPING JAWS away from his face. MEANWHILE Neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, CRACKING IT across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves. NEYTIRI Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!! The wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past them. Finally they break and run, with Neytiri chasing and They bound away through the foliage as she SHOUTS after them NEYTIRI Raaaarrrr! Jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight. Finally it stops thrashing. Panting, he releases it and looks up at NEYTIRI. Her tail LASHES as she scans the forest, listening to the fading YELPS of the wolves. Satisfied the attack is over, she turns. She regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him. Neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream. JAKE Wait, dont . Jake blinks around at the darkness realizing he can still see. In fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest is transformed. The jungle has come alive with BIOLUMINESCENCE spots and patterns, ghosts and galaxies of bluegreen light. Jake scrambles to recover his spear. Neytiri kneels beside A DYING WOLF. Its CRIES are pitiful. It paws the air, trying to raise its head. She pulls her KNIFE from its chest. NEYTIRI (in Navi) Forgive me, my brother. She cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. She touches its head gently, regarding it with sadness. Neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist. She crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling the arrow from its heart. JAKE Look, um, I know you probably dont understand this. But thanks. Thank you. I owe you. Neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal. NEYTIRI (in Navi) Forgive me. May your spirit run with the Great Mother. JAKE I would have been screwed if you hadnt come along She rises and walks away without looking at Jake. JAKE Hey, wait. Wait! Where you goin? He crashes through some plants, catching up to her. JAKE Slow down a second will you. I just want to thank you for killing those He makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and . WHACK! She WALLOPS him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat. He looks up to see a FURY standing over him. A Fury who speaks English accented, halting, angry English. NEYTIRI Dont thank! You dont thank for this! This is sad. Very sad, only. JAKE Okay, Im sorry. Whatever I did Im sorry. She gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves. NEYTIRI All this is your fault! They did not need to die. JAKE They attacked me. Howm I the bad guy here She silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat. NEYTIRI Your fault! You are like a baby, making noise, dont know what to do. You should not come here, all of you! You only come and make problems. Only. Jake gets up, slowly, facing her. JAKE Okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. So why not just let them kill my ass? Whats the thinking? CU Neytiri looking away. Finally, reluctantly, her eyes MEET HIS for the first time a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs. NEYTIRI Why save you? JAKE Yes, why save me? NEYTIRI You have a strong heart. No fear. She leans closer . NEYTIRI But stupid! Ignorant like a child! She turns away, stalking off, but Jake goes after her. TRACKING WITH Neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge ROOT. WIDER as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which forms an elevated walkway. Jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor. Throughout the following they move through a GLOWING PHANTASMAGORICAL FOREST. JAKE If Im so ignorant, maybe you should teach me. NEYTIRI Sky people can not learn. You do not See. She leaps to another elevated root. Jake follows, surprised that he made it. JAKE Whooaa. He runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace. JAKE Then teach me to see. She stops and he almost runs into her. NEYTIRI No one can teach you to See. Then she turns and trots on. EXT. GORGE NIGHT They run across the elevated root of an enormous tree a horizontal trunk big as an oak. WIDE SHOT as they cross a DEEP GORGE. A waterfall shimmers silver in the Polyphemuslight. Vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers. JAKE Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just got off on the wrong foot and . Jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height. JAKE you just have to get to know me. Im Jake. Jake Sull A vine catches his spear and spins him off balance. He drops the spear and almost falls off the root. JAKE Whooaaa shit! Neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. He watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river. She pulls him upright. Shouts at him in English and Navi. JAKE I need your help. NEYTIRI You should not be here. JAKE So take me with you. NEYTIRI No. You go back. DOWN ANGLE FROM FAR ABOVE several WOODSPRITES float down through the trees. FOLLOW THEM as they descend silently toward Jake and Neytiri. NEYTIRI, sensing a presence, looks up to see The WOODSPRITES, PULSING with purpose, float right towards Jake. They dance gently around his shoulders and head. JAKE (off her amazed look) What? More woodsprites gather around him. Several ALIGHT on him. Jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid but somehow hes not. He spreads his arms. More sprites come, landing all over his arms, hands, body. JAKE What are they? CU NEYTIRI reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread. . NEYTIRI Atokirina. Seeds of the Great Tree very pure spirits. Jake now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering MASS OF LIGHT moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. He studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until WHOOSSHH! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering into the darkness. JAKE What was that all about? Neytiri seems shaken. She seizes his hand and pulls him after her. NEYTIRI Come! CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST NIGHT TRACKING WITH JAKE as he gazes about him in growing wonder. He touches leaves as he passes, watching the bioluminescence shiver through them. Jake looks down as they cross a bed of purple MOSS which reacts to the pressure of their footsteps. Rings of green light, like ripples on a pond, expand outward from each footfall. Exploding rings of light where his feet touch down. Dreamlike, surreal beauty. WIDE ON THEM as they run over a large root, across a mirror like POOL at the base of a WATERFALL. Jake follows Neytiri, running along a raised roottrunk. JAKE Whats your name? JAKE hears WHOOSHWHOOSH and snaps a look as a BOLO flies at him, spinning end for end and SHWHAP!! tangles around his legs. He topples off the root and crashes into the foliage below. JAKE untangles himself, getting up to run just as SEVERAL NAVI RIDERS thunder toward him. They are riding DIREHORSES sixlegged, armorskinned alien Clydesdales. . We see that the riders QUEUES are connected to the horses long mothlike antennae a neurallink with which they can command the horse, leaving hands free for weapons. The riders aim bows and spears at Jake as they approach. Jake turns to bolt, but NAVI HUNTERS melt out of the shadows, weapons aimed blocking his retreat. Neytiri drops to the ground next to Jake and confronts the LEAD RIDER. She shouts sharply in Navi NEYTIRI (subtitled) Tsutey, what are you doing?! He is my captive! TSUTEY(tsuTay)is young and powerfully built, with sculpted features and a proud jawline, piercing eyes. Tsu'tey swings off his mount with fluid grace. TSUTEY (subtitled) These demons are forbidden here. I will kill this one as a lesson to the others! Tsutey draws his bow but Neytiri leaps between him and Jake, confronting him warrior to warrior. NEYTIRI (subtitled) Stop! There has been a sign. This is a matter for the Tsahik. Tsutey clenches his jaw with frustration frustration with her as much as the situation. He turns and angrily remounts his direhorse, barking a command to the HUNTERS. TSUTEY (subtitled) Bring him. They grab Jake and haul him to his feet. Encircled by spears and bows, he is shoved forward along the trail, as Tsutey and the others ride ahead. CUT TO: EXT. HOMETREE NIGHT JAKE is hauled roughly toward Neytiris village, which is sheltered inside one of the GREAT TREES. HOMETREE is meters tall, with a trunk four times the diameter of the largest Sequoia, and a base of massive mangrovepillars. . TSUTEY rides inside the columns at the base of Hometree, shouting an ululating WARNING. Jake is forcemarched through the pillars into INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE NIGHT An open CENTRAL AREA. The villagers gather to see the arriving hunt party. We see the people of the tribe mothers with babies, old women, young hunters. They gawk at the alien, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright hostility. The huge eyes of the children follow him. Jake is amazed at the size of HOMETREE inside. By the light of the COOKFIRES he can see up into a vast cylindrical gallery a living cathedral. Clear membranes sturmbeest bladders filled with fluttering bioluminescent insects, act as area lighting. The central space is dominated by the SKULL of some enormous creature, mounted with much embellishment on a TOTEM. Standing in front of this, awaiting their approach, is EYTUKAN (AYtookahn), the Clan Leader. Eytukan has deeply chiselled features and a long chest mantle of THANATOR CLAWS. His normally stern features are clouded further by anger. EYTUKAN (subtitled) Why do you bring this creature here? Neytiri addresses Eytukan in Navi. NEYTIRI (subtitled) I was going to kill him, but there was a sign from Eywa. He glowers at her as he responds, pointing at Jake. EYTUKAN (subtitled) I have said no dreamwalker will come here, to offend our home! His alien smell fills my nose Neytiri stands her ground, answering in a respectful but not submissive tone. . NEYTIRI (subtitled) Father, many atokirina came to this alien. JAKE Whats going on? NEYTIRI My father is deciding whether to kill you. JAKE Your father!? (to Eytukan) Uh, good to meet you, sir. Jake steps forward, offering his hand, and the hunters JUMP to restrain him, shouting. But they all FREEZE as A commanding FEMALE VOICE echoes through the chamber. MOAT (Navi) Step back! Everybody looks up. MOAT (MOHaht) stands on the second level, looking down. She is a severe woman in her s. Her bearing is haughty, her expression friendly as a hangingjudge. Her outfit is elaborate, denoting her rank as CLAN MATRIARCH. MOAT (subtitled) I will look at this alien. There is an expectant hush as Mo'at descends the helical core of Hometree, a kind of natural spiral staircase. NEYTIRI That is Mother. She is Tsahik the one who interprets the will of Eywa. JAKE Whos Eywa? Neytiri kneels before her like an acolyte as Moat passes. The villagers stare silently as the Matriarch circles slowly around Jake, examining his tail and the end of his queue. . MOAT (thick accent) What are you called? JAKE Jake Sully. She produces a long THORN between her fingertips. With a flourish she strikes his chest. Jake flinches. RED BLOOD wells up and Mo'at rubs some between her fingertips. She tastes it. MO'AT Why did you come to us? JAKE I came to learn. MO'AT We have tried to teach other Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full. JAKE My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask Doctor Augustine. Im no scientist. MO'AT What are you? JAKE I dont know. I was a Marine uh, a warrior. Of the Jarhead clan. TSUTEY (subtitled) A warrior! I could kill him easily! EYTUKAN (subtitled) No! This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him. JAKE Whats going on? What are they saying? MOAT (to Neytiri, subtitled) Daughter. You will teach him our way, to speak and walk as we do. . NEYTIRI looks shocked, then angry. NEYTIRI (subtitled) Why me? That's not fair! I only MOAT (subtitled) It is decided! Neytiri subsides, turning to glare at Jake. MO'AT (to Jake) My daughter will teach you our ways. Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if your insanity can be cured. She turns to Neytiri, her expression stern MO'AT (subtitled) He is your responsibility. Neytiri nods, accepting, but shes not a happy camper. She grabs Jakes arm and pulls him roughly away. JAKE So its all good, right? You and me NEYTIRI Do not speak. CUT TO: INT. SECOND LEVEL/HOMETREE LATER, Neytiri leads Jake up the spiral to the SECOND LEVEL. He now wears only a ratty LOINCLOTH. His wounds are bound with plantfiber bandages. THE ENTIRE CLAN is squatting at dinner in a huge circle. They stop talking and turn to gaze at Jake as he enters the circle. JAKE Dont get up. Neytiri crosses the circle to the cook pit and returns with several large leaves heaped with food. She kneels next to Jake, placing the food in front of him almost DEFIANTLY. JAKE You never told me your name. . NEYTIRI Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'atite. JAKE Okay, again, a whole lot slower. NEYTIRI (exaggerated slowness) Neytiri. NayTEEree. Jake knows shes baiting him. He smiles in response. JAKE NayTEEree. Thats nice. NayTEEree. ACROSS THE CIRCLE, Tsutey, Mo'at and Eytukan sit together, glancing up occasionally from their food to the stranger. TSUTEY (subtitled) These aliens try to look like people, but they cant. MO'AT (subtitled) He seems dim to me. And his eyes are too small. NEYTIRI motions for Jake to take portions from the serving leaves onto his own leaf. JAKE Your mom likes me. I can tell. MOAT, watching Jake and Neytiri, leans over to Eytukan. MO'AT (subtitled) Neytiri will test this warrior. Hey may learn nothing but we will learn much. EYTUKAN You speak truth. We must understand these Sky People if we are to drive them out. Jake munches on a white shrimplike thing. JAKE These rock. What are they? NEYTIRI Teylu. You call beetle larvae. . Jake blanches. She heaps some more onto his leaf a CHALLENGE and Jake meets her eyes, takes a handful, and starts munching enthusiastically. JAKE Thats some damn fine teylu. Thats like grandmas teylu. CU TSUTEY, warily eyeing Jake TSUTEY (subtitled) I say she will kill him. CUT TO: INT. THIRD LEVEL NIGHT The sleeping level families nesting in groups on woven hammocks the size of trampolines. The hunters sleep along SPOKES joining the inner trunk to the trees outer shell. Jake lies awake in a hammock, people rustling in the darkness around him. Neytiri is nearby, curled up like a little girl. She stares at him for a moment, then closes her eyes. Jake watches the glowing bugs fluttering inside a night light, a pulse of life energy. A strange peace spreads through him. He closes his eyes and CUT TO: INT. LINK ROOM NIGHT GRACE is over JAKE in the Link, SLAPPING him, as Max and NORM hover. GRACE Come on back, kid, thats it. JAKE Wha ? Oh. He looks around, blinking. Reality crashing in. GRACE Damn, you were dug in like a tick. (she helps him sit up) Is the avatar safe? JAKE (huge grin) Yeah, Doc and you are not going to believe where I am. CUT TO: . INT. COMMISSARY MORNING BREAKFAST the next day. The other drivers lean forward, hanging on Graces retelling of the tale. GRACE so the kids out there one night and hes got the Queen Bitch herself offering him the spare room and the car keys. Unbelievable. JAKE Its not something you can teach. Some of the other scientists clap Jake on the shoulders in congratulation. MAX Thats awesome, Jake. NORM chomps his bacon, fuming. GRACE (to Jake, getting serious) For reasons I cannot fathom, the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all. CUT TO: INT. OPS CENTER MORNING JAKE has reported to SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH. Quaritch turns from gazing out at the wall of forest, displaying a feral grin. QUARITCH Jarhead clan? (he laughs) And that worked? JAKE (grinning) Yeah. They want to study me. See if I can learn to be one of them. QUARITCH Thats how you seize the initiative. I wish I had ten more like you. SELFRIDGE Look, Sully find out what these blue monkeys want. . (MORE) We try to give them medicine and education. Roads! But no they like mud. I wouldnt care except Selfridge turns to a large D GRAPHIC DISPLAY, pointing. A road runs from Hells Gate to a proposed new mine miles away. SELFRIDGE Their damn village is sitting right over the richest unobtanium deposit for a hundred klicks in any direction. Which sucks for them because they need to relocate. JAKE (taking that in) Does Augustine know about this? SELFRIDGE Yeah, she does, and shes on the next ship back if she tries to cockblock me on it. JAKE So who talks them into moving? QUARITCH (turning) Guess. JAKE What if they wont go? QUARITCH (icy) Im betting they will. SELFRIDGE Killing the indigenous looks bad, but theres one thing shareholders hate more than bad press and thats a bad quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to get them to move, or its going to have to be all stick. Jake is shaken by the enormity of this new responsibility. QUARITCH You got three months. Thats when the dozers get there. JAKE Im on it. CUT TO: . SELFRIDGE (cont'd) INT. BIO LAB MORNING JAKE pumps his chair across the lab, flanked by GRACE and NORM. Grace holds STEREO STILL PICTURES in front of him, one at a time images of clan members she has shot over the years a kind of flash card drill. JAKE Tsutey. (next photo) Moat. (next photo) Eytukan. GRACE Hes the clan leader (indicating Moat) but shes the spiritual leader. Like a shaman. INT. LINK ROOM The dialogue is continuous as they enter. JAKE Got it. So whos this Eywa? NORM Whos Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The Great Mother. The goddess made up of all living things. Youd know that if you had any training whatsoever. He hauls himself from wheelchair to Link. JAKE Whos got a date with the chiefs daughter? GRACE Knock it off. Jesus, its like kindergarten around here. As Jake settles into the soft embrace of the link, Grace inputs commands at the control station. GRACE Neytiri was my best student. She and her sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls. JAKE I didnt meet the sister. . GRACE (quietly) No, shes dead. (turning to him) Okay, lets go village life starts early. MAX Link is ready. Grace lowers the biosensor array over Jakes chest. GRACE Dont do anything unusually stupid. She closes the clamshell and we INT. HOMETREE/ THIRD LEVEL DAY CU JAKES AVATAR, blinking awake, staring up at HOMETREE, like a gothic cathedral overhead. Sunlight streams down through gaps in the towering vault. CUT TO: INT. COMMONS DAY JAKE walks among the villagers, who go about their daily tasks. young girls sit together, weaving and SINGING. They look up as he passes, then go back to work. two men clean the fish theyve caught. a young mother pounds seeds into meal, while nursing an infant. children chase each other and climb like monkeys. One bold LITTLE GIRL runs up to Jake, stops staring then shrieks with laughter as she runs back to her playmates. GRINNING, Jake turns to see NEYTIRI cantering toward him on a DIREHORSE. She leads a second horse, an old swaybacked MARE. His grin drops. EXT. RIVER NEAR HOMETREE DAY JAKE nervously grips the surcingle of the mare. Neytiri holds its nosering while Jake clumsily mounts. Jake bends one of its ANTENNAE down to the tip of his queue. He hesitantly touches them together and . TIGHT SHOT the tendrils INTERWEAVE. Jakes PUPILS DILATE and his mouth drops open. The horses eyes also go wide and it HONKS nervously. Neytiri touches her fingertips to the neural interface. NEYTIRI This is shahaylu the bond. Feel her heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong legs. Jake closes his eyes, nodding. One with the horse. TSUTEY and another young hunter come out of the forest leading TWO DIREHORSES. The magnificent animals drink from the edge of the pool. Tsutey watches Jakes riding lesson with disdain. NEYTIRI You may tell her what to do (she touches her head) inside. For now, say where to go. JAKE Forward. The horse LAUNCHES into a GALLOP. Jake flops around, with no idea how to sit the animal, and is promptly THROWN OFF. He lands painfully in the mud. He gets up, brushing mud off knees and ass, as Neytiri leads the horse back to him. NEYTIRI Again. SERIES OF JUMP CUTS Jake falls off the horse in various ways, seemingly landing harder each time. ON JAKE, face down in the mud of the riverbank. He painfully rises to hands and knees. Which is when he sees TSUTEY and another HUNTER thundering across the shallow river on their direhorses. Spray blasts up from their hooves. Jake stands, covered in mud, as Tsutey stops his horse next to him, looking down with disdain. TSUTEY You should go away. . JAKE (to Neytiri) I knew this guy could speak English. Tsutey turns to Neytiri, who is leading the old mare back. TSUTEY (subtitled) This alien will learn nothing. A rock Sees more. She sighs in agreement. Tsutey and the other hunter wheel their horses around and THUNDER OFF into the woods. NEYTIRI gestures to Jakes horse. NEYTIRI Again. CUT TO: OPS CENTER NIGHT Grouped around a table are JAKE, COLONEL QUARITCH, SELFRIDGE and few ENGINEERS and OFFICERS. Jake is talking them through plans hes made of Hometrees inner structure. JAKE Youve got outer columns, then a secondary ring here, and an inner ring. Then a core structure, its like a spiral, thats how they move up and down. QUARITCH Im going to need accurate scans of all these columns. JAKE Roger that. ANGLE ON MAX, at the stairwell. Hes been watching Jake talking rapidly to Quaritch, but cant hear him. Frowning, he backs away, down the stairs. CUT TO: INT. BIO LAB DAY JAKE, GRACE and NORM are packing science gear and supplies. GRACE Im not about to let Quaritch and Selfridge micromanage this thing. (she looks pointedly at Jake) Were going up into the mountains. . (MORE) Theres a mobile link up at Site that we can work out of. NORM The Hallelujah Mountains? GRACE Thats right. NORM Yesssss! (off Jakes look) The legendary Floating Mountains of Pandora? Heard of them? CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST AERIAL DAY A SAMSON THUNDERS over the rainforest, climbing into the mist shrouded mountains. In the SEALED COCKPIT, Norm is up front, sitting left seat so Trudy can talk him through the flight controls. Jake and Grace are behind them, in the jumpseats. Grace and Norms UNCONSCIOUS AVATARS ride in the open back compartment. TRUDY It only takes tiny inputs. Here, put your hand on the cyclic She points to the stick between her knees. Norm hesitantly reaches over and rests his hand on hers. TRUDY Feel how small the moves are? You barely have to think it, and the aircraft reacts. ON NORM reacting to tiny inputs from the hot ladypilot. THE SAMSON is dwarfed by enormous ARCHES OF ROCK. GRACE See these magnetic formations. Were getting close. TRUDY Yeah we are. Look at my instruments. On the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out. . GRACE (cont'd) GRACE Yup. Were in the flux vortex. AHEAD, a cloud bank parts, revealing THE HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS. Right in front of them. NORM Oh. My. God. Jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out the front canopy. JAKES POV enormous islands of rock are hovering a half mile above the ground. They are overgrown with rainforest, and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them. Waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at the bottom. ON JAKE, staring in amazement. It is both aweinspiring and disturbing. Trudy turns, grinning at Jake. TRUDY You should see your face. WIDE AERIAL the Samson is tiny as it approaches the floating islands of rock. An archipelago among the clouds, they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below. JAKE (V.O.) Yeah, so what does hold them up? Grace explained it to me some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor, or something. At least somebody understands it. Just not me. CUT TO: EXT. SITE DAY A remote RESEARCH STATION TWO SHACKS and a few clusters of instruments perched on a promontory near the Hallelujah Mountains. The shacks are AIRLIFT MODULES the size of buses. THE SAMSON LANDS, beating the grass with its rotorwash. The humans hop out, wearing MASKS. They move toward the Shack, taking in the spectacular panorama. CUT TO: . INT. SHACK DAY NORM and TRUDY assist JAKE with his chair as they cycle in through the AIRLOCK. GRACE is already inside, starting the GENNY. She turns on the lights and equipment. There are bunks, a clutter of science gear, and through a short connecting corridor THREE LINK UNITS in the second module. As Grace powers up the Link equipment, Jake stops to look at STEREO STILL PICTURES which are taped and tacked up around her workstation. CLOSE ON PICTURES Grace posing at the school with various grinning children. There is one of her with two lanky girls, a younger Neytiri and an older girl who looks much like her. GRACE Jake, take number two, its the least glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate Jakes link. Norm glares at Jake as he passes. JAKE Hey. You got a problem? Norm turns to Grace, his frustration boiling over. NORM I trained three years for this mission. I speak the language fluently. (he points at Jake) He falls off the frickin turnip truck and all of a sudden hes cultural ambassador!? GRACE Its not our choice, Norm. He glowers at Jake. NORM Yeah, well I didnt come out here to wash the dishes while youre on some interspecies booty call. He stalks off. GRACE He cant go far. . She points to Jakes link. GRACE Lets get you in. CUT TO: INT./EXT. HOMETREE BANSHEE EYRIE LOOKING DOWN the central shaft of Hometree, meters to the ground. Villagers are antlike. Jake tries to keep up with Neytiri as she leaps up the core trunk like a lemur. He climbs the last section, arriving out of breath beside her. She leads him OUTSIDE, onto A large branch. Through gaps in the foliage Jake can see other Great Trees scattered across the landscape, like enormous umbrellas above the rainforest. NEYTIRI strides out across the branch toward some kind of STRUCTURE a WEB made of thick woven fiber. DARK SHAPES clinging to it stir with a leathery RUSTLING SOUND. Neytiri makes a series of TRILLS and CLICKS. One of the shapes MOVES toward them, emerging into a shaft of sunlight. A huge MOUNTAIN BANSHEE. Much larger than the forest banshees, this thing is taller than a Navi with a meter wingspan. A leathery FWHOOP, like the crack of sails, as it alights on the branch right in front of her. JAKE Holy shit. NEYTIRI Do not look in her eye. Neytiri feeds it a large scrap of meat, which it SNATCHES and gulps down. She murmurs to it and strokes its NECK. It lets out a signature SHRIEK, and some of the others in the shadows nearby answer. Neytiri flipcatches her queue and gently connects it to the Banshees ANTENNA. It shivers and stretches its wings as the neural connection is made. NEYTIRI Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter in the whole life. She climbs smoothly onto the animals back. . NEYTIRI To become taronyu Hunter you must choose your own ikran. And he must choose you. JAKE When? NEYTIRI When you are ready. The BANSHEE shivers with anticipation. NEYTIRI Heeyaaahh! Jake ducks as the great wings EXPLODE OPEN and the banshee DROPS off the branch. It swoops down across the forest canopy, banks hard, lets out a CRY and beats its wings in a power climb. Completing the bank, Neytiri directs the banshee into a close SWOOPING FLYBY, and Jake instinctively ducks. ON NEYTIRI flying in perfect fusion with her winged mount, the rainforest rolling beneath her. CUT TO: INT. SHACK NIGHT/EXT STEREO VIDEOLOG IMAGE Jake has just switched on the camera. He looks tired. JAKE Do I have to do this? I need some rack. GRACE, behind him, looks up from her MICROSCOPE, scowling. GRACE No now, when its fresh. JAKE Yeah, yeah. (to camera) The days are starting to blur together. The language is a bitch, but I figure its like fieldstripping a weapon. Repetition. THIS THROWS US INTO A TEACHING MONTAGE: JAKE AND NEYTIRI kneel together inside Hometree. Neytiri touches her lips with her fingertips. . JAKE Seyri. She touches her nose, her ears, her eyes in quick sequence. JAKE Ontu, mikyun, nari. NEYTIRI stands next to him, correcting his position as he draws a longbow. BARKING commands, she SMACKS him on the shoulder, then the elbow, repositioning him roughly. JAKE (V.O.) Neytiri thinks Im some kind of retard. HUMAN JAKE emerges from the LINK to see TRUDY and NORM caught IN THE ACT on Norms bunk. Norm blushes and Trudy waves, pulling the blanket over their heads. JAKE (V.O.) Norms attitude has improved lately. NORM works with JAKE at the small table in the SHACK kitchen. NORM Thank you? JAKE Ireiyo. Norm comically exaggerates the pronunciation. NORM Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo. Youve gotta roll the R, rrroll it. Norm makes Jake repeat the word, getting more frustrated. JAKE (V.O.) Its good hes back on board, but he thinks Im a retard too. TRACKING WITH JAKES FEET as he runs over rocks, leaping onto a thick root, running on across the rough bark. JAKE (V.O.) My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day. . Neytiri leads him along a massive root, and soon they are running meters above the ground. He sprints with her through the trees, trying to keep up. She CLIMBS and LEAPS with the ease of a spider monkey. JAKE (V.O.) I have to trust my body to know what to do. With Neytiri its learn fast or die. Neytiri LEAPS off into space, falling, falling until She catches an enormous palm leaf and, gripping it, allows its DROOP to slow her fall. She lets go, plummeting, and catches another. JAKE FOLLOWS in a leap of faith. THE CAMERA PLUNGES with him, from leaf to leaf, down and down in a dizzying kinetic rush. He drops down from the last leaf, landing next to her on a game trail. He is exhilarated to still be alive. Neytiri is surprised that he followed. That he lived. TIGHT ON HUMAN JAKE, in the shack. Thinking as he looks at the pictures of Grace with the laughing kids at the school. IN THE COMMONS AVATAR NORM formally greets MOAT. The Matriarch looks on as GRACE kneels to hug children she knows. Graces eyes sparkle as she chats with them in Navi. JAKE (V.O.) I sweettalked Mo'at into giving Norm and Grace a hall pass. Now Grace even makes me coffee before link every morning. Grace looks up to see Neytiri approaching. It is an awkward moment between them. Grace makes the formal gesture of greeting. GRACE (Navi, subtitled) I See you, Neytiri Moatite. NEYTIRI I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine. ANOTHER DAY NEYTIRI kneels on a game trail, pointing out the tracks in the mud to Jake. She touches the edges of the plants around her, and sniffs the air. . JAKE (V.O.) Im learning to read the trails, the tracks at the waterhole, the tiniest scents and sounds. JAKE AND NEYTIRI watch through a screen of leaves as A HERD of huge, armored STURMBEEST walks through the shallows of a lake. In the middle of the herd, the babies are sheltered from predators among their parents' legs. One of the BULLS trumpets, and a flock of TETRAPTERONS takes flight, an explosion of purple wings. Jake stares at the strange and wild alien tableau. ANOTHER PLACE NEYTIRI STANDS utterly still, except for her ears, which move with a life of their own. Her eyes are closed. She speaks very softly to Jake NEYTIRI When you hear nothing, you will hear everything. When you see nothing, you will See everything. JAKE (V.O.) Sometimes I have no idea what shes talking about. Jake and Neytiri creep quietly, stalking a large male HEXAPEDE a six legged deerlike creature. Jake expertly nocks an arrow and draws his bow as Neytiri watches. He takes a bead on the hexapede tracks it for a beat with the drawn bow, then RELAXES his arm. Zen archery. JAKE (V.O.) Its been a month and Im still not allowed to make a kill. She says the forest hasnt given permission. OMIITED NEYTIRI and JAKE crawl through the undergrowth. She points and he parts some leaves to see A MOTHER VIPERWOLF bringing meat to her cubs, which frisk around her legs. She licks their faces. JAKE (V.O.) Theres a lot of crap like that. Shes always going on about the flow of energy the spirits of the animals and what not . VIDEOLOG IMAGE HUMAN JAKE talks into the lens. Hes changing unshaven, cheeks hollow. Pale. JAKE (smirking) I just hope this treehugger shit isnt on the final. Visible behind him, Grace is hunched over her samples. GRACE (without looking up) This isnt just about eyehand coordination out there. You need to listen to what she says. Try to see the forest through their eyes. JAKE Excuse me this is my videolog here, okay? NEYTIRI AND JAKE move through the NIGHT FOREST, surrounded by galaxies of shimmering bioluminescence. They move gracefully, soundlessly two forest spirits. CU JAKE the pupils of his cat eyes dilated. The night forest floods his brain with its million biosources. NIGHT SHOT, from overhead Jake and Neytiri bowfishing from a dugout canoe over huge glowing ANEMONES at the bottom of a pool. A large fish swims silhouetted against the pastel glow. ZAP! Jake drills it. He holds up the fish, triumphantly. ANOTHER DAY Neytiri stands close behind Jake, adjusting his position as he draws his bow. Only now her hands are GENTLE as they move on his arms, his shoulders. Aware of her touch, Jakes focus is broken. Their eyes meet, and she pulls away quickly. NIGHT they enter a CLEARING filled with chesthigh ferns. Neytiri signals him to move slowly. They approach a creature on one of the ferns. An ugly, sticklike LIZARDTHING perched on a frond. As he approaches SNAP! A long spine whips in a circle, unfurling a bioluminescent membrane a disk a meter across, opening like a Chinese fan. It FLIES OFF, a living Frisbee. THE FAN LIZARD FLOATS across the clearing. . Neytiri plunges among the ferns with a SHARP CRY. An EXPLOSION OF COLOR as dozens of FAN LIZARDS take flight. Grinning widely, she hops around like a little girl, until they are all flying. And for the first time, she is unguarded and joyful, totally herself with him. INSIDE THE LINK Jakes eyes open in the darkness. He doesnt know where he is. He weakly pushes open the lid, blinking at the light. JAKE (V.O.) Everything is backwards now. Like out there is the true world, and in here is the dream. TIGHT ON AVATAR JAKE silently drawing his bow, his eyes focused in intense concentration. A beat the arrow flies. JAKE PULLS the arrow from the twitching body of a hexapede. He dispatches it with his knife. He speaks haltingly, but with feeling, in Navi. JAKE (Navi) I See you Brother, and thank you. Your spirit goes with Eywa, your body stays behind to become part of the People. NEYTIRI watches with approval. NEYTIRI A clean kill. You are ready. CUT TO: INT. SHACK NIGHT Lying in the link, Jake looks exhausted, pale, thin. Norm helps Grace get him to his chair. GRACE Youre still losing weight. Here She hands him a microwaved burrito. He looks at the now alien food. Bites into it without enthusiasm. JAKE I made a kill today. We ate it. I know where that meal came from. . GRACE Other body. You need to take care of this body. JAKE Yeah yeah. GRACE Jake, Im serious you look like crap. Youre burning too hard. Jake takes the cigarette out of her mouth and stubs it out. JAKE Get rid of this shit, then you can lecture me. GRACE Im telling you, as your boss and someone who might even consider being a friend someday, to take some down time. JAKE Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya. GRACE walks past Jake, starts making herself coffee. GRACE Yeah youre gonna go ride a banshee. Or die trying. JAKE Thats right, Grace. This is what Ive been working for. GRACE And this is your check up from the neck up, Marine. Youre getting in way too deep. (she turns away) Trust me, I learned the hard way. Jake scans the pictures tacked up around Graces workstation. JAKE What did happen at the school? GRACE looks up from making coffee. Her eyes track across the pictures of the laughing children. Finally . GRACE Neytiris sister Sylwanin stopped coming to school. She was angry about the clearcutting. GRACE sips her coffee, grimaces at the taste. GRACE One day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in, all painted up theyd set a bulldozer on fire I guess they thought I could protect them. GRACES voice stays oddly CALM as he tells this terrible story, while getting MILK out of the refrigerator. GRACE The troopers pursued them to the schoolhouse. MACRO as she pours the milk her hand is SHAKING. GRACE They killed Sylwanin in the doorway. Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the others. (mildly) I got most of the kids out, before they shot me. JAKE Jesus. GRACE Yeah. Jake realizes that Grace is on the verge of tears and desperately trying to hide it. GRACE A scientist stays objective we can not be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten years of my life into that school. They called me saatenuk. Mother. (turning to him) That kind of pain reaches back through the link. GRACE sits down at the table, looks intently at Jake. GRACE Its a job. Learn what you can but dont get attached. . GRACE looks at him with real PAIN in her eyes. GRACE Its not our world, Jake. And we cant stop whats coming. CUT TO: EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL DAY TSUTEY leads three direhorse riders up the trail two TEENAGE HUNTERS and JAKE, whos riding well enough to keep up. The horses hooves CLOP right next to a sheer drop into a misty canyon. JAKE (V.O.) Iknimaya translates roughly as stairway to heaven. Its the test every young hunter has to pass. TSUTEY signals a stop. UPSLOPE AHEAD is an astounding formation. Thick vinelike trees have trapped large FLOATING BOULDERS of UNOBTANIUM in their gnarled grip. A hundred meters above them more boulders are WOVEN into the twisted vinetrunks. This is some sort of freak natural occurrence like the mythical beanstalk, going up into the clouds. There is a THUNDERING ROAR, like an artillery barrage, and the ground SHAKES. Jake looks around at One of the FLOATING MOUNTAINS grinding against the flank of a nearby mesa. A huge rockfall is set loose. The mountain is drifting toward them, filling half the sky. The Hunters dismount. JAKE looks up at the beanstalk going into the clouds. He turns to Tsutey, who is checking the young hunters gear. JAKE We doin this? Jake leaps to catch up as Tsutey and the hunters swarm up the base of the beanstalk. CUT TO: . EXT. BEANSTALK DAY METERS up the BEANSTALK, the hunters nimbly climb along the vinetrunks. They clamber over one of the unobtanium BOULDERS which is lifting this incredible tree. JAKE looks down the massive trunk dwindles to the size of a licorice stick. A chunk breaks off a boulder as he climbs over it it floats upward. They reach the upper branches of the beanstalk. Above them, the craggy underbelly of MONS Veritatis looms. Spray from one of the waterfalls hits them. Some of the HANGING VINES are brushing over the upper branches of the beanstalk with a crackling hiss. One by one the hunters grab onto vines as they pass. Jake shrugs and leaps to a passing vine, his feet dangling over nothingness. They climb toward the floating islands above. EXT. MONS VERITATIS DAY TINY FIGURES cross a causeway of vines connecting a small island of unobtanium to the main mass of Mons Veritatis. WIDE SHOT looking down a rock face bigger than Half Dome the sheer side of Mons Veritatis. Banshees circle next to the cliffs, flashing in shafts of sunlight. Waterfalls dissolve into nothingness below. EXT. GROTTO/BANSHEE ROOKERY DAY A waterfall THUNDERS down into the void like a faucet of the gods. Jake looks down the sheer cliff at the world far below a view from Olympus. A SHRIEK and the THWAP THWAP of leathery wings NEYTIRIS BANSHEE swoops in to perch at the edge of the grotto. She dismounts and, like a falconer, covers its eyes with a woven HOOD. It waits, docile, as She joins Jake and the hunter party. Tsutey leads them through the cave until they emerge onto a CLIFF FACE. And Jake sees The BANSHEE ROOKERY. HUNDREDS of banshees huddle on rock out croppings as far as the eye can see. They cling to the walls with the foreclaws on their wings, or perch on ledges. . TSUTEY Jakesully will go first. Tsutey smirks at Jake, a challenge in his eyes. The two teenage Hunters are scared but trying to act tough. Tsutey scowls when Neytiri leads Jake out onto the ledge. NEYTIRI (whispering) Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside. If he also chooses you, move quick, like I showed. You will have one chance. JAKE How will I know if he chooses me? NEYTIRI He will try to kill you. JAKE Outstanding. Out of sight of Tsutey, Neytiri takes his hand and squeezes it. Jake feels a rush of emotion, but she breaks away like it didnt happen. He is on his own, on the ledge with The BANSHEES. They eye him as he approaches. Several SHRIEK and take flight. Others flap their wings and yawn, showing rows of fangs, in a threat display. Jake unrolls a weighted leather strap, like a oneended BOLO. A LARGE MALE spreads enormous wings, SHRIEKS, and glares straight at him. Jake looks directly into its eyes and strides toward it. JAKE Lets dance. The challenged banshee HISSES and leaps at him, jaws wide as Jake times the lunge, swinging the bolo, feinting and then slipping aside as the banshees jaws miss him, SNAPPING SHUT. Jake WHAPS the bolo across its snout. The weighted thong whips twice around its long jaws, tying them shut. A MUFFLED SCREAM and it SLASHES at his stomach with razor talons but . Jake is already leaping, over the talons and tackling the banshee around the neck. It topples on its side, and he SWARMS IT arms around its thrashing head. Jake grabs its whiplike antenna and brings it toward his queue but The bony head SLAMS sideways, and BAM! clocks him right in the face, almost knocking him out and IT WRITHES, flinging him to the ground. He slides on the rock and almost goes over the edge as NEYTIRI gasps. Tsutey laughs and yells mockingly. The bolo is coming loose as the creature shakes its head, way pissed off now, but Jake scrambles up and leaps straight at it. Claws rake his leg but he gets his arms around its head and CLAMPS DOWN HARD. They flop to the ground and he scrambles on top, pinning it and Grabs its whipping antenna, locks it under his arm, and jams the end of his queue into it. They FUSE together and The banshee stops struggling. It lies there panting. They are locked together, literally eye to eye. JAKE Thats right! Youre mine. ECU BANSHEE the pupil like a deep black well. Jake relaxes his grip and slowly, warily, slides his leg over the creatures back. Neytiri runs to him. NEYTIRI First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait. Jake sits astride the creature, feeling its power. He grips a hank of the beasts main, and JAKE Heeeyyyaaaah! THWAP! THWAP! The banshee is off like a shot. Jake SCREAMS as they PLUMMET off the cliff the banshee WAILS and . They fall together, spiralling out of control, and he is almost tossed lose. The thing is SQUAWKING and SHRIEKING so much he can't think. JAKE Shut the hell up!! It does. JAKE Level out! Fly straight! It levels out. Jake cocks his head, only thinking bank left and the animal complies. He settles the banshee into an easy loping beat of its huge wings, while he catches his breath. NEYTIRIS BANSHEE falls into formation with him. She signals follow me and DIVES. Jake guides his banshee clumsily after her. Neytiris banshee moves with precise movements of its wingtips, while Jakes wobbles and dips, almost falling out of the sky. THE CAMERA SWOOPS after them as Neytiri leads an arcing DIVE around the flank of Mons Veritatis. The scenery is stunning. They pass waterfalls and swoop between hanging vines. Neytiri leads Jake in a sharp bank, skimming close to the cliffs. They punch through streamers of cloud and emerge into sunlight. Jake is getting the hang of it. He jinks left, then right, then dives, tucking himself tight against the animals back. Hes reckless, fearless. Half in control and LOVING IT. Neytiri dives next to him as he lets out a long WHOOP of joy. CUT TO: INT./EXT. GROTTO/MONS VERITATIS DAY FLIGHT MONTAGE: NEYTIRI squats with Jake, using her hands to explain flight principles like one fighter pilot to another. LOOKING DOWN a sheer cliff. SWOOOSH! Jake and Neytiri dive their mounts STRAIGHT DOWN PAST CAMERA, pulling out and soaring into a series of aerobatic turns. JAKE (V.O.) I may not be much of a horse guy. But I was born to do this. . THEY FLY in close formation with TSUTEY and the young HUNTERS, banshees flashing through scarves of mist. ANOTHER DAY. Jake dives, playing hide and seek with Neytiri among the clouds. They are wild and free in a wild world. She grins and banks hard, diving catch me if you can. He DIVES after her. IN THE GROTTO, by firelight, JAKES BANSHEE snaps at a piece of meat which he playfully pulls back. Hes teaching it to take the food more slowly. He strokes its long head. TSUTEY is nearby with the young hunters. He eyes Jake with frustrated hostility. ANOTHER DAY Jake and Neytiri fly abreast, soaring easily. She points and Jake sees A BIZARRE GEOLOGICAL FORMATION. Arches of magnetic rock form rainbows of stone above a deep CALDERA. In the center of the caldera is a single, enormous WILLOW TREE, gnarled and ancient. This, we will be told, is THE WELL OF SOULS. CUT TO: EXT. RIDGE JAKE flies with Neytiri along a forested ridge. She is teaching him to hunt from his banshee. They carry their bows at the ready, scanning below them for prey. A HUGE SHADOW covers him and Neytiri SHOUTS a warning. Jake looks up to see A LEONOPTERYX in a deltadive, whistling straight at him. Like a banshee, only several times larger, it is the king predator of the air: the GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Striped scarlet, yellow and black, with a midnight blue crested head it is both gorgeous and terrifying. The hunter has become the prey. JAKE snaprolls and dives toward the forest canopy. He plummets into the gloom as KCRASH the leonopteryx tears through foliage, following him down, both diving like missiles and JAKE yanks into a hairpin bank, right through a gap between two huge branches Forcing the leonopteryx to brake with a loud FWOOSH of wings. It banks away with a frustrated SHRIEK. Two flaps of its mighty wings and it is gone, back above the canopy. . CLOSE ON THE LEONOPTERYX, as its fanged mouth opens in a bloodcurdling SCREECH which echoes among the mountains. The lord of its domain. ON JAKE, shaken. Neytiri flies up, her expression the Navi equivalent of Oh my God. A beat they both crack up. CUT TO: INT. SHACK NIGHT Jake ponders images Grace has called up at her workstation science graphics of the Leonopteryx. Trudy and Norm are crowded around as well. GRACE The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial predator. Not only rare, but the sightings tend not to get reported. Trudy makes a clicking motion with her thumb. TRUDY There usually isnt time to key the mike. JAKE The People call it Toruk. NORM (translating) Last Shadow. JAKE Last one you ever see. TRUDY I saw one take out a gunship once WHAM! Total frickin yard sale. Ate the crew like peanuts. TIME CUT Grace is scanning through images and Jake stops her on one a D aerial shot of the strange arched formation. JAKE Thats it. GRACE Vitraya Ramunong The Well of Souls. Its their most sacred place. She moves the virtual camera, and we seem to fly around the Well of Souls, catching only a glimpse of the interior. . GRACE Something big is going on in there, biologically. Id die to get samples, but outsiders are strictly forbidden. TIME CUT Jake looks through the pressure window at HUMAN GRACE and NORM outside. Wearing masks, they are taking readings from some timeseries experiments Grace has set up. As TRUDY watches, JAKE works fast to download Graces images of the Well of Souls onto a memory chip. TRUDY Theyre coming back. Jake pulls the chip, then hesitates. Torn by what he is doing. TRUDY If you dont give him something, hes gonna shut us down. He hands her the chip and she slips it into a pocket of her flightsuit just as Grace and Norm enter from the airlock. JAKE Hey, guys. CUT TO: INT. HOMETREE NIGHT JAKE STARES up at the TOTEM SKULL, which we now recognize as that of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX. NEYTIRI watches as he reaches up to touch the tall indigo crest. NEYTIRI My grandfathers grandfather was Toruk Macto Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk chose him. It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs. JAKE Thats a long time. Neytiri takes his hand, because thats what the Navi do when theyre telling you something important. NEYTIRI Toruk Macto was mighty he brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow. All Navi people know this story. . PUSH IN SLOWLY on the skull totem, then CUT TO: EXT. RIVER BED DAY JAKE, NEYTIRI and other FLYING HUNTERS swoop low above a HERD OF STURMBEEST a rapids of thundering muscle. Dust rises from this living river like steam from a python's back. TRACKING WITH the herd. A HUNTER appears in FG, astride a direhorse at full gallop. The sight is breathtaking. He hurls a meter spear and one of the sturmbeest CRASHES down, flipping twice from momentum. JAKE ROLLS IN like a fighter jet, his banshee screaming. He draws and fires his bow. The arrow strikes true, in the plexus between the armored shoulders and THE BEAST crashes to the ground. Skids to a stop in a cloud of dust. NEYTIRI swoops in next to Jake, arms raised and grinning wolfishly. CU TSUTEY, banking around Jakes kill. Jake looks up, and Tsutey SALUTES in grudging admiration. CUT TO: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE NIGHT The central space is lit by a BONFIRE, around which the HUNT FESTIVAL is in full swing. Wild dancing. People gnawing on massive sturmbeest ribs. A bowl of some kavalike intoxicant is passed around. NEYTIRI dances in a flowing costume as the BANSHEE SPIRIT. NORM is dancing seductively with his own tail. JAKE, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands. The leaping firelight plays across the eye sockets of the TORUK SKULL, bringing it to life. It seems to watch Jake. TSUTEY squats next to Jake, the usual scowl on his face. Jake braces himself and Tsutey holds up the KAVA BOWL, offering it to him. A challenge or an olive branch? Jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm. . GRACE Watch that stuff. Itll knock you into next week. Jake offers the bowl back to Tsutey. They lock eyes. Tsutey drinks. LATER AN EMPTY BOWL drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire. WIDER ON JAKE and TSUTEY, sitting amid the rowdy hunters. Tsutey looks a little blearily at Jake. Finally, he GRINS. TSUTEY I thought enough drink you would not be so ugly. JAKE Sorry. Tsutey looks deep into the fire. TSUTEY Your warriors hide inside machines fight from far away. (he looks at Jake) I did not think a sky person could be brave. Before Jake can answer, NEYTIRIS lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. She takes Jake by the hand and pulls him up NEYTIRI You must dance! It is the way. TSUTEY watches as she leads him away, his face darkening the moment of connection to Jake lost to anger. The hunters WHOOP and CHEER as Jake joins the circle of dancers. Jake takes Graces hand and pulls her up, protesting. JAKE lets the DRUMS and CHANTING flow through him. He lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy. GRACE is rocking out, grinning. We see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her. Jake and Neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other. . A couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them. Mo'at and EYTUKAN follow their look, seeing the obvious connection. MOAT (subtitled) We cannot let this seed grow. Her path is with Tsutey. ON JAKE, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked with Neytiri. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DAY WIDE VISTA mist blowing through the treetops as the morning sun burns it away. A spectacular panorama of a vast, primeval land. UP ANGLE TRACKING among the trees, the sunlight shafting down like light in a cathedral. JAKE (V.O.) Its hard to put in words the deep connection the People have to the forest. HIGH IN THE BRANCHES of a tree, Jake watches as Neytiri gently bends a large pitcherlike flower toward her, sipping nectar which is sweet and thick as honey. An incredibly sensuous image. JAKE (V.O.) They see a network of energy that flows through all living things. They know that all energy is only borrowed MACRO SHOT of a purple flower, beaded with raindrops. A blue hand picks the flower. JAKE (V.O.) and one day you have to give it back. LOOKING DOWN into a hole dug among tree roots. The body of an old Omaticaya WOMAN lies curled there like an unborn baby in the womb of the earth. The purple flower is gently placed on her body, joining flowers, totems and beads. Mo'at recites a prayer as Neytiri, acting as acolyte, places a WOODSPRITE, a seed of the Great Tree, on the body. Earth is poured over the LENS and we CUT TO . JAKE WAKING UP in the Link. DARK as a coffin. He pushes the lid off, letting in light, and lies there. He looks pale and haggard, with a scraggly beard. JAKE (V.O.) Hard to believe its only been three months. JAKE SITS in front of the video log camera, late at night. It is many log entries later. He has lost a lot of weight. He looks like a junkie watching a test pattern. JAKE (to the lens) I can barely remember my old life. Im not sure who I am anymore. CUT TO: EXT. COMPOUND DAY Under a sky of thunderheads, the forest is a dark wall beyond the fence. SELFRIDGE, wearing an exopack, TEES UP while GRACE and JAKE approach from the direction of the Ops Center. SELFRIDGE Good of you to stop by. Hows it going out there? Our blue friends all packed up yet? Selfridge swings his DRIVER with good form. SELFRIDGE See, I keep hooking it. Its the damn pack. THE BALL drops into the mud just past a marker which reads . A TROOPER walks over to retrieve it. SELFRIDGE The low gravity and the high air density cancel out so JAKE You called us back to report you want to hear it or not? SELFRIDGE Go ahead. GRACE Jake is making incredible progress, years worth in just a few months. But we need more time. . SELFRIDGE Not what I was hoping to hear. It starts to rain. Selfridge calmly pulls an umbrella from his golf bag and snaps it open. GRACE Parker, its their ancestral home. Theyve lived there since before human history began. You can spare them a few more weeks. SELFRIDGE This thing is inevitable. What does it matter when it happens? Im sorry, Dr. Augustine. Youre out of time. He leaves them standing there to get drenched. CUT TO: INT. ARMOR BAY A break table, under a harsh overhead light. Quaritch pulls up a chair, turns it around, and sits astride it facing Jake. He studies Jakes pale, sunken face. The scraggly beard. QUARITCH Youre not gettin lost in the woods, are you son? Jake cant meet his eyes. QUARITCH Your last report was two weeks ago. Im starting to doubt your resolve. From what I see, its time to terminate this mission. Jake eyes flare with alarm. JAKE No. I can do this. QUARITCH Look, youve given me plenty of usable intel. Like this Well of Souls place Ive got them by the balls with that, when it turns into a shitfight. Which it will. Jake feels hollow inside, knowing what hes done. . QUARITCH So youll get your legs back, like I promised. (puts his hand on Jakes shoulder) Its time to come in. Jake ponders this. Isnt this what he was doing all this for? JAKE Ive gotta finish this thing. Theres one more test the Dream Hunt. Its the final stage of becoming a man. Then Im one of them. Theyll trust what I say... Its hard for him to even form these words JAKE ... and I can negotiate the terms of their relocation. QUARITCH Then you need to get it done, Corporal. CUT TO: EXT. HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS NIGHT Strange horizontal LIGHTNING branches through the floating mountains, twisted by the magnetic fields. The sky is black and heavy with clouds. INT. SHACK KITCHEN NIGHT Jake is gulping black coffee like a tequila shot, looking pretty STRUNG OUT. GRACE is smoking furiously. GRACE Jake, I cant allow this. Youre just not strong enough. JAKE Its the last door Im going through it. You can help me or get out of the way. Jake pushes past her toward the corridor GRACE (grabbing him) Will you listen to me? Sometimes the Navi themselves die in these vision quests. The venom takes you to the edge of death. . (MORE) And the psychoactive alkaloid in the worm we have no idea what thatll do in an avatar brain. Jake breaks free and wheels away, down the corridor. GRACE follows JAKE as he crosses to the Link. A sheet of LIGHTNING flashes across the sky outside. Norm is initializing the Link. NORM Calibrating. Thirty seconds. She puts her hands on his shoulders. GRACE No matter what you prove out there you are still in here. (shaking him) Right here. JAKE I have to go all the way become one of them GRACE (furiously) Goddammit, Jake, you can never be one of them! Norm looks up, startled at the VEHEMENCE in GRACE voice. GRACE Our life out there takes millions of dollars of machinery to sustain. You visit and you leave. During this, Jake pulls himself from his wheelchair, levering himself into the Link, hauling his useless legs inside. GRACE (softening) You can never truly be with her. Jake stops, pinioned by the truth. He seems suddenly very lost. JAKE You know why Im here? Because Quaritch sent me. NORM What? . GRACE (cont'd) JAKE Thats right to embed with the Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them out of their home. By deceit or by force, he didnt care. And if it turned out to be force, then how best to do it. Norm is in shock. But Grace is eerily calm. GRACE And what about now, Jake? JAKE Im not that guy any more. Grace nods. Shes been on his journey every step of the way. GRACE I know. JAKE But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he yanks me out I never see her again. And if I tell her the truth, the clan throws me out thats if they dont cut my heart out and show it to me. Jake looks hopelessly at the two of them. In his own perfect Hell. NORM They wont understand what youve done. JAKE They dont even have a word for lie they had to learn it from us. Grace sees he is on the verge of tears. Lost and alone, between worlds. GRACE I know. I taught it to them. JAKE (pleading) Grace. Ive gotta go. Theyre waiting. NORM Link is ready. Grace stops him as he tries to close the lid. . GRACE Jake. You cant carry this burden much longer. JAKE (smiling wanly) Its okay. Moat says an alien mind probably cant survive the Dream Hunt anyway. Grace closes the lid. It feels like closing a coffin. She watches his psionic patterns aligning to his avatar, somewhere out in the night. GRACE (to Norm) Prep my link. Im going in. CUT TO: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE NIGHT JAKE SITS, eyes closed, as Neytiri and another young hunter paint his face and body in preparation for uniltaron the Dream Hunt. NEYTIRI When your Spirit Animal comes, you will know. Their eyes meet with emotion neither can conceal any longer. TIME CUT. GRACE stands with the crowd at the ramp to HOMETREES LOWEST LEVEL. Jake barely sees her as he goes down the spiral. She tries to follow, but is barred by a hunter. BELOW, seemingly in the womb of the earth, Jake walks slowly into the center of a tight circle of seated elders and hunters. An ELDER is slowly rapping a large WATER DRUM. TIME CUT MOAT purifies him with smoke from burning herbs, CHANTING in a low monotone. Jake, squatting, washes the smoke over himself with his palms. MACRO MOATS FINGERS unwrap a piece of wood riddled with holes. She catches the end of a glowing purple WORM, and draws it out of the wood. MO'AT (subtitled) Oh wise worm, eater of the Sacred Tree bless this worthy Hunter with a true vision. . MOAT places the worm on Jakes outstretched TONGUE. It twists on itself, lighting his mouth before he closes it. She indicates he should chew. He does. MACRO AN EARTHEN JAR is opened. EYTUKAN removes a writhing black ARACHNOID, the Pandoran equivalent of a scorpion. He places it against the back of Jakes neck and presses. The insect drives its stinger into Jakes skin and Jake grimaces. Mo'at and Eytukan step back, leaving Jake alone in the circle. Neytiri watches intently, joining in the low chant. SLOW DOLLY IN on Jake. His eyes OPEN. He looks around at the faces they seem to TRANSFORM, becoming threatening. Jake looks down at the palms of his hands. JAKES POV his hands recede, his whole body, the ground and INSTANTLY the circle of Navi recedes, as if to a distant horizon, leaving vast ground in between. SPACE is utterly distorted, and SOUND as well echoing, THUNDEROUS. ECU JAKE pupils DILATED black. He looks around and The onlookers are gone, replaced by a ring of glowing trees, which seem miles high. The whole image is bathed in spectral radiance. Jake looks down JAKES POV his body and hands transforming fingers stretching into tendrils, legs becoming roots which spread outward across the ground, a thousand glowing dendrites which connect to the roots of the trees and CUT TO REALITY Jake is on his hands and knees, PUKING in the dirt. He contorts, crying out in agony as the venom contracts his muscles but IN HIS VISION Jake stands serene on a FLOATING MOUNTAIN CLIFF. A GREAT BLACK SHADOW covers him, the unmistakable X silhouette of a diving LEONOPTERYX. The LAST SHADOW. CAMERA SCREAMS down on him as the shadow grows larger WE RUSH into his face, into the blackness of his pupil which FILLS THE UNIVERSE and . REAL JAKE writhes in the dirt, his back arched as his muscles seize. He foams and thrashes, his eyes rolled back in his head, while inside TIME ITSELF HAS ACCELERATED clouds scream around the mountain tops, mist boils through the forest. He feels the wind of time blowing through him as REAL JAKE claws the ground, moaning, staring blindly while INSIDE, IN POV he FLIES over the landscape of Pandora but the forest is BLASTED. Fires flicker among trees that are BURNED black and lifeless in a smoky twilight. A great WINGED SHADOW is cast below, rippling over the devastated ground. AVATAR JAKE looks down at the shadow. Realizes HE is casting it, and we RUSH IN to his PUPIL and PULL BACK from the eye of a GREAT LEONOPTERYX, flying lordly and terrible over the land. It lets out an almighty SHRIEK which seems to echo to eternity and SLAM CUT to Jake, on his back, GASPING back in his body. He weakly rolls up to one elbow and looks around the room. MO'AT It is finished. Neytiris face is flooded with relief. The faces of the clan elders look at Jake expectantly. EYTUKAN (subtitled) Did your Spirit Animal come? Jake looks from Eytukan to Mo'at, Tsutey and the elders. How can he tell them what he has seen? Moat puts her splayed fingers against his face, seeming to peer into his troubled soul. MO'AT (to Jake) Something has come. (to the others, subtitled) It will take time for the meaning to be clear. She steps back, and Eytukan motions for Jake to stand. He gets up, weakly. . OUTSIDE THE ENCLOSURE Eytukan emerges with Jake and the others. The entire clan is gathered, waiting to hear what has happened. Jake looks up at the Leonopteryx Skull Totem, which seems to stare down at him. GRACE watches, her eyes brimming. Proud. Relieved. Amazed. Eytukan places both hands on Jakes chest and holds them there. EYTUKAN (subtitled) You are now a son of the Omaticaya. You are part of the People. All the members of the clan press forward, crowding around and putting their hands on Jakes shoulders, back, chest hands upon hands, until he is connected to everyone. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. RAINFOREST NIGHT JAKE and NEYTIRI run silhouetted in the night. Behind them waterfalls cascade down in the silvery light. POLYPHEMUS RISES behind the trees. NEYTIRI DIVES from a rock, slicing into a mirror of water. Jake follows her and UNDERWATER, they swim over glowing ANEMONES. They seem to float in a cosmic dance above a luminous garden of waving shapes. Tiny purple fish swirl around them. Their hands come together, fingers twining, as they float weightlessly, as if between worlds. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. WILLOW GLADE Laughing, they run together into a stand of WILLOWS. Their trunks are as gnarled as bonsai. Long faintly glowing tendrils hang straight down in pastel curtains. Underfoot, a bed of moss glows faintly. It REACTS to their footsteps with expanding rings of light. It is an exquisitely beautiful spot. The willows stir, responding to their presence. She holds up her hands, letting the TENDRILS caress her. . NEYTIRI This is a place for prayers to be heard. And sometimes answered. Jake puts out his hands and the tendrils play over his fingers, his palms, his forearms. His eyes go wide. We hear the WHISPERING of ancient Navi VOICES. JAKE Its like a sound you feel. NEYTIRI We call this utraya mokri the Tree of Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who live within Eywa. A few WOODSPRITES circle around them, some alighting on their shoulders and arms. They stand, very close together now. Her eyes are intense, almost luminous. He feels drawn into them. But she pulls back a little. NEYTIRI You are Omaticaya now. You may make your own bow from the wood of Hometree. (she looks away) And you may choose a woman. The Amazon warrior trying so hard to sound casual. Jake suppresses a smile. NEYTIRI We have many fine women. Ninat is the best singer JAKE I dont want Ninat. NEYTIRI There is Beyral she is a good hunter Jake puts his fingers on her lips to stop her. JAKE Ive already chosen. But this woman must also choose me. She takes his hands and their fingers intertwine, moving gently over each other. . NEYTIRI She already has. He puts his face close to hers. She rubs her cheek against his. He kisses her on the mouth. They explore each other. Then she pulls back, eyes sparkling. NEYTIRI Kissing is very good. But we have something better. She pulls him down until they are kneeling, facing each other on the faintly glowing moss. Neytiri takes the end of her queue and raises it. Jake does the same, with trembling anticipation. The tendrils at the ends move with a life of their own, straining to be joined. MACRO SHOT The tendrils INTERTWINE with gentle undulations. JAKE rocks with the direct contact between his nervous system and hers. The ultimate intimacy. They come together into a kiss and sink down on the bed of moss, and ripples of light spread out around them. THE WILLOWS sway, without wind, and the night is alive with pulsing energy as we DISSOLVE TO LATER. She is collapsed across his chest. Spent. He strokes her face tenderly. JAKE Neytiri, you know my real body is far away, sleeping. She raises up, placing her fingertips to his chest NEYTIRI This body is real. (she touches his forehead) This spirit is real. Her eyes are luminous, honest, infinitely deep. NEYTIRI When I was first your teacher, I hated all Sky People. But you have also taught me. (whispering) Spirit is all that matters. . She lays her head down, against his chest, listening to his heartbeat. NEYTIRI I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for life. JAKE We are? NEYTIRI Yes. It is our way. (innocently) Oh. I forgot to tell? He rouses up, making her look at him. JAKE Really, we are? NEYTIRI We are. Jake considers this. JAKE Its cool. Im there. He lays his head down, and her arms enfold him, sheltering him as he sleeps. INT. SHACK NIGHT Jakes eyes open in the darkness. He just lies there, thinking. In his coffin. In another world. CUT TO: EXT. WILLOW GLADE DAWN DAWN BREAKS in the sacred glade. Shafts of orange morning light. Jake and Neytiri asleep in each others' arms. Maxfield Parrish painting. But then THE ROAR OF ENGINES. Neytiri awakens with a start. The SPLINTERING, CRACKLING of forest being crushed under enormous treads gets louder. SHE WATCHES in growing horror as the BLADE of a bulldozer becomes a dark wall behind the sheltering ring of willows. She shakes Jake, shouting at him in Navi to wake up. . NEYTIRI Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come back to me now. Jake! INT. SHACK DAWN HUMAN JAKE is in a hurry to get back to the link. GRACE, still groggy, chases him with coffee and microwaved eggs. GRACE Here eat this. Id hate to have to forcefeed a cripple. She slams the lid shut before he can enter and sticks the plate under his nose. GRACE (grinning) Shes not going anywhere. He sighs heavily and starts wolfing the eggs. EXT. WILLOW GLADE DAWN Neytiri SCREAMS as The willows begin to fall before the blade, to be ground under the treads. AVATAR JAKE is directly in the path. She tries to lift him, but he is too heavy. She is screaming at him, frantically trying to wake him, as INT. SHACK DAWN Jake adjusts himself in the link chair. He hands Grace the empty plate. GRACE And when was the last time you took a shower? Jesus, Marine. Jake pushes her hands away and pulls the lid down. EXT. WILLOW GLADE AVATAR JAKE wakes up to see NEYTIRI dragging him, screaming. He leaps up as THE DOZER pushes inexorably into the glade, splintering the trees, plowing the earth before it. JAKE RUNS into the path of the bulldozer, waving his arms. . JAKE Hey! Heeeey! Stop! Stop! He positions himself where the cameraeyes of the robotic juggernaut will see him. INT. OPS CENTER DAY CLOSE ON MONITOR Jake shouts but theres no sound feed. WIDER as the TRACTOR OPERATOR sees him and pulls back on the remote throttles. He yells to his SUPERVISOR. OPERATOR Hey, I got one of the natives blockin my blade here. This attracts the attention of Selfridge, who comes over to the workstation. ON THE SCREEN Jake, in his Omaticaya loincloth and ceremonial body paint, is unrecognizable. SUPERVISOR (to Selfridge) What do we do? SELFRIDGE Roll on. Hell move. These people have to learn that we dont stop. TIGHT ON THROTTLES as the operator pushes them forward. ON THE SCREEN Jake stumbles back, tripping, disappears below the blade for a second reappears, running to the side. EXT. WILLOW GLADE JAKE grabs a rock and LEAPS onto the dozer. He climbs quickly to the CAMERA MAST. SMASH! The rock crashes into the lens of the camera. Jake beats the rock furiously against it, pounding it to junk. INT. OPS CENTER CLOSE ON MONITOR as Jakes demonic face is replaced by noise. OPERATOR Im blind. He pulls back on the throttles. . EXT. WILLOW GLADE THE JUGGERNAUT grinds to a stop. But the ROAR of engines continues because MORE DOZERS and TRACTORS advance nearby, crushing the forest before them. Trees are slashed down by the PLASMA CUTTERS. Terrified animals flee before the onslaught. POWERSUITS and TROOPERS stride through the ravaged forest, blasting anything that moves. A trooper sees Jake on the dozer. He rips off a BURST and Rounds CLANG into metal as Jake dives off the machine. He grabs Neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. From behind a screen of leaves, they watch as THE DOZERS advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving only mud and wood splinters in their path. CU NEYTIRI, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable wrongness of it. She sobs as the willows die. INT. OPS CENTER MINUTES LATER, the operator is playing back the CAMERAS FEED for Quaritch and the others. QUARITCH Freeze it, right there. ON MONITOR the image expands, until Jakes face is clear, frozen in an animal snarl. SELFRIDGE Son of a bitch! PUSH IN ON QUARITCH as his jaw clenches in cold fury. He turns and strides toward the door, shouting to his WATCH COMMANDER as he passes. QUARITCH Get me a pilot! CUT TO: INT. COMMONS/HOMETREE DAY A RAIDING PARTY of hunters, their bodies painted, raise weapons overhead. AVATAR GRACE watches with growing alarm. . EYTUKAN (subtitled) Tsutey will lead the war party! Tsutey steps forward, face full of hate, raising a war cry among the hunters. GRACE (subtitled) Please this will only make it worse TSUTEY You do not speak here! JAKE and NEYTIRI cross the commons toward them. Jake feels all eyes turn toward him. He takes her arm, stopping her. JAKE (to Neytiri, low) Okay, listen. Theres something I have to tell you. Its gonna be hard. I just need you to He sees TSUTEY striding toward them, his face a mask of fury. TSUTEY You! Tsutey walks right up and SLAMS Jake in the chest with both hands. It is so unexpected, that Jake topples on his ass. TSUTEY You mated with this woman?! GRACE Oh shit. Jake stands. He reaches out for Neytiri. She goes to him, clutching his hand. MO'AT Is this true? NEYTIRI (subtitled) We are mated before Eywa. It is done. Tsutey turns to Mo'at and Eytukan, his face anguished. . TSUTEY (subtitled) Neytiri was promised to me! Everything is changing. Everything is being destroyed! Tsutey points at Jake, his pain shifting to rage. TSUTEY (subtitled) These aliens kill everything they touch, like poison. MO'AT Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can never be Tsahik. Your life will be wasted. Neytiri looks at her mother sees the grief in her eyes. NEYTIRI I have chosen. Tsutey draws his knife and TSUTEY Yeeeeeaaa! LUNGES AT JAKE, whos ready this time he sidesteps, blocking the knife, and elbows Tsutey HARD in the face. Tsutey reels back, nose bleeding. He starts forward on a second attack but Eytukan grabs his arm and spins him around. EYTUKAN (subtitled) Stop! This is not a proper challenge. Tsutey glares at Jake while sheathing his knife. TSUTEY I challenge you. GRACE Jake, dont JAKE I accept. CUT TO: . INT./EXT. SAMSON DAY QUARITCH rides left seat as Trudy pilots through the mountains. She glances at him, then toggles the aircom. TRUDY Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch with me and But Quaritch SLAMS the switch, cutting her off. QUARITCH Did I tell you to announce us? TRUDY Sorry sir, its procedure. INT. SHACK Norm punches buttons on the comms console. NORM Samson One Six? Trudy? (no answer) Crap. He looks helplessly at Jake and Graces link units no way to warn them. INT. HOMETREE DAY TSUTEY AND JAKE square off. Each holds a long, solid staff. The entire clan crowds around them in a circle. GRACE What the hell are you doing? JAKE Its the only way to get him to goddamn listen. TSUTEY LEAPS at Jake with a sharp cry and Jake parries with his staff. The staves CLACK off each other as the two combatants LEAP, DUCK and STRIKE furiously. Tsutey sweeps Jake off his feet with a roundhouse hit to the ankles, but Jake ROLLS out of it and catches Tsutey in the belly with the blunt end. . EXT. SITE DAY TRUDYS SAMSON lands. QUARITCH and a posse of troopers jump down and rush the Shack. INT. COMMONS TSUTEY wades in with a series of short, sharp blows. Jake swings with equal fury. Both fighting from the heart. The staves whistle through the air, and CLACK together like gunshots. Jake presses hard, and Tsutey staggers back, stumbling as Jake lands a SOLID HIT, dropping him to his knees, just as INT. SHACK THE INNER DOOR bangs open and QUARITCH stomps toward Graces Link controls. NORM Hey, hang on, you cant interrupt a link in progress, its dangerous wait! Quaritch shoves him aside and SMACKS his fist down on the POWER switch. Graces unit goes dead and INT. COMMONS AVATAR GRACES eyes roll back and she keels over. NEYTIRI barely catches her before she hits the ground. JAKE parries as Tsutey swings but then Jake's eyes go blank just as KRACK! Tsutey puts one alongside his head. Jake sprawls, completely inert. Tsutey pokes him with his staff, then raises it and lets out a piercing VICTORY CRY. INT. SHACK DAY JAKE SLAMS OPEN the Link, amped from the fight, furious JAKE Are you out of your goddamn mind?! QUARITCH You crossed a line. Quaritch PUNCHES HIM HARD. Jake flops back, dazed. The troopers yank him out and ZIPTIE his wrists. . INT. COMMONS TSUTEY draws his KNIFE, and bends down, grabbing Jake by the hair. TSUTEY (subtitled) This is a demon in a false body. It should not live. He puts his knife to Jakes throat but NEYTIRI BLINDSIDES him at full tilt. Tsutey sprawls, rolls, comes up to see Neytiri crouched like a lioness over Jake, her KNIFE and teeth bared, her ears flattened. She SNARLS with primal fury. Tsutey stands panting. He pushes through the crowd and walks away, calling for his hunters. CUT TO: INT. OPS CENTER DUSK TIGHT ON MONITOR showing JAKES AVATAR FACE on the dozer camera, as he pounds a rock into the lens. The shot FREEZES on Jakes ANIMAL SNARL. WIDER HUMAN JAKE sits, bruised and bleeding, watching himself on the monitor. GRACE and NORM stand nearby, rubbing their wrists where the zipties bit in. SELFRIDGE and QUARITCH watch with disdain. QUARITCH You let me down, son. You got a little local pussy and completely forgot what team you play for. Jake meets his gaze with a defiant glare. GRACE Parker, listen, there may still be time to QUARITCH Shut your fucking hole! Grace is momentarily stunned by Quaritchs fury. But she meets it with her own intensity, not backing down an inch. . GRACE Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me? (to Selfridge) You need to muzzle your dog! SELFRIDGE Can we just take this down a couple notches, please. JAKE (to Quaritch) You say you want to keep your people alive. Start by listening to her. Jake nods to Grace to continue. GRACE (to Selfridge) This is bad, Parker. Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you cant imagine. SELFRIDGE You know what? You throw a stick in the air around here it falls on some sacred fern. GRACE Im not talking about pagan voodoo here Im talking about something real and measurable in the biology of the forest. SELFRIDGE (frustrated) Which is what exactly? Graces nerve fails. A rush of conflicting emotions the need to act, to do something, colliding with her scientific rigor. GRACE (to Jake) I cant do this. How am I supposed to reduce years of work to a sound bite for the illiterate? JAKE Just tell him what you know in your heart. She turns to Parker, steeling herself. . GRACE Alright, look I dont have the answers yet, Im just now starting to even frame the questions. What we think we know is that theres some kind of electrochemical communication between the roots of the trees. Like the synapses between neurons. Each tree has ten to the fourth connections to the trees around it, and there are ten to the twelfth trees on Pandora SELFRIDGE Thats a lot Im guessing. GRACE Thats more connections than the human brain. You get it? Its a network a global network. And the Navi can access it they can upload and download data memories at sites like the one you destroyed. SELFRIDGE What the hell have you people been smoking out there? Theyre just. Goddamn. Trees. GRACE You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth of this world isnt in the ground its all around us. The Navi know that, and theyre fighting to defend it. If you want to share this world with them, you need to understand them. QUARITCH We understand them just fine. Thanks to Jake here. Jake shares a look of alarm with Grace as Quaritch selects a NEW CLIP on the main monitor TIGHT ON MONITOR VIDEOLOG IMAGE of Jake, looking haggard and borderline deranged, rambling in a latenight monologue. JAKE (RECORDED) Theyre not going to give up their home theyre not gonna make a deal. For what? Lite beer and shopping channel? Theres nothing we have that they want. Were a horror to them. Were the monsters from space. . JAKE watches with a growing dread as his words condemn the people he has grown to love. JAKE (RECORDED) Theyre never going to leave Hometree. Quaritch FREEZES the recording. QUARITCH Since a deal cant be made it gets real simple. (to Jake, icily) So thanks. Im getting all emotional. I might just give you a big wet kiss. GRACE Parker, we have to talk, like rational people. SELFRIDGE Well, Id cherish that, but unfortunately youre out of here on the next shuttle. All of you.

Silhouettes of direhorse riders cross in SLOW MOTION, spears and bows held high. INT. OPS CENTER MORNING MONITOR SCREEN IMAGE WAINFLEET pans a camera across the smoldering hulks of BURNED DOZERS. The toppled remains of a charred ampsuit. Dead troopers bristling with arrows. WAINFLEET They hit with banshees first. Set the ampsuit on fire. Drivers toast. Quaritch and Selfridge look on grimly. QUARITCH The rest of the squad? WAINFLEET Six bodies thats all of em. And the equipment is totalled. SELFRIDGE Christ. . INT. SELFRIDGES OFFICE DAY Selfridge is stares soberly as Quaritch outlines the plan. QUARITCH I can do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous. Well clear them out with gas first. Itll be humane. More or less. Selfridge sighs and rubs his face. QUARITCH Hey, dont go limp on me now. This is exactly the incident we needed. SELFRIDGE Alright, lets pull the trigger. CUT TO: INT. BIO LAB MAX and the lab staff are glumly packing files and equipment, under the watchful eye of armed SECOPS TROOPERS. JAKE, GRACE, NORM stare bleakly at each other. GRACE They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose, to trigger a response. Theyre fabricating this war to get what they want. NORM I cant believe that. JAKE Yup. Thats how its done. When people are sitting on shit you want, you make them your enemy. Then youre justified in taking it. TRUDY RUNS into the lab, breathless. Shes wearing full flight gear and carrying her helmet. TRUDY Secops is rolling the gunships. Theyre gonna hit Hometree! JAKE When? TRUDY Now. Were spooling up now! I gotta go. . GRACE My God. Jake pumps furiously toward the door, Grace following. INT. OPS CENTER DAY SELFRIDGE surveys the airfield, where crews swarm over the gunships, loading ordnance. He turns as JAKE and GRACE charge toward him. GRACE Parker, wait. Stop! These are people youre about to SELFRIDGE Theyre flybitten savages who live in a tree! Look around I dont know about you but I see a lot of trees. They can move. GRACE For Gods sake, there are children in there. Babies! JAKE Look Selfridge, you dont want this kind of blood on your hands. Let me try to talk them out. They trust me. ON SELFRIDGE, considering this. CUT TO: INT. LINK ROOM SELFRIDGE and an escort of armed TROOPERS accompany Jake and Grace to the links. The two enter their units, as NORM and MAX prep the system. SELFRIDGE Youve got one hour. Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the axe comes down, you get them to evacuate. One hour. Jake lowers the upper clamshell. Norm starts the sequence. CUT TO: INT. COMMONS DAY The entire clan is gathered, with Eytukan and Mo'at presiding. Jake looks around, feeling the gaze of the People upon him. He steels himself, and speaks in clear Navi . JAKE (subtitled) Eytukan, I have something to say, to everyone. EYTUKAN (subtitled) Speak, Jakesully. JAKE (subtitled) A great evil is upon us. The Sky People are coming to destroy Hometree. They will be here soon. A murmur of fear and anger goes through the crowd. JAKE (subtitled) You have to leave, or you will die. MO'AT Are you certain of this? JAKE They sent me here to learn your ways. So one day I could bring this message, and you would believe it. NEYTIRI What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen? He is unable to meet her eyes. JAKE Yes. (anguished) At first it was just orders. Then everything changed. I fell in love with the forest, with the Omaticaya People (he looks at her) with you. And by then, how could I tell you? Neytiri can barely breathe. She is shaking with the enormity of it, her voice cracking with rage and pain NEYTIRI I trusted you, Jake! . JAKE Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to NEYTIRI You will never be one of the People! NEVER! TSUTEY yells to his HUNTERS TSUTEY (subtitled) Bind them. They grab Jake, who doesnt resist. Others seize Grace. Both are driven to their knees, and their arms bound. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DAY SCORPION GUNSHIPS darken the sky as they come over the tops of the trees. At the head of the formation is one much larger ship, a monster feet long the GENERAL DYNAMICS C DRAGON GUNSHIP. Quaritch, next to the pilot of the Dragon, surveys the world below like Napoleon astride his horse. EXT. HOMETREE JAKE and GRACE are lashed to posts at the front entrance to Hometree. The People look up as THE DRAGON and its escort of GUNSHIPS arrive over the trees. The DOWNBLAST from their rotors creates a maelstrom of flying leaves and debris. IN THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches a targeting screen a telescopic image of Jake and Grace tied to posts. QUARITCH Well, Id say diplomacy has failed. TSUTEY and another HUNTER hold knives to the throats of the two avatars, glaring defiantly at the gunships. QUARITCH I think they mean to cut their throats if we dont back off. Make sure you get a nice closeup of that. I can tack it onto the afteraction report. JAKE YELLS to Neytiri, Tsutey, the others gathered nearby . JAKE You have to get out of Hometree! Run to the forest! Please, Im begging you! EYTUKAN scowls at Jake, then GRABS TSUTEY and yells EYTUKAN (subtitled) Take the ikran! Attack from above! Tsutey grabs some hunters and runs up the roots of Hometree. IN THE COCKPIT Quaritch grows impatient. QUARITCH Alright, lets get this done. Give me forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the front door. GUNNER Roger. CS forties. Going hot. QUARITCH Fire. On the Dragons stubwings the mm ROCKET LAUNCHERS open up with a BARRAGE of leaping fire which FLASHES down and KWHOOM!KWHOOM!KWHOOM! the inside of Hometree ERUPTS with multiple EXPLOSIONS of TEARGAS. THE GAS rolls across the confused villagers. They begin to cough and gag. Eytukan and the remaining HUNTERS bravely fire at the gunships with their longbows. IN THE DRAGONS COCKPIT, Quaritch laughs as arrows CLINK against the armored windows. AMID CLOUDS of teargas, the Omaticaya run, stumble, collapse. EYTUKAN (yelling/subtitled) Everybody outside! Go to the Forest. The villagers pour out of Hometree. Everyone is yelling. Piercing SCREAMS in the boiling gas. JAKE, eyes streaming, struggles with his bindings. KAWHOOM! An INCENDIARY ROUND explodes inside the Commons. FLAMES ROAR through the base of Hometree. . INSIDE HOMETREE it is a burning smoky HELL. Flames roar up the inside like a chimney. STRAGGLERS scramble outside, coughing and dragging wounded with them. High up in the trunk, TSUTEY and his hunters leap rapidly from spoke to spoke, climbing barely ahead of the fireball. OUTSIDE the fire is driven by the rotorwash toward JAKE and GRACE who are still bound tightly to the posts. Out of the smoke, MOAT appears in front of Jake. She raises a KNIFE and SLASHES DOWNWARD. Jake looks down, surprised, to see his bonds falling away. He meets her eyes, which are filled with horror, but also something else. Call it faith. MOAT You are one of us. Help us! Jake takes the knife and cuts Grace free. JAKE Weve gotta move! Hes gonna blow the columns. As Grace realizes what he means, he grabs her and they RUN. Around them the Omaticaya flee in horror and confusion. IN THE COCKPIT, Quaritch watches as the Omaticaya stream away from the Great Tree, running along roots and branches. QUARITCH Thats how you scatter the roaches. Okay, switch missiles. Give me HEs at the base of the west columns. PILOTS (V.O.) Copy, switching missiles. IN TRUDYS SAMSON she hears the other pilots acknowledging Quaritchs order. TRUDY Screw it. She takes her finger OFF the firecontrol and pulls her aircraft out of formation. PUSHING IN ON QUARITCH, the Hometree reflecting in his glasses. . QUARITCH Bring it down. MISSILES stream down from the DRAGON and the other gunships and The base of Hometree VANISHES in a chain of HIGHEXPLOSIVE BLASTS. The massive PILLARS fragment into matchsticks, and The Omaticaya watch in horror as HOMETREE GROANS and starts to MOVE. In a cacophony of cracking, splintering roots, the mighty tree TOPPLES with agonizing slowness. AT THE BANSHEE EYRIE, TSUTEY and the other hunters spur their mounts into flight. They swoop among the branches as the tree, the one fixed thing in their lives, MOVES. It CRASHES DOWN through the forest canopy, crushing the lesser trees in its path, FALLING PONDEROUSLY. HOMETREE hits the ground like the end of the world, raising a great cloud of dust and pulverized debris. IN THE DRAGON cockpit, Quaritch surveys the destruction. QUARITCH Nice work people. Alright, lets light it up. INCENDIARIES launch from the gunships, EXPLODING into gouts of FIRE in the debris of Hometree. THE GUNSHIPS fan the flames through the trees like a fire storm. The Omaticaya retreat as a WALL OF FIRE advances. JAKE SEARCHES for Neytiri amid swirling smoke and sparks. JAKE Neytiri! Neytiri! GRACE is gathering crying CHILDREN, and herding them away from the firestorm. NEYTIRI stumbles through the burning wreckage at the edge of the INFERNO. She sees EYTUKAN. A large shard of wood is driven through him like a spear. He recognizes her as she kneels over him. . EYTUKAN (subtitled) Daughter take my bow. Protect the People. In his last living moment he places his bow in her hands. She collapses over him, her face crumpling in grief. JAKE reels out of the smoke. Kneels next to her. JAKE Im sorry She shoves him away and stands, screaming at him as tears stream down her face. NEYTIRI Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never come back! Jake stumbles back as she slumps down by her fathers body. Sparks and smoke swirl around him. He watches as NETYIRI kneels, grieving. Slumped over, clutching her stomach. Keening like an animal. SLOW MOTION Jake staggers lost and alone through the burning forest. Utterly shattered. Eyes vacant. JAKE (V.O.) I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. Sooner or later though, you always have to wake up... INT. LINK ROOM SELFRIDGE watches a video feed of the destruction on one of the monitors. Max and NORM stare in shock. SELFRIDGE Pull the plug. A TROOPER crosses to the console and grabs the handle of the MASTER BREAKER EXT. RAINFOREST The strings are cut. Jake flops to the ground, limp. Elsewhere in the smoky Hell, Grace slumps unconscious. The crying kids pull at her. Moat, leading a group of Omaticaya, comes upon the scene. . She grabs the kids and pulls them away, leaving Graces avatar helpless in the path of the flames. She hesitates, then MOAT (subtitled) Bring her. INT. LINK ROOM BLACKNESS. Then the top clamshell of Jakes unit is yanked upward, and troopers grab him, ziptie his wrists as we CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DUSK ON A HILLSIDE a grieving Neytiri stands with Mo'at and the Omaticaya refugees. Two hunters pull Graces avatar on a travois. They watch as the flames burn like a funeral pyre below. A great pall of smoke darkens the landscape. DISSOLVE TO: INT. LOCKUP NIGHT Jake, Grace, and Norm are in a common holding cell. They sit, staring in silence. Too wired to sleep, too emotionally drained to move. GRACE They never wanted us to succeed. AT THE DESK OUTSIDE, the lone TROOPER looks up as TRUDY approaches along the corridor, pushing a stainless steel trolley. TRUDY Personally I think steaks too good for these traitors. GUARD They get steak? Thats bullshit. Let me see that The guard bends to look into the hot cart and THE MUZZLE of Trudys pistol presses behind his ear. . TRUDY Oops. (shoving him down) All the way down, pendejo. She WHISTLES and MAX trots around the corner. Trudy binds the guard with one of his own zipties as Max grabs his KEY CARD and runs to the cell. Swipes the card. The door is rolling open when ANOTHER TROOPER rounds the corner. Trudy takes him down with a sharp BLOW to the windpipe and a THAI KNEE to the ribs. Meanwhile the first TROOPER is getting up, but Max CLOCKS him heartily with a coffee urn. He goes down and stays down. MAX That was unexpectedly satisfying. Trudy plants a kiss on Norm as he runs out of the cell. NORM Baby, you rock. Jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper as Trudy binds his wrists. JAKE (to Max and Trudy) Thanks. Jake faces his motley group, chambering a round. JAKE So what do you say? Time for a revolution? GRACE Im free. Trudy grins and taps his fist. JAKE Come on. CUT TO: INT. UTILIDOR In the utility corridor under the base, Jake pumps the chair furiously, as the others jog. They reach an AIRLOCK and start donning EXOPACKS. . JAKE (to Trudy) Get your ship fired up. Trudy nods. She grabs Norm and enters the airlock. Jake turns to Max. JAKE Stay here. I need somebody on the inside I can trust. Max nods. Jake grips his hand tightly. CUT TO: EXT. AIRFIELD NIGHT IN THE SAMSON, Norm is helping Trudy race through the preflight checks as the turbines spool up. A LIGHT hits them. An armored TROOPER approaches, aiming his AR at them. TROOPER I need you to shut down and step out of the vehicle! Now! JAKE rolls up behind him, aiming his pistol. JAKE Take it nice and easy, troop. The trooper turns, sees the gun. JAKE On the ground, face down. Hands behind your head. The trooper hesitates. GRACE Do what he goddamn says! He does. Norm jumps down and grabs the troopers rifle and sidearm, covering him, while Grace helps Jake from chair to the back bay of the chopper. She throws his chair in, and jumps in herself. JAKE Go! Go! Go! . INT. OPS CENTER NIGHT QUARITCH, watching a monitor, sees whats happening down at the airfield. He slams his palm down on an ALARM BUTTON. He draws his PISTOL. Strides toward the EMERGENCY DOOR. He undogs it. EXT. OPS CENTER/AIRFIELD NIGHT HOLDING HIS BREATH Quaritch yanks the hatch open and strides onto the outer landing. Inside people scramble for MASKS. THE SAMSON lifts off in a blast of rotorwash just as QUARITCH OPENS FIRE and ROUNDS rake the ship. Trudy banks hard, using the bottom to shield them. Bullets WHACK into the ship as she climbsout over the treeline. Jakes fist pumps the air exultantly. JAKE Oh yeah, baby! GRACE Aaahh, crap. Not again. He looks over at Grace and freezes. She is looking down at a BLOODY HAND. She clutches her abdomen, covering the spreading stain. Looks at Jake, wideeyed. GRACE This is gonna ruin my whole day. JAKE Hang on, Grace. CUT TO: EXT. SHACK / SITE NIGHT NORMS AVATAR, with an AR slung over his shoulder, stands on the roof of the LINK MODULE. He gives a thumbs up signal. The lift cable goes taut and The shack LIFTS OFF THE GROUND. Trudys Samson beats the grass of the mountain meadow, straining to lift the module on a longline sling. The shack sways as Trudy banks across forested slopes and heads deeper into the HALLELUJAH MOUNTAINS. . INT. SAMSON CABIN NIGHT Outside the windows, clouds and cliffs pass by, lit by Polyphemus. Jake is yanking stuff out of the Samsons trauma bag, while Grace lies curled across two back seats, hugging her blood soaked abdomen. She is pale and shocky. Trudy is flying on visual only, by the light of Polyphemus. Her instruments are showing gibberish. TRUDY Well, at least they wont be able to track us up here. Not this deep in the vortex. JAKE Its strongest at the Well of Souls, right? TRUDY Yeah. JAKE Good, cause thats where were going. TRUDY Copy. He gives Grace an ampule of morphine for the pain. JAKE Im gonna get you some help, Grace. GRACE Forget it, it doesnt matter. Jake grabs her shoulders. JAKE No! The People can help you. I know it. CUT TO: EXT. WELL OF SOULS AERIAL DAWN Dawn light paints the massive ARCHES of magnetic rock above the Well of Souls. Tiny as an insect, the SAMSON passes. . JAKE (V.O.) The Well of Souls. The heart of the forest. I knew the People would go there. EXT. WELL OF SOULS DAWN The WELL OF SOULS is a deep caldera meters across. It is ringed with enormous WILLOWS whose roots seem to pour down the sheer rock walls like candle wax. AT THE BOTTOM, in a natural amphitheater, the Omaticaya refugees are clustered around a central rock outcropping which forms a kind of dais and altar. Shafts of dawn light reach to the bottom of the grotto, lighting a single willow the MOTHER TREE. Ancient and gnarled, it grows in the center of the rock. Its ROOTS spread down to the grotto floor, where they merge with the roots of the willows ringing the Well forming a braided mat resembling the surface of a brain. Mo'at stands on the dais, leading them in a CHANT. MOAT (subtitled) Wise ancestors who live within Eywa, guide us. Give us a sign. CUT TO: EXT. FOREST CLEARING DAWN The shack descends from the sky like a gift from the gods. It bumps to the ground. CUT TO: INT. SHACK DAY Grace lies, comatose, in her open link. Trudy gives Jake a look that says not much time. Jake feels Graces cold forehead, then crosses to his own link. As Trudy helps him in, Norm rapidly preps the system. NORM (low) Tsutey is Oloeyctan now. Hes not going to let you get near that place. JAKE Ive gotta try, Norm. . Jake pulls the clamshell down and we CUT TO: EXT. RUINS OF HOMETREE DAY CU JAKES AVATAR HIS EYES OPEN. He sits up. The forest is silent, shrouded in smoke that the sun cant penetrate. The animals have fled. Ash blows on the wind. JAKE (V.O.) Outcast. Betrayer. Alien. To ever face them again, I was gonna have to change the rules. DISSOLVE JAKE reaches the top of a rise. The forest beyond is utterly DEVASTATED. The trees burned and fallen. Small fires still flicker across a landscape in Hell. JAKE stares. It is his vision, made real. He stumbles through the dark wasteland, sparks and ash swirling around him. A SCREECH. Jake looks up as HIS BANSHEE bonded for life flaps down to a landing in front of him. He steps to it, and strokes its head. It nudges his chest like a horse. JAKE (V.O.) Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move. JAKE Come on, boy. Time to fly. OMIITED EXT. MOUNTAINS DAY THE GREAT LEONOPTERYX glides effortlessly along the ridge where Jake and Neytiri first encountered him. It scans for prey below, its magnificent indigocrested head cocking left, then right. JAKE (V.O.) The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up? FROM ABOVE THE SMALL SHADOW of Jakes banshee falls across the back of the mighty Toruk. . JAKE (V.O.) But that was just a theory. JAKE DIVES and WE RUSH DOWN toward the great beast and our own shadow then CUT TO: EXT. WELL OF SOULS LATE AFTERNOON The Omaticaya people lift their voices in a SONG filled with tragic loss and yearning for deliverance. CLOSE ON NEYTIRI, singing. A SHADOW CROSSES HER FACE. She looks up, and her eyes go wide as A TERRIBLE CRY echoes, turning all eyes skyward. AN ENORMOUS SHADOW covers the crowd as TORUK comes out of the sun, beating its huge wings to slow its descent. Its crimson and black wings, backlit by the sun, seem to glow from within. The People CRY OUT in alarm and scatter as the dreaded beast alights in their midst. And thats when they see JAKE, riding high on its shoulders, pluggedin to its antenna. It folds its wings and stands calmly amid the paralyzed Navi. Toruk lowers its body. They stare in awe as Jake dismounts and strokes the magnificent animals flank. NEYTIRI, TSUTEY and MOAT watch in stunned amazement as the legendary Rider of Last Shadow walks toward them. NEYTIRI (breathing the words) Toruk Macto. Neytiri raises her arms. NEYTIRI (shouting) Toruk Macto! ON THE FACES of the Omaticaya new hope dawning in their eyes. WHISPERS flow among them, the words REPEATED CROWD Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto... . Jake walks through the crowd, straight to Neytiri at the foot of the dais. He looks into her enormous eyes, and the emotion between them is powerful and pure. NEYTIRI I See you. JAKE (a hoarse whisper) I See you. Neytiris eyes brim with tears. NEYTIRI I was afraid Jake for my people. Im not any more. Jake takes Neytiris hand and climbs the steps of the dais. MOAT steps back in awe as he approaches. He turns to Tsutey, who stares at him with fear and incomprehension. Jake plays to the rapt crowd as he says JAKE (subtitled) Tsutey of the Rongloa, son of Ateyo. I stand before you, ready to serve the People. (then just for Tsutey) You are Oloeyctan, and you are the best warrior. I cant do this without you. Tsutey struggles with his emotions. Finally TSUTEY I will fly with you. JAKE Ireiyo. JAKE turns to the MATRIARCH. JAKE Grace is dying. I beg the help of the Great Mother. MO'AT Bring her, Jakesully. TIME CUT AVATAR JAKE carries Graces HUMAN BODY, lightly in his arms like a child. Jake walks through the crowd to the dais, followed by NORM, who carries GRACES AVATAR. . JAKE Look where we are, Grace. Her eyes flutter open. She looks up wonderingly at the Mother Tree. GRACE (with a wan smile) I need to take some samples. Mo'at directs them to lay both bodies among the roots on the altarrock. Moat touches Jakes shoulder and he steps back. MOAT (quietly) The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is Moats hand indicates Graces AVATAR MOAT in this body. CU JAKE, realizing the enormity of what shes saying. JAKE Is that possible? MOAT Possible, yes. She must pass through the Eye of Eywa and return. But Jakesully she is very weak. Jake kneels next to Grace, taking her tiny human hand in his avatar hand. JAKE Hang on, theyre gonna fix you up. Grace is barely conscious. She grips his hand. GRACE I always held back. But you gave them your heart. Im proud of you, Jake. Jake feels his throat close with emotion. Graces eyes blaze with intensity though her voice is faint. . GRACE Help them. You do whatever it takes. You hear me? JAKE I will. TIME CUT MOAT stands in a kind of trance amongst the tendrils of the Mother Tree. NEYTIRI and the other acolytes dance hypnotically. All the Omaticaya sway and chant to the rhythm of the drums. MACRO SHOT fine, hairlike THREADS have emerged from the roots and are gently spreading over Graces HUMAN skin. JAKE, still holding her hand, watches her body being fused to the rootfloor by a thousand connections. GRACES AVATAR is gently connected by the same questing ROOT CILIA they entwine with the QUEUE and spread over the body. The grotto is dark except for the spectral GLOW of the willows. The CHANT continues, hypnotically. MOAT, on her knees beneath the Mother Tree, writhes her arms in the trance state. Her eyes are rolled back, showing only WHITE. GRACE GASPS and her eyes SNAP OPEN. Her expression is AMAZED, as if seeing something so beautiful it can never be explained. ON HER HAND GRIPPING Jakes convulsively, as she tries to anchor herself to this world for a few more seconds GRACE Im with her Jake (an amazed whisper) shes real Grace SHUDDERS, as pain shoots through her. BLOOD seeps through the silken white rootcilia growing across her abdomen. Drowning WHITE in shocking CRIMSON. She exhales a last shuddering breath and goes STILL. JAKE Grace! He sees the roots falling away from her human body. JAKE TURNS hopefully toward her AVATAR but the roots are falling away from it as well. It sleeps VACANT. . MOAT stops the chant. She crosses to Jake and kneels with him, touching his shoulder. MOAT Her wounds were too great, there was not enough time. She is with Eywa now. NEYTIRI removes Graces mask and gently closes her eyes. Jake stands slowly, barely holding it together. NEYTIRI comes to him and he sees the despair and hope conflicting on her face and he raises his head. TURNS to face TSUTEY and the CROWD. JAKE With your permission, I will Speak now. You would honor me by translating. Tsutey gestures assent, and they face the clan together. JAKE SPEAKS, the pain of Graces death in the passion and fury of his voice. Tsutey TRANSLATES beside him. JAKE The Sky People have sent a message that they can take whatever they want, and no one can stop them. But we will send them a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind can carry you, tell the other clans to come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to them. Fly now with me brothers and sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky People that this is our land! TSUTEY finishes with a bloodcurdling warcry, and the entire CLAN responds, their shouts echoing across the forest. JAKE takes Neytiris hand and runs to the leonopteryx. He vaults onto its back and pulls her up behind him. THE HUNTERS run to their banshees, mounting quickly. Jakes leonopteryx rises on mighty wings into the night sky. With a thunder of wings, the banshees take off after it. LONG LENS POLYPHEMUS. Across its face, the banshees rise like a swarm of bats. Groups of riders peel off in different directions. CUT TO: . EXT. CLAN GATHERING NIGHT JAKE and NEYTIRI stand before the gathered members of ANOTHER CLAN. Jake speaks as she translates. We dont hear the words. TRACK ACROSS the faces of the clan, a sea of eyes in flickering firelight. JAKE (V.O.) We rode out to the four winds. To the horse clans of the plain, to the ikran people of the mountains. When Toruk Macto called them, they came. VARIOUS ANGLES SLOW MOTION as riders vault onto their armored direhorses. Banshee riders raise spears and bows, spurring their mounts to leap skyward. CUT TO: EXT. WELL OF SOULS DAWN With a WHOOSH and the crack of mighty wings, JAKE RETURNS. Jake and Neytiri alight from his legendary mount. Around them HUNDREDS OF BANSHEES are landing. A gathering of eagles. FROM ABOVE we can see hundreds of Navi streaming down into the Well of Souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest above it. DIREHORSE RIDERS are arriving along many trails. BANSHEE RIDERS circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the grotto. JAKE, standing next to the Leonopteryx, watches his army gathering. CUT TO: INT. COMMISSARY DAY Its standing room only as all base personnel are crowded into the dining hall. A portable D GRAPHICS PROJECTOR has been set up, and the lights are down. QUARITCH stands in front of the display image a classic premission briefing. QUARITCH People, you are fighting for survival. Theres an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. First slide. . The display shows an overhead image of the Well of Souls. It looks like Woodstock in the jungle. QUARITCH These orbital images show the hostiles numbers have gone from a couple of hundred to over two thousand in one day, and more are pouring in. By next week it could be twenty thousand. Then theyll be overrunning our perimeter here. We cant wait. Our only security lies in pre emptive attack. We will fight terror with terror. TRACKING ACROSS the grim faces of the miners and troopers. Fear transforming to hatred in their eyes. QUARITCH Next slide. This mountain stronghold is supposedly protected by their deity. When we destroy it, we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep they wont come within a thousand klicks of this place. CUT TO: INT. ARMOR BAY DAY TROOPERS issue automatic weapons and magazines to a long line of mine workers. The miners lock and load like the red blooded redneck NRA supporters they are. BLASTING TECHS are setting radiodetonated primer charges into twoton stacks of EXPLOSIVE COMPOUND. The stacks are bandstrapped together on pallets. TRACKING WITH SELFRIDGE, staring around him in growing dismay as he walks through the fullscale mobilization. He approaches Quaritch, who is barking orders amid a hive of activity around the ampsuits. SELFRIDGE This thing is completely out of control! Quaritch ignores him, turning away to focus on ordnance loading. SELFRIDGE Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to turn the mineworkers local into a freakin militia! . QUARITCH I declared threat condition red. That puts all onworld assets under my command. SELFRIDGE You think you can pull this palace coup shit on me?! I can have your ass with one call Quaritch grabs him and PINS him against the side of an ampsuit. QUARITCH Youre a long way from Earth. Selfridge is paralyzed. Physical force against him? Quaritch releases him and walks away. QUARITCH (to his men) Get him out of here. Several troopers converge on Selfridge. SELFRIDGE You touch me youre so fired. He pushes through them and they escort him toward the door. CUT TO: INT. SHACK DAY HUMAN JAKE, NORM and TRUDY are gathered around the comms monitor, talking to MAX. MAX I dont know how secure this channel is. JAKE Talk fast. MAX Its crazy here, Jake. Its full mobilization. Theyre rigging the shuttles as bombers. Theyve made up these big pallets of mine explosives. Its for some kind of shock and awe campaign. TRUDY Frickin daisycutters. . NORM Holy shit. JAKE (to Max) Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can cut some kinda deal before this thing goes all the way. MAX No, Quaritch has taken over. Hes rolling and theres no stopping him. JAKE When? MAX Oh six hundred tomorrow. Jake takes that in. JAKE Thanks. Max signs off. NORM Were screwed. TRUDY You know hes gonna commit those bombers straight to the Well of Souls. JAKE Thats right. Because I gave it to him on a plate. TRUDY We both did. NORM If he takes out the Well of Souls its over. Its their main line to Eywa, to their ancestors itll destroy them. JAKE Then I guess we better stop him. Jake looks like hes about to collapse. Hes gaunt, eyes deeply shadowed, hands shaking. TRUDY You need to get some rack. . He grabs a packet of freezedried crystals and pours them directly into his mouth, chewing them up. JAKE Gonna have to settle for coffee. CUT TO: EXT. BATTLE CAMP DUSK TRACKING through the warrior camp above the Well of Souls. Hundreds of hunters from many clans prepare their weapons. Hunters paint the wings of their banshees like war ponies. DIREHORSES are painted and ornamented with totemic streamers. The Navi paint and pierce themselves. Dance. Bathe in the smoke of cleansing herbs RITUAL PURIFICATION. HUGE DRUMS are beaten. A dark primeval energy. They are psyching themselves up for battle. JAKE (V.O.) I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace. But there was only one thing I was ever really good at. Oohrah. TIME CUT Jake, Neytiri a group of banshee riders squat around an animal skin on which he has drawn the silhouette of a Scorpion gunship like a hunt totem. JAKE (Navi/subtitled) Strike here and here. Jake splats red dye at the centers of the circles symbolizing the rotors. The Navi absorb the lesson eagerly, like kids. He sees TRUDY approaching and breaks off. Neytiri stays with the hunters, talking about what theyve learned. TRUDY (low) You know our chances suck. JAKE Yeah. TRUDY Going up against gunships with bows and arrows... JAKE Whats your point? . TRUDY (nodding) Right. She taps his fist and walks away toward her SAMSON. CUT TO: EXT. WELL OF SOULS NIGHT The cookfires of the battle camp FLICKER like a constellation around the edge of the Well of Souls as JAKE slips down into the darkened, empty amphitheater. He moves to the MOTHER TREE gnarled, ancient, MAJESTIC. The roots spread in all directions, like the center of the world. Jake steps forward. The willowlike tendrils SWAY toward him, moving in a breeze that isnt there. JAKE Ive never done this in my life. He squats at the base of the tree. JAKE And Im probably just talking to a tree right now. But if youre there I need to give you a heads up. He looks up into the tree. The hanging tendrils undulate softly. Its easy to imagine a presence. JAKE If Grace is there with you look in her memories she can show you the world we come from. Theres no green there. They killed their Mother, and theyre gonna do the same thing here. FROM UP IN THE TREE, looking down. WOODSPRITES float in silence, moving around aimlessly. JAKE More Sky People are gonna come. Theyre gonna come like a rain that never ends Neytiri approaches silently behind him, listening. JAKE until theyve covered the world. Unless we stop them. . (MORE) Look, you chose me for somethin. And Ill stand and fight, you know I will. But I could use a little help here. Jake senses Neytiri and turns. NEYTIRI Our Great Mother does not take sides. She protects only the balance of life. She comes to him, intertwining her long fingers with his. JAKE It was worth a try. They lean in, foreheads touching, bodies pressed together. Holding each other in this, the last moment of peace. CUT TO: TIGHT ON a turbine as it starts to turn. Its RISING WHINE carries over A SERIES OF RHYTHMIC CUTS: MAGAZINES are slammed into automatic weapons. AMMO BELTS are fed into rotary cannons. MISSILES are attached to gunship stubwings. TIGHT ON BLUE HANDS sharpening wooden arrows. Stringing bows. Cinching direhorse harnesses. TROOPERS DROP into ampsuit cockpits. PILOTS close gunship canopies. TROOPERS run up shuttle ramps. LONG LENS STACK, tight and abstract on gunships as they rise in a swarm amid boiling turbine exhaust and blasting rotor wash. EXT. RAINFOREST/ AERIAL DAWN WIDE SHOT TILTROTORS fill the sky. Deadly armored beetles. The DRAGON leads the formation, flanked by SCORPIONS. Behind that is a wave of SAMSONS, and last, the two enormous VALKYRIE shuttles, packed with troops and ampsuits. INSIDE THE DRAGON, Quaritch surveys his armada as they skim over the tree tops. THEY SWEEP toward the Hallelujah mountains in a thundering wave. . JAKE (cont'd) EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL DAWN SQUADRONS OF BANSHEES darken the sky in waves, led by a single GREAT LEONOPTERYX. Jake sits astride his mount, flanked by Neytiri and Tsutey on their banshees. EXT. MOUNTAINS DAWN THE DRAGON DESCENDS on final approach to a large clearing the LZ. The Samsons flair and touch down, disgorging troops, while the gunships hover protectively. THE VALKYRIES blast the ground with their powerful lift jets. They land. The ramps drop. Troopers pour out, weapons leveled, advancing in a cordon. UP ANGLE as AMPSUITS descend from the Dragon on cables. Their massive feet smash down, and they march forward, leading the army into the forest. LYLE WAINFLEET, walking point in his hydraulic suit, scans his cockpit screens. He sees movement on the FLIR display ghostly THERMAL SIGNATURES. WAINFLEET Contact. Two hundred meters. A chilling SOUND echoes through the forest the ululating WAR CRIES of untold Navi. The troopers, look around, spooked. They cant tell where the sound is coming from. Then they feel it the GROUND ITSELF SHAKING. They grip their weapons, bracing themselves as THREE HUNDRED NAVI HORSEMEN charge through the forest at a full gallop, their hooves POUNDING the earth. It is an awesome sight. NORM SPELLMAN rides with the Navi hunters, carrying an assault rifle. THE NAVI CHARGE thunders toward the human line. The hunters raise their bows as THE AMPSUITS raise their GAUs. ON THE THERMAL IMAGERS targetcursors track the ghost riders. QUARITCH Fire for effect. The entire line of troopers opens fire. TRACERS riddle the jungle, blasting foliage into confetti. . CHARGING DIREHORSES crash down, flipping over. Riders are flung off. The withering fire continues, and the ranks are decimated as RIDERS LAUNCH their arrows at a full gallop. A few hit their marks among the troopers. NORM FIRES his AR on full auto. TWO CHARGING DIREHORSES have a heavy log slung between them like a battering ram. At a full gallop they hit an ampsuit, FLIPPING IT onto its back with a blownout canopy. Victory is short lived as the two riders are cut down. NORMS HORSE is hit by tracer fire. He is flung off as the creature cartwheels. He hits hard, scrambling for cover as A WARRIOR HURLS his spear a moment before his horse is cut down. It SLAMS through an ampsuits canopy but THE MERCILESS FIRE continues. Horses rear and collapse. Riders pivot their mounts to flee and THE THERMAL SCREENS show the remaining ghost riders scattering. LYLE signals and the line advances, firing sporadically at moving targets. OVERHEAD, NAVI HUNTERS stream through the trees, running along the branches. As the troopers advance into bow range, the NAVI open fire and TROOPERS SPROUT ARROWS in throat, legs, masks the targets Jake taught them, but THE FIRING LINE aims upward, tracking the THERMAL TARGETS. TRACERS rip through the foliage and NAVI FALL while others retreat as bark and wood is blasted off the limbs beneath their feet. NORM sprints frantically through the woods, shouting into his HANDSET NORM Jake! Jake! Were falling back! SURVIVING NAVI flee the horrific onslaught. It is a total rout. IN THE DRAGON, Quaritch catches glimpses of the figures streaming through the forest below. . QUARITCH Blue team, switch forties. Fire at will. Led by the Dragon, the gunships FIRE streamers of mm ROCKETS ahead of them. The jungle EXPLODES with HE bursts. Circular SHOCK WAVES flash outward through the jungle STROBOSCOPIC GLIMPSES of terrified horses rearing, Navi leaping, as the jungle rocks with the concussive onslaught. HUNTERS LOOK UP as a dark shape hovers overhead. The downblast of the VALKYRIES lift jets shreds the forest. INSIDE THE SHUTTLES cargo bay, a row of DAISYCUTTERS are lined up. Troopers roll the first pallet down the ramp. THE PALLET falls into the jungle below and BAWHOOOOOM! an enormous highexplosive blast rips a huge hole in the forest. A white concussion wave flashes out across the ground for hundreds of meters in all directions. AT GROUND LEVEL it is an apocalypse. Running Navi are blasted out of existence by fire and shock waves. IN THE CARGO BAY the troopers WHOOP and highfive. TROOPERS Yeah baby! Get some! GROUND TROOPS ADVANCE, firing flamethrowers, ARs and GAU s. EXT. FLOATING MOUNTAINS AERIAL Quaritchs fleet flies into the shadow of the Mountain of Truth. QUARITCH Blue team, stay with the ground units. Red team, with me. Were punching for the main target. Quaritch glances up to see A squadron of WINGED SHAPES, diving out of the morning glare like birds of prey. CLOSE ON JAKE, rushing straight down, SCREAMING a war cry as he leads the charge and SCORES OF BANSHEES SLAM into the gunships and Samsons like falcons hitting fat turkeys. The air battle is joined. . JAKES GREAT LEONOPTERYX flairs into its signature crimson X shape just before KWHAM!! it knocks a Scorpion tumbling. It coils around the gunship, slashing furiously as they spin together. JAKE can barely hang onto the gyrating creature. The pilot of the Scorpion sees nothing but jaws slamming into his canopy. Jake releases the gunship and it careens into a CLIFF, tearing off one rotor then plummets into the trees. There is a satisfying FIREBALL. SCORPIONS fall out of formation to pursue individual banshee riders, FIRING cannons and rockets. JAKE BANKS as the cliff face next to him explodes with cannon rounds. SCREAMING down on him is another Scorpion. JAKE tucks and dives along the cliff, feeling the rounds splitting the air around him and The Scorpions bank after the furiously jinking banshees as they head for cover among the floating mountains, or dive down into the trees. DOOR GUNNERS in a SAMSON are shooting down banshees like Messerschmidts from a B as WE FOLLOW TSUTEYS BANSHEE in a full delta dive. He swoops in from its blind spot and THE GUNNERS SWIVEL too late as Tsutey flashes past them, SHOOTING ARROWS with deadly accuracy. A SCORPION gunship dives after a banshee. It fires an airto air missile and the banshee vanishes in an EXPLOSION. WIDE SHOT as thirty ships and hundreds of banshees wheel and dive, like the Battle of Britain. Banshees are hit by guns and missiles, falling out of the sky. The occasional trail of smoke and fire marks the demise of a tiltrotor. IN THE CENTER the Dragon is pouring out hellacious fire tracer rounds from multiple turrets and missiles from the stubwing pods. NEYTIRI BANKS hard as TRACERS flash past her. A Scorpion is right on her ass as SHE ROLLS inverted and dives under the edge of Mons Veritatis, then rolls out, zigzagging through the dangling vines but . THE GUNSHIP stays on her. It rips through the vines, and tracers FLASH toward us as SHE JINKS the banshee around a thundering waterfall but HER PURSUER explodes right through the curtain of water. It launches an airtoair missile. NEYTIRI jinks hard, diving. The missile hits a rock outcropping, pummeling her with the shock wave. THE GUNSHIP follows her through a narrow slit between Mons Veritatis and a smaller floating island. They run this slot rolled up on their sides and THE SCORPION GUNNER locks up Neytiri for a missile shot but A SHADOW crosses his canopy. Out of the sun comes a crimson demon, shrieking over the roar of the turbines, and KWHAMMM!! The leonopteryx SLAMS the gunship, driving it downward in a dive. The leonopteryx lashes at it with claws and teeth as they fall together out of control. Jake kicks the gunship loose and it falls like a brick, breaking its back on a rocky promontory and EXPLODING. FLYING WITH A SAMSON as a SECOND SAMSON falls in beside it. This one has its pilot door off, and the PILOT is wearing a breathing mask. The door gunners wave at TRUDY, her expression grim behind her mask. She holds the cyclic stick between her knees while she RAKES the other ship with BURSTS from an AR in her lap. The pilot slumps over and the craft tumbles out of control. TRUDY Youre not the only ones with guns, you pricks. NEYTIRI JINKS her banshee hard, an enemy Samson right behind her. The pilot is a hotdog, following her down into the trees, under the canopy. They slalom among the trunks at high speed. The gunners hang half out the doors, firing. Bark and leaves explode around Neytiri as she zigzags through the jungle. THE BANSHEE dives under a huge tree limb, and the pilot follows. He looks up at the last second, catching a glimpse of blueskinned figures. THE HUNTERS drop a net of woven vines behind Neytiri and . The SAMSON hits it hard. The net fouls the ship, FLIPPING IT backwards. It crashes upside down to the forest floor. KABOOM!! NEYTIRIS BANSHEE is hit by GROUNDFIRE. It folds up like a broken kite, crashing down through branches and SHE SLAMS into the ground, stunned. IN THE DRAGON Quaritch looks ahead, seeing the WELL OF SOULS. He taps the pilot and points QUARITCH There it is. (into his headset) Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is in sight. IN THE CARGO BAY of Valkyrie One, the troopers ready their deadly loads. TROOPER Target in sight. CIRCLING ABOVE, Tsutey falls in beside Jake, who talks to him by AIRCOM HEADSET. JAKE We have to stop the shuttles, no matter what it takes. TSUTEY nods. He signals, gathering other hunters, who fall in with him as he dives. Jake rolls in after them but A GUNSHIP drops in behind him and he is forced to evade as TSUTEY LEADS the attack on the first shuttle. Hunters jink and weave through WITHERING FIRE from the escort ships. GUNNERS with jerryrigged gun mounts ride the broad backs of the shuttles, picking off banshees who get past the escort. TSUTEY is RAKED by a burst from the dorsal gunners. His mount crumples, plummeting with a dying scream and WE SPIRAL DOWN with him, the forest rushing up and A BLINDING BLIZZARD of green as he tears downward, catching at leaves and vines. He SLAMS to the ground, badly injured. NEARBY, ampsuits and troopers advance across the forest floor, firing their cannons and flamethrowers. The GAUs rip the forest to shreds. . Norm, firing as he retreats, is HIT. He collapses, his avatar body mortally wounded as HYDRAULIC FEET approach, passing the bodies of direhorses and Na'vi hunters. Norm painfully tries to load another magazine, panting in fear and pain as AN AMPSUIT stomps up. Aims its cannon point blank. BBLAM! INT. SHACK The top of Norms LINK bangs open. He reels out, collapsing onto the floor, clutching himself as if he can still feel the pain of death. He sits, huddled, shivering crazed. EXT. RAINFOREST TSUTEY lies gasping, mortally injured. He looks up, grimacing, as an ampsuit looms over him. LYLE WAINFLEET reaches down and grabs Tsutey by his queue, lifting him painfully. WAINFLEET I hear this is worse than death for you, chief. WAINFLEET cuts Tsutey's queue off near the base. TSUTEY SCREAMS in agony, his nervous system exploding on overload. Grinning, Lyle holds up the queue Tsutey's only connection to the worldconsciousness which is his life. NEYTIRI bleeding, bruised staggers amid burning wreckage. AMPSUIT footsteps approach and she crouches behind a tree. Troopers are seconds from seeing her as NEYTIRI knocks an arrow to HER FATHERS BOW, and readies herself for a last kamikaze shot when THE TROOPER on the far right of the firing line sees something on his screens. TROOPER Right flank somethings coming! Its all lit up out there. The troopers become aware of the GROUND SHAKING. A slow building thunderous ROAR and AN AMPSUIT comes FLYING out of the trees, cartwheeling past them, and the SHAKING BUILDS . EXT. WELL OF SOULS Mo'at opens her eyes in sudden realization as EXT. FOREST The troopers pivot to face A WALL OF CHARGING HAMMERHEADS CRASHING out of the foliage in a shower of broken branches as THE TROOPERS open fire but the stampede drives over them like a wave. Treetrunk feet shatter the ampsuit cockpits. Troopers are crushed or asphyxiated. NEARBY the footsoldiers see LIVING SHADOWS flow out of the gloom as VIPERWOLVES race among them with flashing jaws. The troopers FIRE wildly as they go down, hitting each other as much as their attackers. The survivors break and run as more viperwolves bound out of the shadows. JAKE BANKS, watching as HUNDREDS of riderless WILD BANSHEES converge on Quaritchs ships. They literally darken the sky. JAKE What the hell ? The wild banshees wheel among the ships, ripping into them. ON JAKE slowly getting it. EYWA is in the fight. JAKE WHOOHOOOO! A GUNNER fires from the door of a Samson. There is a CRASH and the head of a BANSHEE lunges in the open door, jerking him out. Other banshees tear at the pilots windshield. NEYTIRI watches in awe as the ground troops scatter in disarray. The viperwolves flash past her, ignoring her. She senses something and turns slowly to see A THANATOR emerging from the smoke behind her. A glistening black demon. She stands paralyzed before its stygian gaze and the thanator lowers itself, until its head is just above the ground. It holds that position waiting. . Trembling, she approaches the waiting demon. EXT. FOREST A smoky hell. Fires burn all around. The troopers are disorganized, falling back. Shooting at shadows. Panicked yelling fills the comm freq. WAINFLEET and another AMPSUIT are charging together through the smoky gloom. WAINFLEET A and C squads rally at my pos. I want (screaming on the comm) Whos screaming God damn it?! TROOPER (ON RADIO) We gotta get outta here! Whoevers in charge, call for extraction! WAINFLEET Shutup you crybabies! SOMETHING slams into the other suit, tackling it OUT OF FRAME. Wainfleet whirls to see his squadmate missing. He moves through a screen of foliage to reveal The AMPSUIT ripped open. Driver gone. Blood inside the cockpit. He WHIRLS at a sound in time to see A THANATOR LEAPING straight at him WAINFLEET raises his cannon but WHAM!! Its on him, slamming him to the ground. The cannon goes flying. Hes face to face with its nightmare jaws, right outside his canopy On its back is NEYTIRI, and its a toss up which one looks more pissed off. The thanator rears back, muscles rippling as it poises to strike and KKRAAACKK! Slams its teeth right through his canopy. Wainfleets SCREAM is brief. Neytiris demon mount rears up and its triumphant ROAR echoes through the forest. INT. CORRIDOR Max runs down the hall, leading the other scientists. Hes yelling into an AIRCOM HANDSET . MAX Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max. Tell Jake we are in motion. (to the scientists) Get in there. Barricade the door! INT. LINK ROOM The door is hurled open and the SCIENTISTS charge in. Science geeks barricade the door as AVATARDRIVERS scramble into their link units, pulling the clamshells down. INT. CORRIDOR Max checks the door is secure from his side then runs down a connecting corridor. CUT TO: EXT. SHACK HUMAN NORM emerges from the airlock, wearing breathing gear and carrying an AR. He stumbles, dazed, toward the battle. EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL JAKE SIGNALS and a formation of hunters rolls in, diving at the lead shuttle, which is already besieged by winged creatures. THE CARGO RAMP is the scene of a pitched battle. Navi hunters hurl themselves off their mounts in waves, overwhelming the troopers. HUNTERS are shot, falling out of the ship, as others fly in. They shoot arrows and spears from the end of the ramp, and troopers fall back deeper into the fuselage. The panicked CREW CHIEF slams a switch and the ramp begins to close, a second before he is cut down by a spear. JAKES LEONOPTERYX plummets at the shuttle from behind. He swoops down, flairs to reduce speed, rolls off his mount and lands, tumbling on the shuttles broad back as GUNNERS try to swing their guns toward him but he RAKES them with his AR, still running forward and JAKE PULLS two grenades from his battle harness, yanking the pins out with his teeth. He hurls them down the intakes of the VTOL turbofans as HIS LEONOPTERYX BANKS in a tight arc back toward him and . HE SPRINTS ON as the grenades EXPLODE, shattering the turbines, which riddle the fuselage with shrapnel and JAKE LEAPS INTO SPACE, landing on the back of his mount and reconnecting. They flap away, gaining altitude as fire BLASTS out of the bottom of the shuttle. ON THE FLIGHT DECK, the pilot feels the ship dropping. PILOT Mains to a hundred percent! Get me airspeed! The pilot and copilot slam the throttle levers forward and The FUSION ENGINES BLAZE, thrusting the shuttle forward. It still falls, its remaining lift fans screaming, until ITS CLIPPING the tree tops when it gets enough translational lift to fly and THE PILOT PULLS back on the stick, lifting the nose. PILOT Were good! BEHIND HIM, a surviving Navi hunter runs forward and THOONK! ARROWHEADS sprout from the pilots necks and chests. THE SHUTTLE CLIMBS out of control, at full acceleration. It SLAMS into the underside of MONS Veritatis. It EXPLODES, and hundreds of tons of flaming debris drop back into the forest. ON THE FLIGHT DECK of the other SHUTTLE, the pilots watch the wreckage falling. PILOT Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any of yall want to get off this piece of shit planet, you better cover our ass, cause were the only way back to orbit. GUNSHIP PILOT Roger that. FROM THE DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch watches the shuttle bank away, with most of the remaining gunships following. QUARITCH Get back here you worthless pukes! . PILOT Are we breaking off? Quaritch draws his pistol. QUARITCH What do you think? He is over the edge no logic in his brain now. Only death. INT. OPS CENTER/CORRIDOR Techs and troopers crowd around consoles, listening to all the yelling and confusion as they try to plot the disintegrating battle. SELFRIDGE (in growing alarm) What the hell is going on out there? CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST Regular troopers and volunteers FLEE through the jungle, scrambling to board SAMSONS as they touch down. INT. DRAGON COCKPIT The pilot listens to comms from Hells Gate. PILOT Sir, all ground units are falling back to the LZ. Quaritchs jaw clenches. QUARITCH Stay on target. EXT. WELL OF SOULS Mo'at LOOKS UP as the DRAGON appears over the trees like the shadow of Death. Around her, the Navi mothers clutch their children to them. We see AKWEYS BOY among them. INT. DRAGON COCKPIT Quaritch sets the target cursor on the MOTHER TREE and what we recognize is the ghostly figure of Mo'at. QUARITCH Switch missiles. Arm all pods. . PILOT Arming. QUARITCH Lets see what these blue bastards do when I bitchslap their goddess. EXT. MOUNTAINS/ AERIAL JAKES LEONOPTERYX drops toward the Dragon like a Mig . He pulls out, skimming over the ship. Uncoupling, he rolls backward off his mount and JAKE HITS, skidding, on the hull of the Dragon. He rolls to his feet, already running as QUARITCH sees the leonopteryx WHOOSH overhead and flap away with no rider. He snaplooks aft to see JAKE SPRINTING along the spine of the ship, yanking two grenades from his battleharness, pulling the pins with his teeth, then QUARITCHs hand shoots out and SLAMS the pilots CYCLIC STICK hard over. THE DRAGON lurches sideways, rolling sharply with a ROAR of protesting rotors and JAKE IS FLUNG off his feet. The grenades miss the TURBINE INTAKES. One bounces off the ship. The other lodges against a cowling and JAKE SLIDES OFF the ship, falling as KBLAM! The grenade blows a two meter hole in the hull WHOOOSHH! Pandoran air swirls inside. QUARITCH (to the pilot) Put your mask on. Quaritch leaps out of his seat, heading aft as JAKE GRABS the edge of a weapons pod, his feet dangling over open space. HOLDING HIS BREATH, Quaritch blows a RESCUE HATCH and leans outside. Jake sees him aim his massive PISTOL. KWHAM! KWHAM! Rounds clang next to Jakes head. He LETS GO, plummeting into the trees Jake plunges through jungle canopy. He catches a HUGE LEAF, as Neytiri taught him it bends down, breaking his fall . HE LETS GO, dropping again only to catch ANOTHER LEAF, and then another, and WE RUSH DOWN with him through this green blur. Jake drops to the ground in a feral crouch. Unhurt. JAKE (into his headset) Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of Souls! Hes got a clear shot. Hit him, anybody that can! Do it now! IN HER SAMSON Trudy Chacon is all business. TRUDY On it. SHE BANKS hard, pulling gs, coming around on the Dragon. She pours on the coal and the Samson leaps forward, straight at the WARSHIP. QUARITCH, DRILLS a stream of tracers at her, tearing through her canopy, ripping chunks off her fuselage. IN THE JUNGLE BELOW, Norm watches her kamikaze run NORM No! TRUDY (clipped, pilotlike) Norm, I love you. TRUDY DIVES, raking through treetops and then, at the last instant, YANKS BACK on the stick and THE SAMSON leaps straight up and KKRASH!! SHEARS OFF THE COCKPIT of the Dragon as QUARITCH THROWS HIMSELF aft along the aisle and TRUDYS SAMSON disintegrates, the wreckage burning as it tumbles into the jungle. MILES QUARITCH grips the bulkhead as he stares out the open front of the fuselage. Wind howls through wreckage where the pilot used to be. The forest rushes up to meet him and THE DRAGON CRASHES through splintering trees, IMPACTING in a lake with a WHITE BLAST of water. . EXT. RAINFOREST DAY Norm takes a few steps and drops to his knees. Imploded by grief. INT. OPS CENTER/ HELLS GATE ON THE PLOTTING DISPLAY as Quaritchs TRANSPONDER ICON disappears. TROOPER Dragon is down. Its off the board. SELFRIDGE What do you mean, off the board?! Selfridge is stunned. Suddenly the ROAR of an ENGINE makes them all look up. OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, MAX sits in the cab of an enormous SLASH CUTTER. Max flips Selfridge the bird and pushes a lever forward SELFRIDGE Oh shit. Selfridge DIVES as KRASHHHHH! The SPINNING TEETH of the SLASHCUTTER tear through the window in a blast of glass and lethal air. Alarms go off. The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris. The slashcutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE through the gaping hole into the Ops Center The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are holding the Ops Center. Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask. In shock. How could this be happening? CUT TO: EXT. LAKE THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises a AMPSUIT. Inside MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning. He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest. . QUARITCHS AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle. He sees something through the foliage ahead the SHACK. INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing. QUARITCH levels his GAU at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button WHAM!! A sixlegged BLACK DEMON tackles him. Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor. THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the suits hand but Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a treetrunk, almost crushing Neytiri. CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the suits KNIFE and QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanators chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing. QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped. Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant. JAKE (O.S.) Its all over Quaritch Quaritch turns, seeing Jake DROPPING from a tree limb. The suit rises slowly, knife glinting in the morning sun. QUARITCH Nothings over while Im breathing. JAKE Kinda hoped youd say that. QUARITCH SURGES forward. JAKE closes fast, snatching up the broken CANNON as . Quaritch SLASHES DOWN with the knife and Jake parries, blocking it with the cannon. He CLOSES faster than the suit can move and KCRACK! SLAMS the end of the cannon into the canopy, crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once twice again in a furious attack knocking the knife flying. QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before THUDDD! the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and JAKE DUCKS another roundhouse, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again then again until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jakes link sits just inside. INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and PFOOM! the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to pick up his KNIFE. NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator. QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake. QUARITCH How does it feel to betray your own race? Then, inexplicably, he TURNS. Walks away. FROM INSIDE the shack, we see him charge straight toward us and CRASH! he puts his hydraulic fist right through the window. He is reaching inside for the Link when JAKE HITS in a flying tackle with every ounce of force he has, knocking the ampsuit sideways and . JAKE REACHES around the suit, grabbing Quaritchs shoulder and, yanks him forward HARD, SMASHING his face into the edge of the cockpit but QUARITCH flings him off with a sweep of his arm, and Jake slams to the ground. INSIDE THE LINK Jake is holding his breath as the toxic Pandoran air swirls in. GAS ALARMS SHRIEK. NEYTIRI shoves with one free leg, desperately trying to pull her other leg out. THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat. INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as THE KNIFE reaches his throat as THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritchs chest. He looks up. NEYTIRI STANDS a FURY released. A classic archer figure, she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly. THWHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still. QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then with an ironic laugh he dies. NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn. Seeing Quaritch, she lowers her fathers bow. JAKE sees her, then goes limp, his eyes rolling back, and INT. SHACK HUMAN JAKE EXPLODES out of the Link, slamming to the floor where he gags for breath. With his last strength, he claws toward an emergency breathing mask across the room. He scrambles toward it, on the edge of unconsciousness. NEYTIRI VAULTS through the shattered window, landing in the debris like a cat. She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jakes side puts the mask over his face and . JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri, studying him as she holds him seeing his human body for the first time. Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue of her skin. There eyes meet across the glass of the mask together, separate. Worldless. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DAY MOAT tends to the mortally wounded TSUTEY as AVATAR JAKE arrives with Neytiri. Moat has bound his wounds, but by her expression, it is clear he cannot be saved. Jake kneels and Tsutey opens his eyes. Through a haze of pain, he recognizes Jake. TSUTEY (Navi) I See you, Jakesully. JAKE I See you, Tsutey te Rongloa Ateyitan. TSUTEY Are the people safe? JAKE Theyre safe. Tsutey weakly clutches his severed queue. TSUTEY I can never ride again, or bond with my woman or hear the voice of Eywa. I can not lead the People. You will lead them, Jakesully. JAKE No. Im not officer material. TSUTEY It is decided. Now do the duty of Oloeyctan. Set my spirit free. JAKE Im not killing you. TSUTEY I am already dead. . JAKE No. TSUTEY It is the way. And it is good. I will be remembered Tsuteys voice is weak, but thick with emotion. TSUTEY I fought with Toruk Macto, we were brothers and he was my last shadow. TSUTEYS HAND clasps with Jakes in a fierce grip. Jake draws his knife. TSUTEYS POV Jake leans forward, blocking the sun. HIS SHADOW falls across Tsutey. JAKE (Navi) Forgive me, my Brother. Go now to the Mother Spirit. By his movement, we know that he has ended Tsuteys pain. Jakes eyes well with tears as he continues reciting the prayer for the dead, and his Navi words carry over as we DISSOLVE TO: EXT. HELLS GATE DAY Navi ride direhorses among the abandoned machines of Hells Gate. Banshees roost on the roofs of the modules, and stingbats flutter about, unimpeded. The SENTRY GUNS are silent, and the GATES are open to the forest. JAKE (V.O.) A few chose to stay. Fewer were chosen. Max, Norm, and a few of the avatars hold ARs as the personnel of Hells Gate file up the cargo ramp of the remaining shuttle. The evicted humans are sullen and angry, like POWs. JAKE and NEYTIRI stand together, watching the departure of the Sky People. PARKER SELFRIDGE shuffles up the ramp. His eyes the eyes of a lost soul meet JAKES. He disappears into the ship. CUT TO: . EXT. SPACE ISV VENTURE STAR hangs suspended against the dark side of PANDORA. The ISVs antimatter engines BLAZE to life and it accelerates out of orbit. What remains IN FRAME is a virgin, primeval world. Spanning the black continents is a vast reticulated lacework of BIOLUMINESCENCE a ghostly WEB connecting all of Pandora. CUT TO: EXT. RAINFOREST DAY The suns rays shaft down through the layers of canopy. JAKE (V.O.) The forest will heal, and so will the hearts of the People. New life keeps the energy flowing, like the breath of the world. NEYTIRI, obviously pregnant, is bowfishing in the shallows. Children jump and squeal with laughter in the river. JAKE (V.O.)

Brokeback Mountain,tt0388795,2006,Oscar,"""BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN A Screenplay Adapted from an Annie Proulx Story By Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana February , l EXT: HIGHWAY: NIGHT (NEAR DAWN): ;.: A cattle truck, running empty, tops a ridge on a lonely western highway. To the east, the first faint flush of light. Across the plain, perhaps yet some twenty miles away, a sprinkle of lights like fallen stars on the vast dark plain. The truck roars on. INT: TRUCK CAB: NIGHT: CONTINUOUS: It is lighter now, but the light is high, and the olain still mainly dark, the lights of Signal, Wyoming vivid, closer now, perhaps five miles ahead. Patsy Cline's """"WALKIN' AFTER MI~NIGHT"""" on the radio. The TRUCKER, inscrutable, barrels on. Cabin is hazv with cigarette smoke.  In profile, WE SEE the passenger take an old mashedup Stetson off the dashboard. This is ENNIS DEL MAR: not yet twenty, but nonetheless compelling, not light or frivolous in disposition, appearance or manner, uncommonly quick reflexesa highschool dropout country boy with no prospects, brought up to hard work and privation, roughmannered, roughspoken, inured to the stoic life. Has outgrown his faded denirr. cowboy shirt, his wrists stick well out of the sleeves, the buttons gap. ENNIS (straightens the creases of the hat, sets it on his head) That's Signal, ain't it? TRUCKER (no conversationalist) Was the last time I come this way. ENNIS looks straight ahead at the lights. EXT: MAIN STREET: SIGNAL, WYOMING: DAY (LATER): Lighter st il L The truck stops with a screech of air brakes in front of a service station just opening for the day. An OLD MAN is rolling a tractor tire as big as he is into the garage. ENNIS steps out of the truck, no suitcase, just a grocery sack stuffed with his only other shirt and pair of Levi's. ( CONTI!IUED) l ,, . CONTINUED: The truck moves again, almost before he hits the ground, spraying him with dust. Tall, rawboned, lanky, possessed of a muscular, supple body made for the horse and for fightinghe stretches, looks at the OLD MAN, who looks back at him sourly. One of ENNIS'S boot heels is worn, has to adjust for the turn of the heel as he walks. No one in sight on the streets of Signal. After a moment, carrying his sack, ENNIS walks over to the OLD MAN, who is balancing the tractor tire against a pillar. ENNIS 'Scuse me. Mightin' you tell me where the Farm and Ranch Employment Office is at? OLD Kl\.N (not as sour as he looks, points) In that there trailer house. Three blocks down. You'll see it. ENNIS nods, tips his hat, starts off. OLD MAN Don't let that goddamn Joe Aguirre send you up to Brokeback without no thirty ought. There's coyotes and coyotes up there, they'll eat your damn sheep and your damn jackass, too. With a thirty ought, you might hold your own. ENNIS, surprised by this torrent of words, clears his throat. ENNIS Sir? The OLD MAN kicks at the tractor tire a time or two, as if irritated it exists. Looks at ENNIS. OLD ~WJ Where was you raised, bud? ENNIS Uh, Sage. OLD MAN Why, that ain't hardly in Wyoming, that's nearly to Utah. You ain't a damn Mormon, are you? (CONTINUED)    CONTINUED: ( ) ENNIS No, sir. I just never heard a no place called Brokeback.  The OLD MAN points to a long, barren mountain to the no~th, its upper reaches miles away, reaching well above the tree line. OLD MAN Don't vou let that damn Joe Aguirre send you up.there with no twentytwo. Coyotes don't mind a twentytwo. Make sure he gives you a thirtyought. Too much talk for ENNIS, who nods his thanks. Looks up at the mountain as he walks off. EXT: SIGNAL, WYOMING: TRAILER: DAY: The sun is full up, though it is still early. A gentle breeze whistles. ENNIS sits on the steps of a dingy trailer house, a crooked sign above the door says FARM AND RANCH EMPLOYMENT AGENCY. Smokes, waits. Sees an old green pickup with a bad muffler approaching, and ENNIS becomes aware that the muffler is not the pickup's only problem. It coughs, sputters, rattles from several junctures as it pulls into the gravel parking lot of the AGENCY and dies. The driver sits a moment in the driver's seat, then gets out and slams the door of the pickup in disgust, looks at it much as the OLD MAN had looked at the tractor tire. This is JACK TWIST: like ENNIS, a rough country boy with little education, but somewhat different in appearance and attitude, a little less stoic, a little more of a dreamer. More welcoming, appealing, with a quick laugh. Nineteen, not as tall as ENNIS, more compact and muscular, thick, dark hair, worn jeans, bullrider's belt buckle, faded shirt, stubbly beard, straw cowboy hat, boots worn to the quick. Doesn't notice EtrnISthe steps of the trailer house are still in shade. But when he does, he stiffens a little looks at hirnlooks away. Then the two ignore one another completely . EXT: SIGNAL, WYOMING: TRAILER: DAY (L.l,TER): Eight a.m. The wind has picked up considerably. (CONTINUED)  I    ' .. CONTI!IDED: JACK attempts to shave using his rearview mirror, a cent razor and water in a paper cup. Painful work, but keeps at it, scraping away at his stubble. Pickup radio plays Johnny Cash's """"I WALK THE LINE"""". An old white Buick stationwagon races along a street congested with pickups pulling horse trailers. The stationwagon whips into the parking lot, throwing dust over JACK, who hastily concludes his shaving operation. The stationwagon stops about two feet from the steps of the trailer office, as ENNIS jumps up to get out of the way. The driver, JOE AGUIRRE, middleaged, stocky, no fool, hair the color of cigarette ash and parted down the middle, foam dice hanging from the rearview, gets out. Then reaches back in for an oversize container of coffee. JOE glares at ENNIS, then JACK, as he heads for the trailer office door. Neither boy moves. JOE goes inside. in his pockets. Door slams. ENNIS sticks his big raw hands JACK considers checking under his hood. JOE AGUIRRE (sticks his head out the door) If you pair a deuces are lookin' for work, I suggest you get your asses in here, pronto. ENNIS picks up his grocery sack of clothes. Looks over at JACK. Heads inside. JACK follows. The door forcefully slams behind them. INT: TRAILER OFFICE: DAY: CONTINUOUS: Dusty, choky little trailer office. Venetian blinds hang askew, the one desk littered with papers, the Bakelite ashtray filled with butts, only one chair for guests. A pair of binoculars hangs from a nail in the wall behind AGUIRRE'S desk. Neither ENNIS nor JACK sits. ENNIS smokes. In the background, a small, old blackandwhite TV plays a news story about thenPresident Kennedy . JOE AGUIRRE, in his swivel chair, gives them his point of view. (CONTINUED)     CONTINUED: JOE AGUIRRE Forest service got designated campsites on the allotments. Them camps can be , miles from where we pasture the woollies. Bad predator loss if there's nobody lookin' after 'em at night. (drags on a cigarette) What I want ( looks at Ennis) is a camp tender in the main camp where the Forest Service says, but the herder .. (points at Jack)  pitch a pup tent on the Q.T. with the sheep, and he's goin a sleep there. Eat supper, breakfast in camp, but sleep with the sheep, hundred percent, no fire, don't leave no sign. Roll up that tent every mornin' case Forest Service snoops around. ENNIS is balancing a long ash on his cigarette, considers the ashtray which is overflowing onto JOE'S paperwork, finally just taps it into his hand. Phone rings. JOE picks it up. Listens. Frowns. JOE AGUIRRE (cont'd) No. No. Not on your fuckin' life. (hangs up, resumes) Got the dogs, your /, sleep there. Last summer had goddamn near % loss. Don't want that again. You .. (points at Ennistakes him in) ... Fridays noon be down at the bridge with your grocery list and mules. Somebody with supplies will be there in a pickup. JOE stubs his cigarette in the overfull ashtray, grabs a cheap round watch on a braided cord from a box on a high shelf, winds it, sets it, while JACK and ENNIS look on. Tosses it to ENNIS as if he's not worth the reach. JOE AGUIRRE (cont'd) Tomorrow mornin' we'll truck you up to the jumpoff. Picks up the phone. Pauses. Looks at them hard. Awkward: they realize they are dismissed. (CONTINUED) I    . CONTINUED: ( ) Leave. Emns has to stoop to get out the door. EXT: SIGN.'.L, WYOMING: TRAILER: DAY: CONTINUOGS: The door to the trailer slams shut behind them. JACK walks down the three steps outside the trailer. ENNIS stops, stands on the lowest step of the trailer, looks around at the bleak surroundings. JACK smiles, sticks out his hand. A beat. JACK Jack Twist. ENNIS (shakes hands) Ennis. JACK Your folks just stop at Ennis? ENNIS (after a moment) Del Mar. JACK Nice to know you, Ennis Del Mar. Since we' re gonna be working together, I recl:on it's time we start drinkin' together. ENNIS looks at the watch AGUIRRE gave him: WE SEE it's eight thirty. E;;rs nods to JACK. IN'I: BAR: MORNING: The barroon is large and cavernous. All the chairs are stacked upsidedown on the tables. It's empty except for a EA!<TENDER and WAITRESS, both middleaged. The husky Bi'.RTENDER stands behind the bar and stocks bottled beer into the cooler. The skinny, middleaged WAITRESS cleans ashtrays in a sink. ENNIS and JACK enter the dingy bar. Sunlight bursts into the dimly lit room, startling the Bi'.RTENDER and the WAITRESS . ENNIS and JACK wait a moment for their eyes to adjust to the darkness. (CONTINUED)    I CONTIIHJED: BARTENDER (annoyed) v;e ain't open 'til ten. JACK {friendly) Me and my partner here, we got us a summer's worth a drinkin' to do today. Reckon we're gonna need that extra hour. BARTENDER (repeats) Told you ... we open at ten. The WAITRESS glares at the BARTENDER. WAITRESS Aw, lay off 'em, Royce. They're just buttons. ROYCE shrugs. Wl'.ITRESS (cont'dfriendly, too) You boys have a seat. 't . JACK and ENNIS take their seats at the bar. ENNIS lights up a smoke. The WAITRESS finishes drying an ashtray on her apron. Places it in front of ENNIS. WAITRESS Now then, what'll you have? JACK Bud, please. ENNIS Bud. INT: BAR: DAY (LATER): El\'IS and JACK still sit at the bar, each nurses a long neck. ENNIS peels the label from his bottle. A few empties sit in front of JACK. JACK My second year up here. Last year one storm the lightnin' kilt sheep. (shakes his head) Thought I'd asphyxiate from the smell. We need to take plenty of whiskey, for (MORE) (CONTINUED) I    CONTIN'JED: when the lightnin' starts. (drinks) The WAITRESS arrives. Frowns, looks pointedly at Et.fNIS'S bottle, still halffull. WAITRESS (to ENNIS) You drinkin' that beer, or was you plannin' a grow flowers in it?  ENNIS looks err.barrassed, is about to say sonething, but JACK speaks :first. JACK ( to W.>.ITRESS) Tell you w~at, ma'am, you just keep linin'  em up. WAITRESS smiles. Walks off. ENNIS (in a low voice) I ain't got but a buck and some cha~ge . JACK You drink up. I'll worry 'bout the tab. JACK and ENNIS chug their beers, slam the bottles on the bar. Wl,ITRESS returns with two opened beers. WAITRESS That's more like it. WAITRESS gives each boy his fresh beer. Gathers the empties, and leaves. ENNIS What was you say in' 'bout lightnin ? JACK It smoked some sheep. Aguirre got all over my ass like I was supposed to control the weather. (drinks) Beats workin' for my old man. can't please my old man, no way. That's why I took to rodeoin' . (proudly knocks his rodeo belt buckle) Ever rodeo? (CONTINUED)    i CONTINUED: () ENNIS (reserved) once in a while, when I can afford the e:itry fees. JACK You from ranching people? ENNIS I was. JACK Folks run you off? ENNIS (Stiff) No. They run themselves off. one curve in the road in miles, and they miss it. Killed em both. (drinks) Bank took the ranch. Brother and sister raised me, mostly . Jll.CK Shit. That's hard. (yells to waitress) Two shots of whiskey, right quick. . INT: PICKUP TRUCK: NIGHT: JACK sleeps in his old pickup, slumped against the door. ENNIS, in the passenger seat, wide awake, smokes, gazes through the steamed windows into the darkness. INT: PICKUP TRUCK: MORNING: ~E SEE them pull out of Signal in an Agency pickup driven by a short, silent BASQUE. ENNIS looks hungover, holds his head. JACK, though, is sharp and alert. They pass the gas station. ENNIS glimpses the same sour old rr.an, sitting on the tractor tire. BASQUE You boys need to stick close sheep. Don't let 'em stray. your ass, if you do . JACK to them Joe'll have Friend, you worry 'bout the drivin'. We'll worry 'bout the sheep. (COIJTINUED) I     CONTINUED: Tt:ey drive on in silence.

They are higt:, but The bleating of a thousand sheep fills The BASQUE is showing ENNIS how to properly pack a mu::.e. Deftly hitches on two packs, as ENNIS watches. JACK is already horseback. Several blue heelers circle the sheep. BASQUE Only thing, dor. 't ne\,er order soup. (spits) Them boxes of soup are hard to pack. ENNIS Don't eat soup . JACK comes riding up with a blue heeler pup tucked ir.side his coat. ENNIS That horse looks like it's got a low startle point. Might throw you and that pup both. JACK ( cocky) I doubt there's a horse in tjis string that can throw me. Let s get, 'less you wanna stand here and tie knots all day. EXT: BROKEBACK MOUN'l'AIN: DAY: The thousand sheep, the dogs, the horses, JACK and ENNIS and the pack mules slowly flow out above the tree line, into the vast flowering meadows of the mountainside. WE LINGER on this trek for a bit, as the sheep spread out onto the expansive treeless plain, nothing in sight but sky and land, high clouds. The grass waves in the endless, coursing wind . EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: DAY: SUNSET: From a distance, the sound of sheep. (CONTINUED) I    ! ' . COl:TUfcJED: JACK tends the fire. Drinks from a whiskey bottle. ENNIS, thorough and relentless about his chores, finishes setting up the tent. Sits down next to JACK on the edge of the plat:orm as a vast sunset turns the sky orange. Pass a bottle of cheap whiskey back and forth. JACK (bitching) That Joe Aguirre, 'sleep with the sheep, no fire'. Shit. (drinks) Can't wait 'til I got my own sp=ead, won't have to put up with his shit no r.iore. ENNIS I'm savin' for a place myself.

That Joe, he's got no business havin' us do somethin' that's against the rules. EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: DAY: EARLY MORNING: JACK saddles up, in a pale world. The mountain, misted, is the color of smoke, the high, grassy plain invisible. ENNIS cleans the breakfast plates by the fire. JACK mounts his bay mare. She crowhops a little; he keeps her under control. Rides off, ENNIS watching him go. EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: DAY: MONTAGE: A. WE SEE JACK tending the sheep, a blustery day, the wind combing the grass, drawing from the slit rock a bestial groan. B.

ENNIS nods. EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: ENNIS'S CAMP: DAY: :SNNIS sits on the edge of the platform smoking, looks across the great gulf of seemingly endless plain and sees JACK, a small dot moving across a high meadow, as an insect moves across a tablecloth.

EX: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: JACK'S CAMP: NIGHT: JACK, in his dark camp, lit only by moonlight, sees EKNIS as night fire, a red spark on the huge black mass of mountain. EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: BRIDGE: NOON: ENNIS finishes packing the two mules. Steps back, loo~s at the mules, and shakes his head. The BASQUE watches. BASQUE Something wrong? ENNIS Load seems light. Where's the powdered milk 'n the spuds? ( CONTl llUED) I    CONTINUED: B.~SQUE All we had. The BASQUE reads through ENNIS'S current list. BASQUE (not looking up from the list) Thought you didn't eat soup. ENNIS Sick of beans. BASQUE It's way too early in the summer to be sick of beans. ENNIS ignores the BASQUE'S comment. The BASQUE shrugs, gets in his truck. Drives off. J . ENNIS mounts his big rangy buckskin, Cigar Butt, and leads the two mules back up the mountain. EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: DAY: ENNIS atop Cigar Butt, leads the two mules along the trail. Brokeback Mountain looms in the distance, an eterr.al postcard. It is clear ENNIS enjoys the ride, the silence of the high country. Whistles. Rounds a bendCigar Butt balks, spooks, rears up: a small black bear in the middle of the trail, ;;ho, scared, promptly runs off into the woods. startles also ENNIS is thrown, lands hard, rolls on the rocky ground. Cigar Butt races off the trail, pulling the two mules along with him through the trees and the undergrowth, tearing the supply packs, scattering food everywhere. A bag of flour breaks, creating a white cloud. ENNIS sits up. His temple is cut and bleeding profusely, blood runs down his cheek . ENNIS gets up, stiff and angry, following the trail of food the broken bag of flour, a carton of smashed eggsto find his horse and mules. ~o    r EXT: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: CAMP: DUSK: JACK is back from the flock, :~Jngry, looking for ::is meal.

WE SEE E'.mis ride into camp atop cigar Butt, dismount, somewhat obscured by the darkness. JACK is more worried than angry, tries to disguise his concern with indignation. JACK Where the hell you been? Up with the sheep all day, I get down here, hungry as hell and all I find is beans .... Silent, EHNIS walks towards the tent, fire illur.inati:g his face. He sits on a log by the fire. WE SEE the cut en his forehead, gaping now, dried blood covering the whole side of his :ace.

We're gonna have to do somethin' 'bout this food situation. Maybe I'll shoot one a the sheep. ENNIS What if Aguirre finds out? We're supposed a guard the sheep, not eat 'em.

Li carries a large object, wrapped in silk. Yu smiles. YU Mu Bai...It's been too long. LI It has. (he glances around the room) How's business? YU Good. And how are you? LI Fine. An awkward pause. YU Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain. He said you were practicing deep meditation. LI Yes. YU The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you. My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest. LI I left the training early. YU Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything. LI During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about. YU You were enlightened? LI No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back. YU What was it? LI Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon? YU We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking. LI Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me. Li unwraps the object. It is an ancient, astonishingly beautiful sword. YU The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te? LI I am. He has always been our greatest protector. YU I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you. LI Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade. YU You use it justly, you're worthy of it. LI It's time for me to leave it behind. YU So what will you do now? Li doesn't reply. YU Come with me to Peking. You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times. LI First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness. YU Join me once you have finished. I can wait for you in Peking. LI Perhaps. EXT. THE GATE TO PEKING.

He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it. It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it. YU Sir Te! It has brought him as much trouble as glory. Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew. SIR TE All right. I'll act as the sword's custodian. De Lu, the head servant, enters. DE LU Governor Yu has arrived. SIR TE I must change. YU (getting up) You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me. Please accept our thanks. SIR TE Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying. Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter. YU Please, Sir Te, what is it? SIR TE Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something? YU I don't know... SIR TE Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time. YU I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards. SIR TE When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots. Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him. I'll give him an earful! INT.

JEN I was looking for a quiet corner. DE LU I am Sir Te's head servant. And this is another of our guests. INT. TE'S STUDY DAY Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands. JEN It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal! YU The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it. JEN But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful. YU Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's years old. JEN Exquisite! You said it belongs to... YU My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift. JEN Li Mu Bai! The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te? YU You're too young to understand. JEN You're a sword fighter too? Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath. An eerie sound resonates within the study. Jen is even more impressed. YU Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword. JEN Really? Yu puts the sword back in the case. JEN (longingly) It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free! YU Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long. JEN I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way! YU Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is. JEN But you're just like the characters in the stories. YU Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in fleainfested beds... They tell you all about that in those books? JEN You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want. YU So I heard. Congratulations. It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it? JEN You're not married, are you? YU What do you think? JEN No! You couldn't roam around freely if you were. YU You're probably right. Yu studies Jen. The room falls silent for a moment. EXT. SIDE COURT YARD DAY It's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple. Jen is leaving the study escorted by her maid. She turns to Yu for a final goodbye. Yu seems intrigued by the encounter. EXT. SIR TE'S COMPOUND NIGHT Two lighted lanterns are raised up. INT. TE'S STUDY NIGHT Sir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu. SIR TE Go ahead, Governor Yu. Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the sword. He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword. Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword out from its sheath. The sword gives off a luminous blue glow in the dark. SIR TE Two feet inches long. inch wide. The handle is inch deep, . inches wide. Seventenths of an inch thick. With seven rubies missing from the hilt. You can tell the design dates back to before the Chin era. Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty. GOVERNOR YU Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te. SIR TE A sword by itself rules nothing. It comes alive only through skillful manipulation. GOVERNOR YU I see your point. Please continue. SIR TE The Imperial Court isn't the problem. With royalty and officials everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps security tight. But Peking is not like the West. Here, you'll find all sorts of characters. Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order. Don't depend only on the court. Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld can ensure your position. Be strong, yet supple. This is the way to rule. INT. JEN'S ROOM NIGHT A maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then walks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings. Someone knocks and the maid goes to answer the door. MAID Governess... GOVERNESS Let me do it. The maid leaves as the governess enters the room. JEN Please sit. GOVERNESS I've made you silk pajamas. Do you want to change into them? JEN Put them down. GOVERNESS I heard you met Shu Lien today. JEN Do you know her? GOVERNESS She's one of those. Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind. Jen shoots her an angry look. JEN I'll socialize with whomever I please. GOVERNESS Don't invite danger into your father's house. She's about to say something, then thinks better of it. JEN I'm tired now. GOVERNESS Go to bed then. Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon. God knows what the future will bring. JEN It will be just the same. Enough! I'm tired. GOVERNESS Autumn is coming. I'll shut the windows for you. The governess leaves. Jen sits on the side of her bed, thinking. EXT. TE'S COMPOUND NIGHT A wide shot of the compound. A patrol man greets Master Bo, Sir Te's head of security. The place is serene. MASTER BO Chilly, eh? NIGHTMAN Yes, Master Bo. As Bo walks on, shadows rustle in a treetop in the background. EXT./INT. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF TE'S STUDY NIGHT A masked figure silently opens the window and enters the room. It moves swiftly to the sword case, opens it, and wraps the sword. Bo enters, sees the thief, who leaps up to the ceiling. The thief steps over Bo and out into the courtyard. Bo tries to stop the thief, who easily outwits him, jumping onto the roof as Bo yells out. BO Someone help! Stop him! He's on the roof! The sword's been stolen! Stop thief! Stop him! The thief skips a few times and jumps off to a side street. Bo grabs a pole and runs, as gongs begin to sound, alerting people to the theft. People rush outside, Yu Shu Lien among them. EXT. PEKING STREET NIGHT Bo runs through the streets. The thief is nowhere in sight. Suddenly, there are sounds of weapons clashing. Bo hurries towards the source. EXT. AN ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND NIGHT Bo is surprised to see the hooded figure battling with two other fighters Tsai (male, s) and May, his daughter. TSAI It's Jade Fox! MAY We must avenge mother! The hooded figure does a gravity defying flip and soars over a wall, just as Bo arrives. BO Do something! He's getting away! EXT. PEKING ROOFTOP NIGHT The thief runs atop a roof right into Yu. Yu and the hooded figure face off. YU Return the sword, and I'll let you go. The figure just regards her, slightly shifting weight. Yu attacks, but the figure repels her. YU You've been trained at Wudan? The figure answers by leaping to another rooftop. Yu catches up, and resumes her attack with a relentless series of lightningquick blows. EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND NIGHT Bo follows Tsai and May, who are quickly walking away. TSAI You're mistaken. We're just street performers. We were rehearsing. MAY Father! BO You were rehearsing? Who are you trying to fool? May wants to respond but is again cut off by Tsai. They run off. BO Where did that thief go? Bo looks around and discovers he had chased the thief into Governor Yu's compound. BO Governor Yu's house! EXT. ROOF TOP Yu and the Black Figure continue to fight. YU Get down here! Give back the sword! EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S NIGHT Yu slowly gets the upper hand in her fight with the thief. A small arrow cuts across the night and flies toward Yu. She catches it, but the masked figure takes the opportunity to get away. Yu pauses to feel the arrow in her hand, standing in the empty courtyard. EXT. TE'S SIDE ENTRANCE DAY De Lu escorts Yu into Te's. DE LU Sir Te awaits you. INT. TE'S GREAT HALL DAY Men are standing at attention. Bo is giving his account of what happened, as Yu enters. BO I'm sure the thief is in the Yu household. SIR TE How dare you imply? BO But I say SIR TE Enough. The men hustle out. Bo can barely contain his frustration. YU Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword? SIR TE Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this. YU But the sword could be in his compound. SIR TE Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai. EXT. OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND NIGHT Madam Yu is returning from temple. The governess is helping her out of the carriage. Servants are peeling bills off a wall across the street. MADAM YU What is it? MAID Madam Yu, someone's put up posters. A partially torn flyer with the words """"Jade Fox will not escape justice!"""" is seen on the ground. MADAM YU Let me see. GOVERNESS Someone is after Jade Fox. Preposterous, looking for her here! Madam Yu nods and walks inside, as the Governess tosses the flyer away and follows her. A hand scoops up the flyer it is Yu. She studies it, then puts it in her pocket, and moves on. EXT. BRIDGE DAY Bo is searching for the Tsais. The bridge is full of jugglers. But the two are nowhere to be found. EXT. PEKING STREET DAY Bo quizzes a homeless man. BO Where are they? HOMELESS MAN I don't know. I haven't seen them in two days. Bo is about to give up when he looks up and sees May walking quickly into an alley. Bo follows her. EXT. IN FRONT OF TSAI'S HOUSE May walks into a dilapidated house surrounded by a broken down bamboo fence. Bo inches closer and sees May and Tsai oiling their weapons. INT. BO'S ROOM DAY Jen practices calligraphy. The governess is by her side embroidering and throwing occasional glances at Jen. The maid enters. MAID There is a Miss Shu Lien here to see you. Jen stops and looks up at them. GOVERNESS Miss is busy right now. MAID I'll tell her. JEN Show her in. The governess shoots her a look. GOVERNESS This spells trouble. JEN I have a guest. The governess gets up to leave just as the maid shows Yu in. MAID This way please. The governess and Yu exchange quick glances. The governess bows slightly and departs. JEN I've missed you. YU How so? JEN I'm bored. Yu sees the calligraphy. YU You're doing calligraphy? JEN I'll write your name. Just for fun. Jen writes Yu's name with great confidence and swiftness. YU I never realized my name looks like """"sword."""" Jen freezes slightly. YU You write gracefully. Calligraphy is so similar to fencing. JEN Maybe it is. I wouldn't know. The maid enters with tea. JEN Please. YU Thank you for seeing me. I hear your wedding day is near. You must be overwhelmed by the preparations. JEN I'm hardly doing a thing. The less I think of it the better. My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career. YU You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family. JEN Am I? I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read. Like you and Li Mu Bai. I guess I'm happy to be marrying. But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness. YU Do you think so? Let me tell you a story. JEN About you and Li Mu Bai? YU Yes. Did you know I was once engaged to be married? JEN No, really? YU His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng's memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it. But I have never tasted it. JEN Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's. YU I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties. JEN Don't distance us. From now on, let's be like sisters. YU Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage. EXT. YU'S GARDEN DAY The maid escorts Yu out. Yu pauses, looks around, and sees the profile of the Governess peering at her from around a corner. INT. JEN'S ROOM NIGHT Moonlight spills into the room, as Jen rises sleeplessly from bed and looks out the window. A light breeze stirs her hair. The sound of the wind rises, and slowly her face dissolves, into... INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT DAY ...the face of a younger, less sophisticated Jen, as she lets the dry desert air flow through her hair. She sits in a carriage, part of a caravan, with guards on horseback, that is traveling through the spectacular desert. Across from her sits her mother, of whom she is barely cognizant. MADAM YU What a godforsaken place! Can't your father be appointed closer to civilization? Jen... are you listening to me? Jen is still looking out the side of the carriage, at a beautiful mountainside. INT. JEN'S ROOM NIGHT Jen sighs, and turns back toward her bed. EXT. STREET OUTSIDE GOVERNOR YU'S COMPOUND NIGHT Tsai and May have been sitting, hidden in the branches of a tree, watching Jen. TSAI Let's go! They drop down silently and walk away. From another rooftop, Lo looks silently on. EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE NIGHT Tsai and May enter the house. INT. TSAI'S HOUSE NIGHT Inside the tiny house, they discover a hooded figure going through their belongings. Immediately Tsai throws a knife, which rips off the figure's mask revealing Bo. Tsai has another long knife at his throat. TSAI Who are you? BO Wait! I'm a friend! Tsai pauses. INT. TSAI'S HOUSE NIGHT (LATER) May fans a small coalfired grill that is boiling a sizzling pot of vegetable and meatball soup. Her father and Bo are now friendly dinner companions, much to May's delight. TSAI I don't care about your sword. BO Why were you spying on the Yus? TSAI I'm looking for someone. Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district. Jade Fox is a master criminal. I hear she infiltrated the Yus. She must have come with them when they transferred here. But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her. BO This Jade Fox is a woman? TSAI Yes. BO Then leave her to me. TSAI Pardon me, but I doubt you can handle her. My wife was quite a martial arts expert. Jade Fox killed her. So you see, this is personal. Leave her to me. MAY It's ready! (re: the soup) BO I'm ready for anything! Bo fishes into the pot with his chopsticks. May intercepts him with her own chopsticks. MAY Father gets first dip. Tsai stiffens and snaps his chopsticks, not to pick up a meatball but to catch an incoming dart. A dart wrapped with a note. Bo jumps up. TSAI They're gone. MAY What does it say? TSAI """"We'll settle this at midnight on Yellow Hill."""" Good, the fox is out of her hole. INT. TE'S STUDY NIGHT Yu is ushered into the room, to discover Sir Te talking to another man, whose back is to her. SIR TE Shu Lien, look who's here. The man turns around it's Li Mu Bai. EXT. TE'S HALL NIGHT Yu and Li Mu Bai sit together. LI Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu. YU But something is going on at the Yu household. LI What have you discovered? From her sleeve, Yu removes the flyer. Li takes it, his face darkening. LI Jade Fox? Impossible. YU You always suspected she'd fled to the West. LI I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking! YU Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu? LI So I shall avenge my master's death after all. YU Be careful. Sir Te requires discretion. Official business is difficult enough. Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap. LI Did you see who posted it? Yu pauses. YU No. LI It says Jade Fox is hiding at Yu's. On the night of the theft there was a brawl near Yu's. Were you involved? YU It was Bo, Sir Te's man. I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'. LI Have you questioned him yet? YU No, not yet... LI But your men are watching over Yu's compund? YU No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods. LI That's not what I meant. I don't care about the sword. YU What do you mean? Didn't you come back here for it? LI I don't know it was stolen until I got here. YU Then, why did you come? LI Well, we had talked... De Lu enters. DE LU Pardon my intrusion. Master Li, your room is ready. LI Thank you. Please lead the way. EXT. YELLOW HILL NIGHT Tsai, Bo, and May wait under an ancient tree. Bo stifles a yawn. BO The fox doesn't care much for punctuality. Still no sign of her. An old lady struggles up the hill, wearing a floppy hat over her face, holding a cane. The three exchange glances. TSAI Enough! Show yourself. The old woman shrinks in fear, but then throws off her disguise and unveils herself the Governess. FOX Tsai... you dog! You will pay for your stubbornness. BO That's what you think, old witch! TSAI If you surrender now, you'll suffer less. But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead. MAY Father! Let me avenge my mother's death. FOX You'll soon end up like her, you little whore! BO You'll pay for that! A fierce battle begins, the main fighting between Tsai and Fox, with May and Bo getting a stab in occasionally, when the opportunity presents itself. TSAI (to Bo) She's going to paralyze you! Using acupressure, Fox disables Bo. May shoots an arrow at her, but she catches it and flings it back, hitting May. TSAI May! Fox then disables Tsai, but just as she goes for the kill, Li Mu Bai flies down from the treetops and steps between them. FOX Tsai, you filthy mongrel! An ambush! MAY Father, are you all right? Li addresses Fox. LI Wudan should have gotten rid of you long ago. It's been a long time, Jade Fox! You don't remember me... But you should remember my master. You infiltrated Wudan while I was away. You stole our master! Now it's time for you to pay! FOX Your master underestimated us women. Sure, he'd sleep with me, but he would never teach me. He deserved to die by a woman's hand! LI You stole the secrets of Wudan's highest martial arts. But after ten years of training, your moves are still undisciplined. And today, under a Wudan sword... you will die! Li easily brings Fox to the ground. Li raises his sword to the prostrate Fox. A figure masked in black appears next to Fox, sword extended, saving her. FOX Disciple, we'll kill them all! FIGURE IN BLACK Let's go! BO Another one! FOX I must get rid of Tsai! Fox fights Tsai, Bo, and May, as Li addresses the masked figure. LI Who are you? Why is the Green Destiny in your possession? FIGURE IN BLACK What's it to you? LI My name is Li Mu Bai. The Green Destiny is mine. Jade Fox can't be your master. Where did you learn that """"Xuan Piu"""" move? FIGURE IN BLACK I'm just playing around. LI Tell me, who is your master? FIGURE IN BLACK Let's go! FOX We must kill them! Tsai throws his blade at Fox, who catches it and throws it back, hitting him in the head. Fox and the masked figure leap away. May drops to the ground, cradling her dead father's head. Bo kneels beside her. MAY Father! EXT. TE'S DAY Te and a group of his men look down as a cloth is removed from over the body of Tsai. Bo and May stand before them. TE This is Tsai? MAY My father. Police Inspector from Shaan. TE This should be reported to Governor Yu. The victim is an officer. You believe the killer is hiding out in his compound. YU I'd bet my life on it! TE (to Li and Yu) Come with me. He exits the room. INT. TE'S STUDY DAY Te, Li, and Yu are seated. SIR TE This needs to be resolved, and quickly. LI I'll get into the Yu household and get her. I'll ferret out Fox and her gang. YU We must be careful. Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security. Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him. It might get Sir Te in trouble. SIR TE This is a delicate matter. YU Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter? SIR TE What do you have in mind? YU The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs. Sir Te and Li look puzzled. EXT. SIR TE'S GARDEN DAY Yu sits with Madam Yu and Jen. They busy themselves with various items for her trousseau. MADAM YU Madam Te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts. She's being so considerate. YU I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today. MADAM YU I heard Sir Te lost something. And now Madame Te's not feeling well... Jen sits silently reading. YU We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further. MADAM YU That's good. Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing. YU Sir Te knows that even wellmeaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families. MADAM YU But don't be too lenient. YU No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking. MADAM YU A murderer? YU Yes. The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master. Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down. MADAM YU A female criminal! Now that's news! Jen becomes visibly upset. JEN You say she killed a policeman? YU Yes, from the West. He went undercover and and followed her here, MADAM YU Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same. YU I doubt it. This thief... it very unusual... As Yu speaks, she lifts the tea pot to pour Jen some tea. As she finishes speaking, she looks into Jen's face and the pot slips from her hand. Without even looking down, Jen instinctively catches the pot with a lightningfast move. YU ...And most likely smarter than a mere killer. Sir Te and Li Mu Bai walk by. JEN (formal) Greetings, Sir Te. SIR TE Hello, Madam Yu. This is Li Mu Bai, the renowned swordsman. LI Delighted to meet you. Li sizes Jen up. TE Miss Yu is soon to be married. LI Congratulations. EXT. TSAI'S HOUSE NIGHT May opens her door, only to find Bo standing guard. MAY Why don't you come in? BO I'm standing guard. MAY Come in. It's cold. She turns back inside, hesitates, then turns back to him. MAY Come in. We don't have to fear Jade Fox if we're together. EXT. TE COMPOUND NIGHT A still, dark night. EXT. TE'S STUDY NIGHT Something moves in the moonlight. A hooded figure jumps down. Li Mu Bai, who had been hiding in the shadows, comes forward. LI Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword? FIGURE I do as I please. The masked figure lunges away, but Li Mu Bai leaps with incredible speed and grabs the sword from her. LI Where's your master? FIGURE What's it to you? The figure floats away. Li chases after her. EXT. PEKING STREET NIGHT The two fly over houses and bounce off of rooftops, displaying amazing floating skills. INT. ABANDONED MONASTERY NIGHT The figure bounces into an old monastery. Li is already there. LI Had enough flying? You've got potential. You've studied the Wudan Manual but you don't understand it. You need a real master. The figure doesn't respond, but we sense the pride in her eyes. FIGURE Do you think you are a real master? LI Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword. All of it is simply a state of mind. FIGURE Stop talking like a monk! Just fight! LI Then tell me where Jade Fox is. FIGURE On guard! LI Real sharpness comes without effort. EXT. MONASTERY NIGHT The figure leaps into the garden, but again, Li is ahead of her. The figure attacks Li, who uses his agility to evade her. Frustrated, the figure intensifies her attack. The figure, losing composure, attacks wildly. Li gets even more elusive, using a branch to repel her. LI No growth without assistant. No action without reaction. No desire without restraint. Now give yourself up and find yourself again. There is a lesson for you. Li now holds the stick to her mask, gently raising it slightly. FIGURE Go ahead. LI Why should I? You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness. FIGURE Why do you want to teach me? LI I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets. FIGURE And if I use them to kill you? LI That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good. Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you. The figure's eyes cloud with tears. FIGURE Wudan is a whorehouse! Keep your lessons! The figure swirls and takes off, leaving a rueful Li standing alone in the monastery. INT. JEN'S ROOM NIGHT Jen slips in through the window. She pulls off her mask, as she spots the Governess/Fox sitting and sewing. FOX You're home late... or should I say early? JEN Why are you still here? You killed a policeman. You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family. FOX They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule. JEN I'll never live as a thief! FOX You're already a thief. JEN That was just for fun. How can I leave? Where would I go? FOX Wherever we want. We'll get rid of anyone in our way. Even your father. JEN Shut up! FOX It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it? JEN I owe you nothing. FOX Yes, you do! You are still my disciple. Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few blows. Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's pressure points, disabling her. Jen pushes her across the room. JEN You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols! FOX I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details! JEN You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain. You know... you've gone as far as you can go. I hid my skills so as not to hurt you. FOX If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me. JEN Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was . You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu. But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened! Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from. FOX Believe me, I've a lesson or two left to teach you! Fox exits. EXT. GOVERNOR YU'S GATE DAY The Governess leaves, a small sack over her back. EXT. TE'S COURTYARD DAY Li practices fluently with Green Destiny in hand, beautifully at ease with the weapon. He spins around to find Yu standing in the doorway. YU The sword is back... are you happy? Li smiles. LI I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it. YU But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te. LI True. But I must borrow it for one last mission. Jade Fox must die at its edge. Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl? YU My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's. LI You did your job well. But, this girl... I saw her last night. YU I knew she would intrigue you. LI She needs direction... and training. YU She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry. LI That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple. YU But Wudan does not accept women. LI For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon. YU It's not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object. LI I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues. YU I wish there were something more I could do to help you. LI Just be patient with me, Shu Lien. INT. JEN'S ROOM NIGHT Jen is asleep. A noise awakens her. Lo opens the window and sneaks in right into the point of Jen's waiting sword. Jen's sword drops to the ground. JEN Lo? LO Jen! Lo grabs her by the wrist. JEN You shouldn't have come. LO With all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here. I can't wait any longer. I was wrong to let you go. Come back with me. You'll be happy in the desert. You'll be free there. Jen turns back to him and rests herself briefly in his arms again. JEN You've been looking for me all this time? FLASHBACK: FOUR YEARS EARLIER INT./EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT DAY Jen holds up a comb, with daylight shining through it. Jen admires the piece, her most prized possession. Madam Yu sits opposite her. MADAM YU Jen... stop playing with it. Jen looks out over the desert, as the wind picks up and the sky darkens. JEN I won't break it. EXT. CARRIAGE/MONGOLIAN DESERT DAY Lo and a group of armed bandits descend on the caravan. GUARD A It's Dark Cloud! Dark Cloud is coming! His warning is useless. From Jen's pov, we see the guards slaughtered in a hail of arrows and swords. MADAM YU Lower the shade, don't let them see you! DARK CLOUD (LO) Don't touch the women! Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints. Lo approaches the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand. She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse flails beside him. She looks up to see the gang of bandits already making their escape on horseback. LO Let's go! EXT. DESERT DAY Jen and Lo ride across the desert floor at breakneck speed. LO Come get your comb. She tries to jab him with the lance, but he grabs it and flings her off her horse. LO Hurry back to your mother. Lo rides on as she charges after her horse. EXT. DESERT BLUFF DAY A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up, keeping a respectable distance. They notice her and rise as she dismounts. One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few feet away. In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and knocked his nose into his face. He crumples to the sand. The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances, and charge her at once. In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or dragging their fallen comrades back. Lo calls out and stops the fight. LO She's mine. EXT. DESERT DAY Lo and Jen ride, if not sidebyside, then parallel, about feet apart. Their pace has slowed considerably. In fact, they're dead tired. LO Let's stop a moment. JEN Give it back! LO (shouting a bit) You're tired. You need rest. Your horse needs water. There's a creek up here. He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed. LO Well, there used to be! What's your name? I'm Lo. The Hans call me Dark Cloud. I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning. JEN My comb! She kicks him. They fight ferociously until Lo, exhausted, collapses. She kicks him a few times, then collapses too. INT. CAVE DAY Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of animal fur. She sits up with a start and checks her clothes. Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave. Next to her are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp arrows. She quickly grabs one of the arrows. LO If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow. Great for hunting wild chicken. They're delicious. Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but her legs betray her and she falls. LO You need to eat, understand? Then you'll have the strength to fight. Understand? He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac. He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she starts to wolf it down. LO You're eating too fast. Slowly. EXT. CAVE DAY Lo walks out into a barren mountain landscape. A chicken roasts over a fire. Lo whistles. Jen appears suddenly with a rock and knocks it over his head. Lo passes out as Jen scurries away. EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE AND DESERT DAY Jen tries to find her way among the treacherous stony terrain, her lips chapped and fingers bloody and blistered. But soon she passes out. INT. CAVE NIGHT Jen again awakes inside the cave. Lo tries to feed her some water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to find that her legs and hands are tied up. LO You've got quite a temper. It's better this way. JEN You coward! LO Still in a bad mood? At least you're speaking. What's your name? Jen spits at Lo. LO I didn't think the Hans had names like that. Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness. In the flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows. Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift bathroom a waterfilled cavity serves as a tub. He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and dishevelled body. He comes over and unties her. LO Relax. If I had wanted to, I would already have done it. You must be dying for a bath. Fresh water's hard to get here. But I managed to bring some up. You can wear my clothes when you're done. They're clean. Don't worry. I'll sing, so you'll know where I am. After the bath, you'll be calmer. Jen nods and the bandit releases her. He starts to sing as he walks out. Jen waits until the sound recedes before closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit. While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud rendition of a tribal song. Lo apparently doesn't remember all the lyrics, and lalas his way through more than a few passages. Jen smiles. INT. CAVE NIGHT Jen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles from the soles of her feet. LO No more hitting on the head! All this trouble for a comb? JEN It's mine. It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand. LO Not true. I can use it to pick fleas from my horse. JEN By the way, I'm a real Manchurian. LO I'm sorry... I guessed wrong. I though you were a Han. JEN Give me back my comb. LO I don't take orders from anyone. JEN Give it back. Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a little blood from his chest. Furious, Lo lunges at her and they tussle briefly. Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and the scuffling becomes more like foreplay. Violence turns into unleashed passion. EXT. DESERT OASIS DAY Lo and Jen ride across the desert. Jen holds tightly to him. EXT. CAVE NIGHT Lo and Jen lie in the bath together. LO When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars. I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan. I used to look for stars alone. I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them. I've been riding in the desert ever since. JEN And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit. He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb. Lo pauses. LO Out here, you always fight for survival. You have to be part of a gang to stand a chance. Slowly, your gang becomes your family. All that Dark Cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier. JEN So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars. LO I am a man. And now I've found the brightest star of all. EXT. DESERT DAY Lo sees uniformed men through his binoculars. LO Your father's men are looking for you. Jen doesn't respond. EXT. DESERT DAY Lo and Jen ride through a mountain pass. EXT. CLIFF DAY Lo and Jen stand at the crest of a cliff. Lo looks over, viewing the desert valley below, as Jen joins him. They see a troop of uniformed men riding by in the distance. LO Your father's men are still looking for you. They're still out there, circling closer. JEN Let them look. LO It is trouble for me. Jen bites her lip. JEN Don't send me back! LO You must decide. You might get tired of this life. You might begin to miss your family. If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too. She would miss us. Jen... I want you to be mine forever. I will make my mark on the world. I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend. Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish. Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped. He didn't die. He wasn't even hurt. He floated away, far away, never to return. He knew his wish had come true. If you believe, it will happen. The elders say, """"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""" INT. TENT DAY Jen and Lo kiss. Jen takes the jade comb out of her hair and presses it into his palm. Jen starts to cry. They embrace. JEN Keep it safe. Return it to me when we are together again. LO I will. JEN (smiling painfully) If you don't, I'll come after you. And I won't let you off so easy. EXT. TENT DAY Jen quietly walks out and stands sadly in the early morning light. End of flashback. INT. JEN'S ROOM NIGHT LO Wherever I went, someone always recognized me. I really tried. Later, I heard you came to Peking. I was afraid I'd never see you again. So I came. I can't let you marry. Jen is about to respond when a servant's voice is heard from outside the door. JEN (whispering) Go. LO Jen... JEN (through her tears) Don't ever come back. Lo hovers at the window frame. LO So it's over? Jen pauses. JEN Yes. Lo thrusts a small object in her hand. He lifts his legs through the window, and drops out of sight, just as Jen's door is opened from the hall. MAID We heard noises. JEN It was just a cat. The maid pauses, then dutifully exits, closing the door. Jen opens up her palm; gasping, she sees the comb that Lo has given her. EXT. WEDDING PROCESSION DAY The noise and color of a wedding procession. A marching band heralds the occasion, as throngs of onlookers fight to get a glimpse of the groom, Gou Jun Pei, who trots by on a handsome white horse. INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE DAY Jen's head is completely covered in red cloth, as she rides silently in the bride's carriage. EXT. BALCONY OVERLOOKING WEDDING PROCESSION DAY Li and Yu watch the festivities from a balcony of the city gate. YU You think Jade Fox will show up? LI She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself. We'll keep our eyes open. Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl. INT. WEDDING CARRIAGE DAY A small arrow flies into the carriage. Jen calmly lifts the red cloth from her face and pulls the arrow out of the panelling inside the carriage. We hear Lo's voice from outside the carriage, but Jen doesn't seem to notice. LO (v.o.) Jen! Come with me! You're mine! Lo runs wildly into the crowd. LO Come with me to the desert! Jen! Come with me to Xin Jiang! The guards surround Lo, but he escapes. EXT. BEIJING STREET DAY Lo leaps and lands right in front of Li Mu Bai, his fingers pressed against Lo's neck. Yu comes running around the corner and sees them. LI Where is Jade Fox? Yu jumps in and pushes Li away. YU (to Lo) Come with me! Hurry! INT. CITY OUTSKIRTS DAY Lo sits dejectedly, having told his story to Yu and Li, who look him over. YU (to Lo) You thought she'd give it all up and go back West with you? LO She's mine. LI Either way, you are no good to her dead. With the Gou and Yu clans hunting you, you'll soon be in their hands. LO I don't care anymore. LI If you truly loved her, you wouldn't say that. YU Don't you want to see her again. LI All right. I'll write you an introduction. Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me. LO All right. EXT. TE COMPOUND NIGHT Yu and Li enter, as other men and women race through the compound, a sense of panic in the air. Yu gives Li a look. Li shrugs. INT. TE'S HALL NIGHT A crowd, including Li and Yu, stand by as Te opens the empty sword case, his voice rising. SIR TE When will this end? They take it, they put it back, they take it again. My home is turning into a warehouse. Bo bursts into the hall, bows to Te. TE Speak! BO Jen has run away! Gou found the wedding chamber empty. Governor Yu requests your assistance. You know the Giang Hu underworld. He wants to find her, and keep her from harm. LI Sir Te, leave this to us. Don't worry. INT. TEA STALL DAY Jen arrives at the tea stall. She places her sword on the table, which catches the attention of a couple of Giang Hu martial arts characters sitting nearby. WAITRESS What can I serve you? As the waitress turns to leave, Jen grabs her by the arm. JEN The cup is dirty. The flustered waitress apologizes and takes the cup away. The men approach Jen. GANGSTER A Hello. What is your name? JEN (without lifting her eyes) Long. GANGSTER B It's young Master Long. My apologies. I'm Iron Eagle Sung and this is my brother in arms, Flying Cougar Li Yun. What brings you to Huai An, and where are you headed, Master Long? JEN Anywhere there's action. The two men exchange glances. GANGSTER A In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance. JEN Don't bother. GANGSTER A You don't seem to understand. JEN So what if I don't? GANGSTER B We have ways of helping you understand. The two pull out their weapons which are immediately chopped into scraps by Jen. GANGSTER A (stunned) Are you related to Li Mu Bai? JEN He is my defeated foe! EXT. WOODS DAY Li and Yu pass a cup back and forth as Bo tends to the horses in the background. YU Have some tea. As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch. Embarrassed, Li pulls back. LI Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence. My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real. YU Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real? LI Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it. Li takes Yu's hand and presses it to his face. LI Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble. YU To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger. LI You're right, but I don't know what to do. I want to be with you... just like this. It gives me a sense of peace. Li Mu Bai smiles. INT. STAR RESTAURANT DAY Jen walks upstairs. A waiter greets her. WAITER Please follow me. JEN I want a clean room. WAITER We have plenty. Your order? Jen again sets her sword on the table as she sits down. JEN Steamed whole cod, bitesize meatballs, a little starchy, but keep the sauce light, shark fin soup, mixed vegetables, and some warm wine. WAITER (dazed) I have to order from a bigger restaurant. JEN Hurry then. The waiter gauges Jen for an instant before bouncing off to place the orders. Jen checks her pouch and sees there's not much money left. A large group of Giang Hu characters enters. They survey the restaurant and quickly find Jen upstairs. GIANG HU A That's him. MI BIAO I am Iron Arm Mi. I heard a true master has arrived. I have come to seek a lesson. Jen ignores him. MI BIAO (bristles) You asked for it! Mi charges and attacks Jen, who is still sitting sipping tea. Jen barely lifts a finger and disposes of Mi with a poke at a sensitive pressure point. This provokes a reaction from the other men. JEN What kind of Iron Arm are you? FLYING MACHETE CHANG You have amazing technique! I am Flying Machete. Are you related to Southern Crane? JEN Southern Duck? I don't eat anything with two feet. Who could remember such longwinded names? GOU JUN SIHUNG Li Mu Bai is your defeated foe, and you don't know his master, Southern Crane? JEN Who are you? GOU JUN SIHUNG I'm Shining Phoenix Mountain Gou. JEN (furious) Gou? I hate that name. It makes me puke! Too bad you're named Gou. You'll be the first to feel my sword today. Jen leaps up and dives into battle. The men all use different kinds of weapons, but they all succumb to the powerful Green Destiny. MONK JING Hold it! Don't you know Monk Jing? JEN A monk, in a place like this? You need a lesson! MONK JING Who are you? She smiles, and leaps again into action after unsheathing the Green Destiny. JEN Who am I? I am... I am the Invincible Sword Goddess. Armed with the Incredible... Green Destiny. Be you Li or Southern Crane... lower your head... and ask for mercy. I am the desert dragon. I leave no trace. Today I fly over EuMei. Tomorrow... I'll kick over Wudan Mountain! Jen is in a frenzy, slashing and maiming as she speaks. INT. STAR RESTAURANT DAY Yu and Li are surrounded by the variously bandaged men who battled with Jen. FLYING MACHETE CHANG We politely asked for a friendly match, but she showed no respect, and attacked us. Everyone came by to teach her a lesson. MI BIAO Her sword was just too powerful. MONK JING I've traveled everywhere, but never met anyone so uncivilized. SHINING PHOENIX MOUNTAIN GOD (heavily bandaged) She kept accusing me of being Gou Jun Pei's brother. Who is this Gou, anyway? YU Her husband. The men all nod their heads. EXT. OUTSIDE HWAI AN DAY Li and Yu ride together. LI (to Yu) We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in. YU What about you? LI I'll look around and catch up later. YU Not a bad idea. Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters. Yu takes a fork off the road. Thunder can be heard in the darkening sky. EXT. SUN COMPOUND DAY A group of security men are practicing Kung Fu in the front yard of Sun Security. They stop when Yu enters. SECURITY MAN A Mistress, you're back. YU It's you! How's everything here? CAPTAIN Fine. You've been gone a while. YU Yes, and I leave again tomorrow. Your wife was due? AH WAI Yeah, a baby girl. YU Good! AH WAI I'll be happy if she's half as strong as you. YU Mrs. Wu... AUNT WU You're back! YU How's the arm? Still sore? AUNT WU Much better. You've been gone so long. YU Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night. AUNT WU (excited) I'll go and make up his room! Aunt Wu hustles out. Yu goes into her own room. INT. HALL OF ANCESTRAL WORSHIP Yu lights incense for her former fiancH Meng. Hearing something, she turns to see a dishevelled Jen standing outside downstairs. JEN Sister Shu Lien... INT. YU'S ROOM DAY Yu eases her guard, then opens a drawer, and takes out some clothes. Jen, wearing just white underclothing, sets herself on the edge of Yu's bed. Yu brings over the clothes. YU Here you must be in proper attire. JEN I'm just borrowing some clean clothes. I'm not staying. YU I'll give them to you. JEN I was just passing by and wondered how you were. Jen tries to hide her anxiety but finally breaks down on Yu's shoulder in tears. JEN You, sister... YU Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like. If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice. You can run from marriage, but not your parents. JEN They forced me to marry! YU Go back to them first. Then you can decide about Lo. JEN You know about Lo? YU He really loves you. Come back to Peking with me. We'll find a solution. JEN Where is he now? YU Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain. JEN You're working together to set me up! I'm leaving! YU How dare you accuse us? I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family. And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt. Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him. We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine! JEN What do I care? You were never a real friend anyway. But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy? Jen gets up to leave. Yu intercepts her. YU Put the sword down! Jen jumps out. INT. YUAN COURTYARD DAY Jen soars out to the front courtyard where the guards are still practicing. They raise their weapons at the sight of an intruder. YU (calling out) Jen! Jen greets Yu with the Green Destiny. YU Everyone out. Shut the doors. The men leave. YU Fine... the friendship is over. Yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and begins her battle with Jen. Yu uses every weapon that's available against Jen but none are any match for the Green Destiny. After slicing through another set of Yu's weapons, Jen looks admiringly at the Green Destiny in her hands. YU Don't touch it! That's Li Mu Bai's sword. JEN Come and get it if you can. YU Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing. JEN Don't be a sore loser. Go ahead. Take your pick. I'll wait. Go ahead. Yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks. Just as the Green Destiny slices it in half, Yu holds the broken blade at Jen's neck. She pauses before hurting Jen, then pulls back. YU Give me the sword. Jen, taking advantage of Yu's trust, slices her arm. JEN Take it! Yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as Li Mu Bai jumps in. LI (enraged) Stop it! You don't deserve the Green Destiny. JEN Not another lecture! On guard! LI Let's end this here. JEN Only the sword will settle this. Jen soars up to the rooftop, with Li right on her tail. EXT. LAKE DAY Jen floats over the lake, Li close behind. EXT. BAMBOO FOREST DAY Jen runs into a sea of bamboo. She appears to have lost Li but is not slowing down. Her white clothes are now stained with blood and mud. The wind had picked up and every breeze sounds like an air attack by Li. The two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin their dances and dodges. They glance off bamboos and each other while staying afloat. Finally Jen lands on the same stick of bamboo as Li. The two hold their positions for a while, as the bamboo bends. LI I only let you go because I wanted to see the real you. Jen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely. JEN What do you know about a true heart? Li suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree. The bamboo straightens up and throws Jen toward the ground. Jen quickly pulls herself up and charges at Li. Jen chases after Li, into a clearing, out of the bamboo forest. EXT. RIVER DAY Jen finally catches up to Li, who is standing on a rock about a few feet wide amid the rapids. Jen vaults onto the rock and scuffles with Li. Jen loses her balance. JEN What do you want? LI What I've always wanted, to teach you. JEN All right. If you can take back the sword in three moves, I'll go with you. Li takes the sword back. JEN Give it back! LI Kneel! JEN Never! LI Then you have no use for the sword. Li throws the sword into the rapids. Jen dives in to retrieve it. He follows Jen downstream by hopping from one rock to another. Jen recovers the sword but is herself drowning. Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the rapids and fishes Jen out. Jade Fox carries the unconscious Jen away. Li gives chase, but loses them. INT. ABANDONED FACTORY DAY It's raining. Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine paste and then dips a needle in the paste. She burns the needle point, causing a blue smoke. She lights some incense and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious. FOX Sooner or later, they'd drag you back to Peking. Your parents will never accept you again. But why go home? We've gone this far, we won't stop now. You'll always be my lady. At last, we'll be our own masters. We'll be happy. That's the most important thing. All we have left is each other, right? Lie down and rest. Jen is too weak to respond. Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny. EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY DAY Fox scurries ahead in the rain. Her eyes catch something, but she keeps moving. INT. YUAN COMPOUND DAY Aunt Wu finishes bandaging Yu. AUNT WU She's crazy. You should have killed her. YU I didn't have the heart. AUNT WU Well, Li Mu Bai can do it. Yu senses movement at the window. Looking out, she sees Jade Fox in the distance. INT. ABANDONED FACTORY DAY Jen wakes up, flushed from fever. She takes a sip from a cup of water it's empty. She tosses the cup, gets up, and walks into the rain. EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY DAY Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the raindrops. Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li standing there. Jen limps towards him while mumbling. JEN Is it me or the sword you want? Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes. LI You've been drugged! Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner. INT. ABANDONED FACTORY DAY Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to. LI Where is Jade Fox? Jen gestures that she doesn't know. Yu and Bo enter. Yu looks at Jen. YU What happened? LI Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here? YU We followed Jade Fox. Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's direction. Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all, sending them flinging hither and thither. Fox shows herself. Li attacks her. She falls back, bleeding to death. LI And so you die. Li touches his neck. FOX And so shall you! Li pulls a single needle from his neck. YU A poisoned needle! FOX You deserve to die, but the life I was hoping to take... was Jen's. Ten years I devoted to you. But you deceived me! You hid the manual's true meaning. I never improved... but your progress was limitless! You know what poison is? An eightyearold girl, full of deceit. That's poison! Jen! My only family... my only enemy... Jade Fox dies. YU You can't die! Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die! JEN She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart. LI My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote. YU That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this? JEN The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you. LI All right. Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can. YU (takes the comb from her hair) Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu. She'll help you. Hurry! JEN Spare your energy. I'll be back! EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY NIGHT Bo is burying Fox in the rain. EXT. YUAN COMPOUND NIGHT The guards surround Jen. She pushes past them. JEN Where is Mrs. Wu? Aunt Wu comes running out. AUNT WU Stop it! Jen pulls out Yu's comb. JEN Shu Lien told me to show you this. AUNT WU Let her in. INT. ABANDONED FACTORY NIGHT Yu sits across from Li, whose pose is almost meditational, eerily calm. YU Mu Bai, hold on. Give me some hope... LI Shu Lien... YU Save your strength. LI My life is departing. I've only one breath left. YU Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath. Do not waste it... for me. LI I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you. Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit. Yu cries. She kisses him lightly. He closes his eyes. EXT. PATH DAY As the sun rises, Jen rides speedily, clutching the medicine in her hands. INT. ABANDONED FACTORY DAY Li is in Yu's arms. They're holding hands. The sun shines in. Yu slowly releases Li's stiff fingers he is dead. Jen is at the door. JEN He's gone? Bo peeks over Jen's shoulder. Yu rises and picks up Green Destiny. Jen kneels. Yu raises the sword, but doesn't kill her. YU Bo... please take this sword back to Sir Te. He takes the sword from her. YU (to Jen) Now you must go to Wudan Mountain. Lo awaits you there. Promise me one thing, whatever path you take in this life... be true to yourself. EXT. WU TAN TEMPLE DAY Jen climbs up toward the temple, finally reaching the temple gate, and sees Lo standing there. He runs to her. She greets him. INT. WU TAN TEMPLE MAGIC Jen and Lo make love. INT. WU TAN TEMPLE DAY Lo wakes up to find the jade comb on the pillow beside him, Jen gone. EXT. WU TAN MOUNTAIN DAY Lo catches up to Jen, who stands on a bridge. The gorges below are shrouded in clouds. She looks back at him. JEN Do you remember the legend of the young man? LO """"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."""" JEN Make a wish, Lo. Lo pauses. LO (closing his eyes) To be back in the desert, together again. Jen smiles, turns, and leaps into the clouds. They seem to catch her gently, before she disappears into them. Lo remains standing, a smile on his face, tears rolling down his cheeks. THE END. All movie scripts and screenplays on Screenplays for You site are intended for fair use only. """

EMPIRE STORAGE EVENING The metal storage door rises, revealing Fern, now in her sixties, and the snowy landscape behind her. She digs through dusty boxes and trunks, scanning for lucky items to bring with her. A stack of plates with autumn leaf patterns and a rusty camping lamp make the cut. She loads them into Vanguard, a white Ford cargo van, rusty and muddy, parked in the snow. Fern keeps searching when she pulls out a mans blue work coat thats too big for her. She holds it to her face like an old friend and breathes it in. Holding back tears. Later, she pays storage fee to GAY, seventies, the storage owner and an oldtimer. They give each other a hug. GAY You take care of yourself out there. EXT. ROAD NORTHERN NEVADA EVENING Vanguard travels across an endless, frostbitten landscape. . EXT. ROAD SIDE LATER Fern, shivering, squats at the side of the icy road, urinating, while looking for incoming cars. INT. ROAD NORTHERN NEVADA DUSK Highway stretches out under a dark and cloudy sky.

DESERT ROSE RV PARK NIGHT Vanguard pulls into a spot. The engine rattles to a standstill and the lights turn off. INT. VANGUARD MOMENTS LATER Fern closes the curtain dividing the drivers seat and the back of the van. She turns on a small desk lamp and reveals the warm and cozy DIY interior her home on wheels. A pot of mac and cheese bubbles on a portable stove. Fern adds a can of stewed tomato and seasons it. She pours it onto the autumn leaf plate she brought from storage and eats, staring blankly out of the dark window. She does dishes with a spray bottle and carefully wipes every one clean and stores them away. She uses her five gallon bucket and cat litter for a pee. She goes to bed. A red Santa light glows beside her. EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE NEXT MORNING The giant Amazon sign looms above. Fern approaches briskly in the morning chill. INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE SECURITY LINE MORNING Fern lines up with SEASONAL WORKERS. Faces of all types, some tired and others excited. Fern sees a someone she knows AL, a man in his fifties. She nods and he nods back. AL Seems like more every year. INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE DAY The sound in the massive factory is bone rattling. Futuristic looking machineries and the shelves stretching all the way to the towering ceiling. Fern marches down long corridors, pushing a stower cart. . . She talks to herself as she matches items and packs boxes. She works with LINDA MAY, sixtyfive with long gray hair, wearing an orange blazer that reads Ambassador, Ask Me. Linda is warm and helpful. The kind of friend you want to have on the road. EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE BACK DAY The towering warehouse stands alone in the open desert. Large delivery trucks are lined up against the building. Fern lights a cigarette and hands Linda May one. LINDA MAY I quit. FERN What?! LINDA MAY I know. Fortythree years. Wasnt as hard as I thought. FERN I salute you, Linda May. LINDA MAY Well, I had to. Doctor said I have macular degeneration in my right eye. FERN Oh shit. LINDA MAY Couldve been worse. FERN What can you do? LINDA MAY Eat healthier, exercise. Definitely no smoking. Fern quickly puts her cigarette out. LINDA MAY (CONT'D) Oh, I was enjoying that. . . FERN (fans the air) No, no. LINDA MAY I think I found land, Fern. FERN Really?! Where? LINDA MAY Douglas, Arizona. Right on the Mexico border. Its four acres in the desert. And I just put down the deposit. FERN Nice! LINDA MAY Yeah. Real nice. Well, I havent actually seen the land in person but the pictures on Craigslist looked real nice. FERN (worried) Linda May! LINDA MAY Fern! Im taking a leap of faith! Its now or never! FERN (thinking) Valid point. The other day I looked in the mirror and I saw my mother. LINDA MAY (laughs) Exactly. I look into the mirror and I see my grandmother. EXT.

Brandy walks away with Audrey, while Mackenzie lingers. MACKENZIE Hey, Mrs. M... we went to Burning Man for field trip this year. FERN Finally! . . MACKENZIE Right?! Well, we went before it started. They gave us ice cream and we got to write our names and a message on a piece of wood, and they put the wood on top of that big temple thing they built and then they burn it on the last day. FERN Nice. What did you write on yours? MACKENZIE I wrote that I wish we still lived in Empire and all my friends that moved away are all moving back. Fern smiles at Mackenzies innocent hopefulness. FERN You like your new school? MACKENZIE Its OK. FERN I bet youre still the smartest kid. MACKENZIE Yeh, kinda. FERN You remember anything we worked on when I tutored you? MACKENZIE Uh, yes... (thinking hard) Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow/ And all our yesterdays have lighted fools/ The way to dusty death/ Out, out, brief candle! Moved, Fern shakes Mackenzies hand.

A moose family on a river in Idaho. Big white pelicans landing just six feet over my kayak on a lake in Colorado. Or... coming round a bend of a cliff and finding hundreds and hundreds of swallow nests on the wall of the cliff. And the swallows flying all around, reflecting in the water so it looks like Im flying with the swallows. And little babies are hatching out. Egg shells are falling out of the nest and landing on the water right next to me, these little white shells. And... it was just so awesome, Fern! I felt I had done enough. My life was complete. I felt like if I were to die right then, it would be OK. How many people can say that? Fern smiles. Not many. EXT DESERT EVENING Swankie shows Fern how to rock hunt under the orange sky.

I would sit there at night and I would want to put my thumb down on that morphine drip just a little longer... so I could let him go. Swankie considers Ferns confession. FERN (CONT'D) Maybe I shouldve tried harder, you know, so he couldve have gone sooner without all that pain... SWANKIE Maybe he didnt want that. Maybe he was trying to stay with you for as long as he could. (beat) Im sure you took good care of him, Fern. FERN I did. Fern smiles a little and keeps on cutting Swankies hair. When its over, Swankie covers her now cleanshaven head with an overly colorful floral hat. SWANKIE Do you like my hat? I bought it for two dollars.

Before Fern can protest, Swankie climbs into her van, the floral hat on her head and her arm still in the sling. SWANKIE (CONT'D) Take care, Fern! See you down the road! Swankie waves and drives away. Fern stands there for a long time, watching the white van rattle towards the horizon. INT. OASIS BOOK STORE NIGHT.

FERN (CONT'D) I am houseless. Not homeless. There is a difference. DOLLY There is.

I tell them youre traveling all over the country, having a great time. FERN Its not like that. Its not some great adventure. I just dont want to be comfortable anymore. I want to take a risk and try something different... What? . . Dolly is smiling to herself. DOLLY Oh Fern, thats what you always want. Its always whats out there thats more interesting. You left home as soon as you could. You married Beau when you only knew him for a few months. And you dropped everything and moved to the middle of nowhere with him. Even after Beau passed away, you still stayed in Empire. I just dont get it. You couldve left, did something with you life, or met someone FERN This is why I dont want to come here. Dolly knows she has hit a nerve. She softens. DOLLY Ive never said this to you before. Maybe I should have... Youve always been the eccentric one growing up.

DEREK You let Noodle sell his jewelry there, didnt ya? FERN Yep. DEREK Would you like a beer? FERN Ok. Ill trade you for a sandwich. DEREK Right on. They make the exchange. DEREK (CONT'D) Its cold. You should sit down by the fire. FERN (considers) Ok. Why not. She sits down. Its nice and warm. DEREK You gave me a lighter back in quartzite. FERN You still have it? DEREK No, thats long gone but I do have this for ya. Derek takes out a silver lighter cover, with a brown stone incased in it. He offers it to Fern. DEREK (CONT'D) I want you to have it. . . FERN (takes it) ...Thanks. Its really beautiful. Whats that stone? DEREK That right there is dinosaur bone. FERN Really? DEREK Really. But I only know what they tell me. FERN Wheres the bus? And your friends? DEREK The bus? Oh, the bus. They went down to New Orleans. FERN I thought you all traveled together. DEREK No... Noodle, Roxy and all of them you saw with the bus, they come to Quartzsite every winter to buy gemstones and then they sell them during their travels for the rest of the year. FERN You dont do that? DEREK No, maam. You gotta be a people person to sell anything. I like helping out on ranches, working with animals. FERN And travel. DEREK And travel. FERN You always been like this? . . DEREK I suppose... Ever since I was little. I never liked what other kids my age did, playing video games and stuff like that. I always just walked the railroad tracks. Once I pass all the trees and forests, I can see it going all the way to the horizon. And I couldnt help it. As soon as I was old enough, I started to jump trains. I like the west. I like being able to see the horizon. Derek lights a cigarette. Fern watches him. FERN ...How old are you? DEREK Twentyone years. FERN Thats... Impressive. Where are your mom and dad? DEREK Back home in Wisconsin. FERN Think they worry about you? Derek avoids the question. FERN (CONT'D) You dont get lonely? Got a girlfriend anywhere? DEREK Well, to be truthful, there is one. She lives up near Lake Superior Small farm. Shes happy with her life there. Im happy with mine. (beat) I write letters to her. FERN Smart man. Letters are good. DEREK But I cant write about anything I reckon shed care about. . . FERN You ever try poems? DEREK Cant say I have. I dont think I know one. Do you know any? FERN How about one I used for my wedding vows when I was not much older than you? DEREK Right on. Mind if I hear it? FERN Aright. Lets see if I can remember it... (beat) Shall I compare thee to a summers day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate/ Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May/ And summers lease hath all too short a date/ Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines. EXT. NEEDLES RURAL AREA NEXT MORNING The early morning of city lights in the distance. Fern watches Derek as he walks away towards the highway. FERN (V.O.) And often is his gold complexion dimm'd/ And every fair from fair sometime declines, By chance or natures changing course undimm'd. Inside Vanguard, Fern opens a binder of old slides. She looks at them through a viewer. A faint light illuminates past memories Images of Fern as a little girl. Her parents and her sister. Family life, summer trips, holidays meals... FERN (V.O.) But thy eternal summer shall not fade/ Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst/ Nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade/ When in eternal lines to time thou growst/ So long as men can breathe or eyes can see/ So long lives this, and this gives life to thee. . . EXT. REDWOODS, CALIFORNIA MORNING The redwoods of northern California. Fern looks up, mesmerized by these ancient giants the tallest living beings on the Earth. EXT. CALFORNIA COAST LATER Vanguard weaves along coastal roads. The Pacific Ocean suddenly appears. The sun a golden orb bursting through sea mist. EXT. DAVES HOUSE MORNING DAYS LATER Fern pulls into the wellkept homestead with a beautiful ranch house surrounded by trees. FERN Woah. She gets out of the van, taking with her a nicelyironed blue jean dress on a hanger and a box of chocolate. Daves van is parked by the bushes. One of the tires is flat. Fern peeks inside. It looks unused and empty. She walks towards the front door. VOICE Fern! Dave comes out in a hurry. DAVE You made it! FERN Yeah. Hi! Dave shows her in through the gate and introduces her to his daughterinlaw EMILY, who is working in the garden. DAVE This is my daughterinlaw Emily. FERN Hi! Here . . EMILY (takes the chocolate) Oh, thanks. So nice to finally meet you. Weve heard so much about you. INT. DAVE'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN DAY Fern walks into the living room and is immediately surrounded with Daves family and friends. DAVE Hey everyone, this is Fern. VOICES Hi Fern! Hello! Welcome! Everyone makes small talk with her. Theres a special effort to make her feel welcome, until the new BABY begins to cry. INT. DAVES HOUSE GUEST BEDROOM MOMENTS LATER Fern recovers for a moment in solitude. She sits on the large bed, in a room that feels abnormally spacious. INT. DAVES HOUSE BABY ROOM LATER The sound of chatting and cooking in the kitchen. Fern folds baby laundry, while Dave entertains the baby. He is good with him. FERN Youve got a flat. DAVE Huh? FERN Your van. One of your tires is flat, Dave. DAVE Oh. Ok. I havent noticed. FERN Because youre staying? DAVE Yeah... . . FERN Good. DAVE I never expected to. Never thought Id spend another night under a roof, but... It was getting pretty lonely out there. FERN You had friends. DAVE Yeah... FERN What about Bob? Youve known him for years. And your friends at RTR? DAVE Yeah... But every time I say bye to them, I dont know If Im going to see them again. And most of the time, I never see them again. Its fine at first... but, a decade of that is something else. Fern knows he is right. She has felt it too. FERN Well, its really nice here. DAVE Yeah. Its not bad... you can stay. FERN Great. Thanks. I gotta do laundry. DAVE (smiles) Yes. Laundry. FERN And a bath. DAVE I meant staying longer, Fern. They have a guest house. Fern gives Dave a look. DAVE (CONT'D) Im serious. . . FERN What do they think about that? DAVE I asked them already. Unexpected, Fern stays quiet. DAVE (CONT'D) I like you. Youre a really good person. You get along with people, for the most part and... I like being around you. Fern didnt expect Daves directness and honesty. She still doesnt know what to say. DAVE (CONT'D) We should drive to the beach tomorrow if the weather is good. (to the baby) What do you think? We should take her to the beach, yeah? Yeah... INT. DAVE'S HOUSE DINING ROOM EVENING A knife carves through a perfectly cooked turkey. The family and friends are gathered having dinner together. The mood is jovial. They pass around the food. Fern helps James with his plate. Dave taps his glass. DAVE I just want to say a little welcome to Fern. To the new one and the old ones too and everyone in between. So welcome Fern. They clink glasses. FERN Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving! Fern chows down the delicious food. She looks around and considers the option of a second chance at a family life. EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE PORCH LATER Fern stands on the porch to have a cigarette. Emily comes out to join her. . . EMILY Could I have one of those? FERN Yeah, sure. Theyre rollups. EMILY Thats OK. Im trying to quit, with the baby and all. But... She lights it and takes a drag, satisfied. FERN Ive given up trying. My friend Linda May quit over night after fortythree years. How about that? They share a laugh. EMILY Im really glad youre here. Dave talks about you a lot. FERN Yeah? EMILY He really likes you. FERN Yeah? (changes subject) You have a nice garden. EMILY It looks a lot better in the summer. Did you have a garden? FERN No. But we had a really great lawn. EMILY Was that hard to do? Empires in the desert, right? I like that name, Empire. FERN When I first went there I couldnt believe how green the whole town was. Everyones got green lawns. Stupid to waste that much water I guess. We even had a public pool and a golf course. . . EMILY Like an oasis. FERN It was. Fern looks towards the dark tree lines in the distance. FERN (CONT'D) Our house was right on the edge of the town. The backyard looked out at this huge open space. Its just desert, desert, all the way to the mountains. (beat) There was nothing in our way. INT. DAVE'S HOUSE BATHROOM NIGHT Fern takes a bath. Bliss. Like its the first time in years. INT. DAVES HOUSE STAIRS LATER Fern carries her laundry down the stairs. She hears music and looks into the study Dave and James are playing the piano together. A simple melody in beautiful synchronicity something father and son had played together many times in the past Fern watches them. She is moved at first, smiling gently. Then, something restless stirs inside of her. She suddenly feels a little short of breath. INT. DAVE'S HOUSE GUEST ROOM THAT NIGHT Fern lies in bed, unable to sleep. She stares at the ceiling. It feels too tall. She gets up and walks out of the dark room. EXT. DAVES HOUSE NIGHT Fern walks out of the house and runs to Vanguard. She climbs in, closes the door and lies under the covers. She touches the ceiling. A moment. She closes her eyes. . . EXT. DAVES HOUSE NEXT MORNING Dark clouds on the horizon. A storm is approaching. Fern stands outside Vanguard and smokes a cigarette. She looks up at Daves house. Its beautiful and tranquil. INT. DAVE'S HOUSE LIVING/DINING ROOM MOMENTS LATER Everyone is still asleep. The house is quiet. Fern looks at the family photos of different generations on the wall. She recognizes a younger Dave with an infant James. She sits down at the empty dining room table and looks around. Silence. A moment passes, Fern gets up, quietly straightens the wooden chair and walks away. EXT. ROAD IN TOWN SAME MORNING Large rain drops on windshield. Fern drives through the quiet town lashed with wind and rain. EXT. OCEAN SAME MORNING Fern walks around the cliff in the heavy wind and rain. She takes off her hat and lets the rain wash down her face. A bird soars on the gale. Alone, fragile, but free. EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE MORNING A WEEK LATER Fern lines up waiting with SEASONAL WORKERS. Same as the previous year, she looks around and notices AL again. He nods at her and she nods back. AL Seems like more every year. INT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE DAY Fern works at the packaging station.

DESERT ROSE RV PARK EVENING DAYS LATER Fern does laundry and solves a jigsaw puzzle alone. EXT. AMAZON WAREHOUSE EVENING A MONTH LATER Fern smokes in the cold air as she facetimes with Linda May. Doug walks by her, shivering. DOUG See you next year, Fern. Happy holidays. FERN You too, Doug. EXT. DESERT ROSE RV PARK VANGUARD NEW YEAR EVE Fern sits on the footstep of Vanguard and lights a sparkler. She smiles watching and adjusts her Happy New Year headband. , another year arrives. INT. VANGUARD EVENING A WEEK LATER Familiar desert landscapes and sunsets flash by the window as Fern arrives back in Quartzsite, Arizona. EXT. DESERT EVENING Fern, with her head down, hikes the desert, looking for a rock. She finally picks up one and feels its rough edges. She looks back The Rubber Tramp Rendezvous camp is in the distance. It has grown in size since last year. EXT. RTR CAMPFIRE NIGHT A group of NOMADS gathered around a campfire to remember Swankie. One by one they toss a stone into the fire. . . Bob Wells walks to the fire and looks down into the flames. BOB WELLS So long, Swankie. See you down the road. He tosses a rock into the flames. Fern stands next and tosses another rock. The embers rise up into the night sky, disappearing amongst the stars. EXT. DESERT NEXT DAWN The first light of the morning sky. Fern and Bob Wells sit together beside his van. FERN Ive been thinking a lot in the past year about why I didnt just leave Empire when my husband Beau died. I couldve left and started a new life sooner. But... I think I somehow made up my mind that if I just packed up and left, it would be as if Beau never existed. You see... Beau never knew his parents and we never had kids. But he loved Empire. He loved being there. He loved his work. Everybody loved him. So I stayed. Same town, same house. Its like my dad used to say whats remembered, lives. (beat) I mightve spent too much of my life just... remembering. Know what I mean, Bob? BOB WELLS I can relate... I rarely talk about my son, but he took his own life five years ago... Like you, I think Ive made up my mind that Im going to be his rememberer. I carry him everywhere I go. I realized I could honor him by helping people. It gives me a reason to go through the day. Some days thats all Ive got. They share an understanding smile. . . BOB WELLS (CONT'D) Out here theres a lot of people our age carrying grief and loss with them. Most of them dont get over it, and thats OK. Thats OK. (beat) One of the things I love most about this life is that theres no final goodbye. Ive met hundreds of people out here and we dont ever say a final goodbye. We just say Ill see you down the road. And I do. Whether its a month or a year or sometimes years, I see them again. I can look down the road and I feel certain in my heart that Ill see my son again. Youll see Beau again and you can remember your life together then. Fern smiles through her tears. She cherishes Bobs words. Theyre a gift. EXT. ROAD DESERT IN NORTHERN NEVADA EVENING Vanguard travels through a vast landscape. Gradually, the familiar snowy high desert near Empire comes into view. INT. VANGUARD EVENING Fern drives, approaching the blue gates of the storage unit. EXT. EMPIRE STORAGE UNIT EVENING Gay, the storage unit owner, and his grandson NICK, load everything from Ferns unit into a pickup. NICK Is that all, Mrs. M? FERN Thats it, Nick. Thank you. You got taller. NICK Yeah? Well, thanks. See ya, Mrs. M. Fern gives Gay her final payment. . . GAY Sure you dont want to keep any of it? Fern looks over at the possessions from her past. They look foreign to her now. FERN No. I wont miss any of it. Yard sale? GAY Sure. But its hard these days. Those Burners, they have money now. They dont stop here to scavenge anymore. Theyve got their big rigs flew in from San Francisco and all over the place. FERN Really. GAY Yeah. Time has changed. EXT. EMPIRE FACTORY EVENING Fern walks towards the factory. She runs into ALBERT and BERNIE, the mines last caretaker and his wife. Albert opens the factory door for Fern. ALBERT Im the last employee. Kind of. I just go around and make sure things arent vandalized. And make sure the llamas are alright. FERN Llamas? ALBERT Well, the company got some goats to keep the lawn weeds down. But the coyotes came and started to get the goats. So, they got two llamas to keep the coyotes away. But the coyotes got the goats anyway. Now those llamas are out of work. They just live here now. . . INT. EMPIRE MINE FACTORY EVENING Albert wipes off the dust on a red button on a control panel. He recounts the last day at the factory. His voice lingers as Fern walks around the empty factory. ALBERT It was around two oclock. All the workers were in here. And when it was time, I pushed the button. Everything just came to a halt. It was quiet in here. Too quiet. The last thing you want to hear in a factory is silence. (beat) I thought of Beau on that day. I wish he was here. We wouldve asked him to stop the production line. It was an honor to be able to do that. The longest running mine in America and he was one of our best. And he was a good friend too. EXT. EMPIRE EVENING Two llamas are wandering the empty street between rows of abandoned houses, munching on lawn weeds. Fern walks past carefully not to disturb them. She passes by the old baseball field, school, church, golf course. All frozen in time. I/E. EMPIRE FERNS HOUSE EVENING Fern stands in front of her old house for a moment, the small red mailbox is covered in rust. She walks through the empty house, stepping over broken floor tiles and tumbleweeds, onto the backyard where she shared happy memories with the man she loved. The rosebushes she planted are still there, withered. Fern is unable to move, not forward nor back. She allows herself, for a moment longer, to be lost in time. Then she walks on, leaving the yard behind, passing the fence door, towards the endless desert lies beyond, stretching all the way to the horizon. FADE TO BLACK. . """
The Shawshank Redemption,tt0111161,1995,Oscar,"""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Written by Frank Darabont Based upon the story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King INT CABIN NIGHT () A dark, empty room. The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at flesh, mouths locked together. He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with the sensations running through her. He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling smoothly outside... EXT CABIN NIGHT () ...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the lovers' cries spilling into the night... ...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls... ...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... ...a car is revealed. A Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. INT PLYMOUTH NIGHT () ANDY DUFRESNE, mid's, wire rim glasses, threepiece suit. Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path. He can hear them fucking from here. He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: You stepped out of a dream... You are too wonderful... To be what you seem... He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully revealing a . revolver. Oily, black, evil. He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car. EXT PLYMOUTH NIGHT () His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. WOMAN (O.S.) Oh god...oh god...oh god... Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of postcoitus. We hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. WOMAN (O.S.) (CONTD) Oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best I ever had... Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really. FADE TO BLACK: ST TITLE UP . INT COURTROOM DAY () THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, palefaced and stupefied. D.A. (O.S.) Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered. ANDY DUFRESNE is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: ANDY It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno. D.A. What was your response? ANDY I told her I would not grant one. D.A. (refers to his notes) I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno. Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors. ANDY If they say so. I really don't remember. I was upset. FADE TO BLACK: ND TITLE UP D.A. What happened after you and your wife argued? ANDY She packed a bag and went to stay with Mr. Quentin. D.A. Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the Falmouth Hills Country Club. (MORE) . The man you had recently discovered was her lover. (Andy nods) Did you follow her? ANDY I went to a few bars first. Later, I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's home and confront them. They weren't there...so I parked my car in the turnout...and waited. D.A. With what intention? ANDY I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. I think mostly I wanted to scare them. D.A. You had a gun with you? ANDY Yes. I did. FADE TO BLACK: RD TITLE UP D.A. When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them? ANDY No. I was sobering up. I realized she wasn't worth it. I decided to let her have her quickie divorce. D.A. Quickie divorce indeed. A . caliber divorce, wrapped in a handtowel to muffle the shots, isn't that what you mean? And then you shot her lover! ANDY I did not. I got back in the car and drove home to sleep it off. Along the way, I stopped and threw my gun into the Royal River. I feel I've been very clear on this point. D.A. (CONT'D) . D.A. Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, though, is the part where the cleaning woman shows up the next morning and finds your wife and her lover in bed, riddled with . caliber bullets. Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me? ANDY (softly) Yes. It does. D.A. I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't think the jury heard that. ANDY Yes. It does. D.A. Does what? ANDY Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. D.A. On that, sir, we are in accord... FADE TO BLACK! TH TITLE UP D.A. (CONTD) You claim you threw your gun into the Royal River before the murders took place. That's rather convenient. ANDY It's the truth. D.A. You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? He and his men dragged that river for three days and nary a gun was found. So no comparison can be made between your gun and the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims. That's also rather convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? . ANDY (faint, bitter smile) Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient the gun was never found. FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP INT COURTROOM DAY () The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation: D.A. Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence? He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. D.A. (CONTD) I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September this year of our Lord, , by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think about that, think about this... He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. D.A. (CONTD) A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this was not a hotblooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and coldblooded nature. Consider! (MORE) . Four bullets per victim! Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra bullet per lover...right in the head. (a few JURORS shiver) I'm done talking. You people are all decent, Godfearing Christian folk. You know what to do. FADE TO BLACK: TH TITLE UP INT JURY ROOM DAY () CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the next. These decent, Godfearing Christians are chowing down on a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn. VOICE (O.S.) Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes. FADE TO BLACK: TH TITLE UP INT COURTROOM DAY () Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall. JUDGE You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. By the power vested in me by the State of Maine, I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims. So be it. He raps his gavel as we CRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. AN IRONBARRED DOOR slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in: D.A. (CONTD) . INT SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM DAY () RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair. MAN # Sit. Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable. MAN # We see by your file you've served twenty years of a life sentence. MAN # You feel you've been rehabilitated? RED Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it. The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. CLOSEUP PAROLE FORM A big rubber stamp slams down: """"REJECTED"""" in red ink. EXT EXERCISE YARD SHAWSHANK PRISON DUSK () High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. Exercise period. RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches lowkey through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business. He's an important man here. RED (V.O.) There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason. He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleightofhand. . RED (V.O.) Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & Roebuck. TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. RED (V.O.) So when Andy Dufresne came to me in and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. And it wasn't. CON Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. INT PRISON BUS DUSK () Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. RED (V.O.) Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin'. The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls. RED (V.O.) On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then. TOWER GUARD All clear! GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. The new fish disembark, chained together singlefile, blinking sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in front of him, almost drags him down. BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS and SHOUTS from the spectators. . HADLEY On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again. ON THE BLEACHERS RED There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet. HEYWOOD Never seen such a sorrylookin' heap of maggot shit in my life. JIGGER Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all... FLOYD Takin' bets today, Red? RED (pulls notepad and pencil) Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. FLOYD Smokes. Put me down for two. RED High roller. Who's your horse? FLOYD That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first. HEYWOOD Bullshit. I'll take that action. ERNIE Me too. Other hands go up. Red jots the names. HEYWOOD You're out some smokes, son. Take my word. FLOYD You're so smart, you call it. . HEYWOOD I say that chubby fatass...let's see...fifth from the front. Put me down for a quarter deck. RED That's five cigarettes on FatAss. Any takers? More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The oldtimers are shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look terrified. Especially Andy. RED (V.O.) I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He might'a been important on the outside, but in here he was just a little turd in prison grays. Looked like a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man. SKEET What say, Red? RED Little fella on the end. Definitely. I stake half a pack. Any takers? SNOOZE Rich bet. RED C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me wrong? (hands go up) Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, gentlemen, this window's closed. Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers: VOICE (AMPLIFIED) Return to your cellblocks for evening count. . INT ADMITTING AREA DUSK () The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor. HADLEY Eyes front. WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes. NORTON This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. You are sinners and scum, that's why they sent you to me. Rule number one: no blaspheming. I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison. The other rules you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions? CON When do we eat? Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams right in his face: HADLEY YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT DICK MOTHERFUCKER! Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly: NORTON Any other questions? (there are none) I believe in two things. Discipline and the Bible. Here, you'll receive both. (holds up a Bible) Put your faith in the Lord. Your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank. . HADLEY Off with them clothes! And I didn't say take all day doing it, did I? The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked. HADLEY (CONTD) First man into the shower! Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out. HADLEY (CONTD) Delouse that piece of shit! Next man in! The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes, he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short stack of items through the slot prison clothes and a Bible. All the men are processed quickly a blast of water, powder, clothes and a Bible... INT INFIRMARY NIGHT () A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam. A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat. DOCTOR Bend over. The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets the same treatment. INT PRISON CHAPEL NIGHT () CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open. CHAPLAIN (O.S.) ...maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul... INT CELLBLOCK FIVE NIGHT () Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying their clothes and Bibles. . The CONS in their cells greet them with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. RED (V.O.) The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you're born, fresh from a Bible reading, skin burning and halfblind from that delousing shit they throw on you... Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, cigarette dangling from his fingers. RED (V.O.) ...and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye...a long cold season in hell stretching out ahead...nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it. Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few others being brought up to the nd tier. RED (V.O.) Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be? Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. RED (V.O.) It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne... INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it in. He slowly begins to dress himself... EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON NIGHT () A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night. . INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE NIGHT () LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame. GUARD That's lights out! Good night, ladies. The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the tiers toward Red's cell. RED (V.O.) I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now. Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering. VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting: VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.) Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're gonna like it here, new fish. A whooole lot...Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies...You takin' this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz later. (somebody LAUGHS) Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... RED (V.O.) The boys always go fishin' with firsttimers...and they don't quit till they reel someone in. The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark... INT VARIOUS CELLS NIGHT () thru thru ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dryheaving into the toilet... . INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head, peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep. HEYWOOD (O.S.) FatAss...oh, FaaaatAss. Talk to me, boy. I know you're in there. I can hear you breathin'. Now don't you listen to these nitwits, hear? INT FATASS' CELL NIGHT () FatAss is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. HEYWOOD (O.S.) This ain't such a bad place. I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home. I know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make your acquaintance...especially that big white mushy butt of yours... And that's it. FatAss lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair: FATASS OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I WANNA GO HOME! INT HEYWOOD'S CELL NIGHT () HEYWOOD AND IT'S FATASS BY A NOSE.' INT CELLBLOCK NIGHT () The place goes nuts. FatAss throws himself screaming against the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING: VOICES Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish... FATASS I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' VOICE (O.S.) I had your mother! She wasn't that great! The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself. HADLEY What the Christ is this happy shit? . VOICE (O.S.) He took the Lord's name in vain! I'm tellin' the warden! HADLEY (to the unseen wit) You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass! Hadley arrives at FatAss' cell, bellowing through the bars: HADLEY (CONTD) What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkeyspunk? FATASS PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! HADLEY I ain't gonna count to three! Not even to one! Now shut the fuck up 'fore I sing you a lullabye! FatAss keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freakout. Hadley draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls FatAss out and starts beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. FatAss falls, tries to crawl. The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull THWACKTHWACKTHWACK of the baton. Fatass passes out. Hadley gets in a few more licks and finally stops. HADLEY (CONTD) Get this tub of shit down to the infirmary. (peers around) If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here the rest of the night, by God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all visit the infirmary. Every last motherfucker here. The guards wrestle FatAss onto a stretcher and carry him off. FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence. INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes riveted to the small puddle of blood where FatAss went down. . RED (V.O.) His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound... INT CELLBLOCK FIVE MORNING () LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown KATHUMP! The cons step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler their headcounts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. Red peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, collar buttoned, hair combed. INT MESS HALL MORNING () Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their stares, he picks up his spoon and pauses, seeing something in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age , he's a senior citizen, a longstanding resident. BROOKS You gonna eat that? ANDY Hadn't planned on it. BROOKS You mind? Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. BROOKS (CONTD) Mmm. Nice and ripe. Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket. Andy breathes a sigh of relief. . BROOKS (CONTD) Jake says thanks. Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop. I'm lookin' after him till he's old enough to fly. Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches. JIGGER Oh, Christ, here he comes. HEYWOOD Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. You know why it's fine? Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out cigarettes and handing them down. HEYWOOD (CONTD) That's right, send 'em all down. I wanna see 'em lined up in a row, pretty as a chorus line. An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture. FLOYD Smell my ass... HEYWOOD Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your horse comin' in last and all. Hell, I sure do love that horse of mine. I believe I owe that boy a big sloppy kiss when I see him. RED Give him some'a your cigarettes instead, cheap bastard. HEYWOOD Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty this week? How's that winnin' horse of mine, anyway? TYRELL Dead. (the men fall silent) Hadley busted his head pretty good. Doc already went home for the night. Poor bastard lay there till this morning. By then... . He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly: ANDY What was his name? HEYWOOD What? What'd you say? ANDY I was wondering if anyone knew his name. HEYWOOD What the fuck you care, new fish? (resumes eating) Doesn't matter what his fuckin' name was. He's dead. INT PRISON LAUNDRY DAY () A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done. INT SHOWERS DAY () Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters. BOGS You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet? Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey. BOGS (CONTD) Hard to get. I like that. Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. . EXT EXERCISE YARD DAY () Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. ANDY (offers his hand) Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues. RED The wifekillin' banker. ANDY How do you know that? RED I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it? ANDY I didn't, since you ask. RED Hell, you'll fit right in, then. (off Andy's look) Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy? HEYWOOD Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! Red gives Andy a look. See? ANDY What else have you heard? RED People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true? ANDY What do you think? RED Ain't made up my mind yet. Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the ball hard right at Andy's head. . Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. ANDY I understand you're a man who knows how to get things. RED I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish. ANDY I wonder if you could get me a rock hammer? RED What is it and why? ANDY You make your customers' motives a part of your business? RED If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a nonlethal sort of object. ANDY Fair enough. A rockhammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks. RED Rocks. Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red. RED (CONTD) Quartz? ANDY Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. (MORE) . There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill. RED So? ANDY I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale. RED Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull? ANDY I have no enemies here. RED No? Just wait. Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. RED (CONTD) Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs. ANDY Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual? RED Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. (off Andy's look) Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you. ANDY Thanks for the advice. RED That comes free. But you understand my concern. ANDY If there's trouble, I doubt a rock hammer will do me any good. ANDY (CONT'D) . RED Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? (Andy laughs politely) I miss the joke. What's so funny? ANDY You'll know when you see the rock hammer. RED What's this item usually go for? ANDY Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop. RED My standard markup's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even. ANDY Ten it is. RED I'll see what I can do. (rises, slapping dust) But it's a waste of money. ANDY Oh? RED Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum. ANDY I understand. Thank you, Mr...? RED Red. The name's Red. ANDY Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you. . They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. RED (V.O.) I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. (resumes playing catch) Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start. INT MESS HALL DAY () Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in step, slips him a tightlyfolded square of paper. INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill. RED (V.O.) He was a man who adapted fast. EXT LOADING DOCK DAY () Under watchful supervision, CONS are offloading bags of dirty laundry from an """"Eliot Nursing Home"""" truck. RED (V.O.) Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars... A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart... INT PRISON LAUNDRY DAY () Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line. RED (V.O.) When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there. . Leonard slips a small paperwrapped package out of the laundry bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... INT PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE DAY () Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out. RED (V.O.) That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination. Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets. He hands it across to Red TIGHT ANGLE and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's. INT RED'S CELL DAY () Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the rockhammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly. RED (V.O.) Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE ND TIER NIGHT () Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the rockhammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. RED Dufresne. Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: BROOKS Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes. . Brooks turns his cart around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a single word: """"Thanks."""" INT PRISON LAUNDRY DAY () We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. Andy is doing his job, getting good at it. BOB DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the laundry room and into INT BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA DAY () a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way. Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful. ANDY You get this in your eyes, it blinds you. BOGS Honey, hush. Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against an old fourpocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit. . Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: BOGS (CONTD) That's it, fight. Better that way. Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... ...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past concrete walls and steel pipes... RED (V.O.) I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairytale world. WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for a final view of the line. The giant steel """"mangler"""" is slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. RED (V.O.) He never said who did it...but we all knew. PRISON MONTAGE: ( THROUGH ) ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND shaping his rocks after lightsout... RED (V.O.) Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine. ANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. RED (V.O.) Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. ANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS RED (V.O.) The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight them off... sometimes not. . ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. RED (V.O.) He always fought, that's what I remember. He fought because he knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time. The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They beat the hell out of him. RED (V.O.) Half the time it landed him in the infirmary... INT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT (""""THE HOLE"""") NIGHT () A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door. RED (V.O.) ...the other half, it landed him in solitary. Warden Norton's """"grain & drain"""" vacation. Bread, water, and all the privacy you could want. INT PRISON LAUNDRY DAY () Andy is working the line. RED (V.O.) And that's how it went for Andy. That was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him. And I also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him. But then, in the spring of , the powersthatbe decided that... EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: NORTON ...the roof of the licenseplate factory needs resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work. (MORE) . We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here... Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye. RED (V.O.) It was outdoor detail, and May is one damn fine month to be workin' outdoors. EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket. RED (V.O.) More than a hundred men volunteered for the job. Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters discreetly in his ear. EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red exchanges grins with Andy and the others. RED (V.O.) Wouldn't you know it? Me and some fellas I know were among the names called. INT PRISON CORRIDOR NIGHT () Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes. RED (V.O.) Only cost us a pack of smokes per man. I made my usual twenty percent, of course. EXT LICENSE PLATE FACTORY DAY () A tarcooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to THE ROOF where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: NORTON (CONT'D) . HADLEY ...so this shithead lawyer calls long distance from Texas, and he says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He says, sorry to inform you, but your brother just died. YOUNGBLOOD Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. HADLEY I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off years ago, family ain't heard of him since. Figured him for dead anyway. So this lawyer prick says, your brother died a rich man. Oil wells and shit, close to a million bucks. Jesus, it's frigging incredible how lucky some assholes can get. TROUT A million bucks? JeezLouise! You get any of that? HADLEY Thirty five thousand. That's what he left me. TROUT Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! Like winnin' a lottery... (off Hadley's shitty look) ...ain't it? HADLEY Dumbshit. What do you figger the government's gonna do to me? Take a big wet bite out of my ass, is what. TROUT Oh. Hadn't thought of that. HADLEY Maybe leave me enough to buy a new car with. Then what happens? You pay tax on the car. Repairs and maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' you to take 'em for a ride... . MERT And drive it, if they're old enough. HADLEY That's right, wanting to drive it, wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! Then at the end of the year, if you figured the tax wrong, they make you pay out of your own pocket. Uncle Sam puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple. Always get the short end. That's a fact. (spits over the side) Some brother. Shit. The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. HEYWOOD Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' luck. Imagine inheriting thirty five thousand dollars. RED Crying shame. Some folks got it awful bad. Red glances over and is shocked to see Andy standing up, listening to the guards talk. RED (CONTD) Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on your pail! Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley. RED (CONTD) Andy! Come back! Shit! SNOOZE What's he doing? FLOYD Gettin' himself killed. RED God damn it... HEYWOOD Just keep spreadin' tar... . The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes to his holster. The tower guards CLICKCLACK their rifle bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there. ANDY Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? HADLEY That's funny. You're gonna look funnier suckin' my dick with no fuckin' teeth. ANDY What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back? Try to hamstring you? HADLEY That's it! Step aside, Mert. This fucker's havin' hisself an accident. Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar. HEYWOOD Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof... SNOOZE Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... ANDY Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money. Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt. HADLEY You better start making sense. ANDY If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a onetime only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars. . HADLEY Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? ANDY Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion. HADLEY You're the smart banker what shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So's I can wind up in here with you? ANDY It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself. HADLEY Fuckin'A. I don't need no smart wifekillin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat. ANDY Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the taxfree gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example... HADLEY Ambulancechaaing, highwayrobbing cocksuckers! ANDY ...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge. (off Hadley's look) I'd only ask three beers apiece for my coworkers, if that seems fair. TROUT (guffawing) Coworkers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it? Coworkers... . Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on: ANDY I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion. The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They look like they've been poleaxed. Hadley shoots them a look. HADLEY What are you jimmies starin' at? Back to work, goddamn it! EXT LICENSE PLATE FACTORY DAY () As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by rope only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice. RED (V.O.) And that's how it came to pass, that on the secondtolast day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '... EXT ROOF SHORTLY LATER () The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. RED (V.O.) ...wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison. HADLEY Drink up, boys. While it's cold. RED (V.O.) The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous. Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his tongue and the warm sun on face. RED (V.O.) We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men. We could'a been tarring the . roof of one of our own houses. We were the Lords of all Creation. He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others. RED (V.O.) As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer. HEYWOOD (approaches with a beer) Here's a cold one, Andy. ANDY No thanks. I gave up drinking. Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. RED (V.O.) You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again...if only for a short while. EXT PRISON YARD THE BLEACHERS DAY () Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move. RED King me. ANDY Chess. Now there's a game of kings. Civilized...strategic... RED ...and totally fuckin' inexplicable. Hate that game. ANDY Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting a board together. RED You come to the right place. I'm the man who can get things. . ANDY We might do business on a board. But the pieces, I'd like to carve those myself. One side done in quartz... the opposing side in limestone. RED That'd take you years. ANDY Years I've got. What I don't have are the rocks. Pickings here in the exercise yard are pretty slim. RED How's that rockhammer workin' out anyway? Scratch your name on your wall yet? ANDY (smiles) Not yet. I suppose I should. RED Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be friends, ain't we? ANDY I suppose we are. RED I ask a question? Why'd you do it? ANDY I'm innocent, remember? Just like everybody else here. Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing. ANDY (CONTD) What are you in for, Red? RED Murder. Same as you. ANDY Innocent? RED The only guilty man in Shawshank. . INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment of quartz by the light of the moon. He pauses, glancing at all the names scratched in the wall. He rises, makes sure the coast is clear, and starts scratching his name into the cement with his rockhammer, adding to the record. RAY MILLAND fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black & white, suffering a bad case of DT's... INT PRISON AUDITORIUM NIGHT () ...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, watching the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him. RED Here's the good part. Bugs come out of the walls to get his ass. ANDY I know. I've seen it three times this month already. Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with him, highpitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. ANDY (CONTD) Can we talk business? RED Sure. What do you want? ANDY Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? RED No problem. Take a few weeks. ANDY Weeks? RED Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman. Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, turns back to the movie. . INT AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR NIGHT () Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and Pete. Andy turns back and runs right into Bogs. Instant bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a door open and drag him into THE PROJECTION BOOTH where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals. BOGS Take a walk. PROJECTIONIST I have to change reels. BOGS I said fuck off. Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. ANDY I know. I've seen it three times this month already. Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS witt him, highpitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. ANDY (CONTD) Can we talk business? RED Sure. What do you want? ANDY Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? RED No problem. Take a few weeks. ANDY Weeks? RED Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman. . Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, turns back to the movie. INT AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR NIGHT () Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and Pete. Andy turns back and runs right into Bogs. Instant bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a door open and drag him into THE PROJECTION BOOTH where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals. BOGS Take a walk. PROJECTIONIST I have to change reels. BOGS I said fuck off. Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. BOGS (CONTD) Ain't you gonna scream? Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. ANDY They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with. Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind bench and curls his fingers around a full . foot reel of mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others. ROOSTER Me first. ANDY Okay. Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. . ROOSTER Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious eightinch spike, gives him a good long look at it. BOGS Now I'm gonna open my fly, and you're gonna swallow what I give you to swallow. And when you d mine, you gonna swallow Rooster's. You done broke his nose, so he ought to have somethin' to show for it. ANDY Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose. BOGS You don't understand. You do that, I'll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear. ANDY Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. (faint smile) In fact, I understand the bite reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar. The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. BOGS You little fuck. Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. RED (V.O.) Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth, and neither did his friends. What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life... . INT INFIRMARY DAY () Andy lies wrapped in bandages. RED (V.O.) Andy spent a month in traction. INT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT DAY () RED (V.O.) Bogs spent a week in the hole. Bogs sits on bare concrete. The steel door slides open. GUARD Time's up, Bogs. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE RD TIER DUSK () Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE echoes dimly over the P.A. system: VOICE (O.S.) Return to your cellblocks for evening count. Bogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind Bogs. hemming him. Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say """"what the fuck,"""" Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out. GROUND FLOOR Ernie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop cart loaded with supplies. ND TIER Red is darning a sock in his open cell. He pauses, frowning, hearing strange THUMPING sounds. What the hell is that? RD TIER It's Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good measure. He feebly tries to ward them off. ND TIER . Puzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound. It dawns on him that it's coming from above. He moves to the railing and leans out, craning around to look up RED'S POV just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing directly toward us, eyes bugging out, SCREAMING as he falls. RED (SLOW MOTION) jumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that too), SCREAMING aaaaalll the way down GROUND FLOOR and impacting on Ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous eruption of solvents and cleansers. The cart is squashed flat, shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogsrelated wreckage at his feet. ND TIER Red is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the rd tier railing. Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head. MERT Damn, Byron. Look'a that. HADLEY Poor fella must'a tripped. A tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and splashes across Red's upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then looks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene. RED (V.O.) Two things never happened again after that. The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again... EXT PRISON YARD/LOADING DOCK DAY () Bogs, wheelchairbound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded onto an ambulance for transport. Behind the fence stand Red and his friends, watching. . RED (V.O.) ...and Bogs never walked again. They transferred him to a minimum security hospital upstate. To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days drinking his food through a straw. RED I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary. HEYWOOD Sounds good to us. Figure we owe him for the beer. RED Man likes to play chess. Let's get him some rocks. EXT FIELD DAY () A HUNDRED CONS at work. Hoes rise and fall in long waves. GUARDS patrol on horseback. Heywood turns up a rocky chunk, quickly shoves it down his pants. He maneuvers to Red and the others, pulls out the chunk and shows it to them. FLOYD That ain't quartz. Nor limestone. HEYWOOD What are you, fuckin' geologist? SNOOZE He's right, it ain't. HEYWOOD What the hell is it then? RED Horse apple. HEYWOOD Bullshit. RED No, horse shit. Petrified. Cackling, the men go back to work. Heywood stares at the rock. He crumbles it in his hands. . RED (V.O.) Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style... INT PRISON LAUNDRY BACK ROOM DAY () A huge detergent box is filled with rocks, hidden in the shadows behind a boiler furnace. RED (V.O.) ...and by the week Andy was due back, we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till Rapture. ANGLE SHIFTS to Red as he plops a bag of """"laundry"""" on the floor. Leonard and Bob toss a few more down. Red starts pulling out contraband, giving them their commissions. RED (V.O.) Also got a big shipment in that week. Cigarettes, chewing gum, shoelaces, playing cards with naked ladies on 'em, you name it... (pulls a cardboard tube) ...and, of course, the most important item. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE NIGHT () Andy, limping a bit, returns from the infirmary. Red watches from his cell as Andy is brought up and locked away. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk. GUARD (O.S.) Lights out! The lights go off. Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large rolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the famous Rita Hayworth pinup one hand behind her head, eyes half closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of paper. It reads: """"No charge. Welcome back."""" Alone in the dark, Andy smiles. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE MORNING () The BUZZER SOUNDS, the cells SLAM OPEN. Cons step from their cells. Andy catches Red's eye, nods his thanks. As the men shuffle down to breakfast, Red glances into Andy's cell . RED'S POV DOLLYING PAST and sees Rita in her new place of honor on Andy's wall. Sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE NIGHT () Ernie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell: ERNIE Heads up. They're tossin' cells. Word travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. GUARD What kind'a contraband you hiding in there, boy? Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff. A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible. NORTON Solitary. A week. Make sure he takes his Bible. CON Too goddamn dark to read down there. NORTON Add another week for blasphemy. The man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up. NORTON (CONTD) Let's try the second tier. ND TIER Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random. He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises. . ANDY Good evening. Norton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy, looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the Bible out of Andy's hand. NORTON I'm pleased to see you reading this. Any favorite passages? ANDY Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh. NORTON (smiles) Luke. Chapter , verse . I've always liked that one. (strolls the cell) But I prefer: """"I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."""" ANDY John. Chapter , verse . NORTON I hear you're good with numbers. How nice. A man should have a skill. HADLEY You wanna explain this? Andy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. ANDY It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine. Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to Norton. HADLEY Looks pretty clean. Some contraband here, nothing to get in a twist over. . Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita. NORTON I can't say I approve of this... (turns to Andy) ...but I suppose exceptions can always be made. Norton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and locked. Norton pauses, turns back. NORTON (CONTD) I almost forgot. He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy. NORTON (CONTD) I'd hate to deprive you of this. Salvation lies within. Norton and his men walk away. RED (V.O.) Tossin' cells was just an excuse. Truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up. INT PRISON LAUNDRY DAY () Andy is working the line. Hadley enters and confers briefly with Bob. Bob nods, crosses to Andy, taps him. Andy turns, removes an earplug. Bob shouts over the machine noise: BOB DUFRESNE! YOU'RE OFF THE LINE! INT WARDEN NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () Andy is led in. Norton is at his desk doing paperwork. Andy's eyes go to a framed needlepoint sampler on the wall behind him that reads: """"HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON."""" NORTON My wife made that in church group. ANDY It's very pretty, sir. NORTON You like working in the laundry? ANDY No, sir. Not especially. . NORTON Perhaps we can find something more befitting a man of your education. INT MAIN BUILDING STORAGE ROOMS DAY () A series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing cabinets, desks, paint supplies, etc. Andy enters. He hears a FLUTTER OF WINGS. An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and struts back and forth, checking him out. Andy smiles. ANDY Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room. BROOKS Andy! Thought I heard you out here! ANDY I've been reassigned to you. BROOKS I know, they told me. Ain't that a kick in the ass? Come on in, I'll give you the dime tour. INT SHAWSHANK PRISON LIBRARY DAY () Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all. Rough plank shelves are lined with books. Brooks' private domain. BROOKS Here she is, the Shawshank Prison Library. Along this side, we got the National Geographics. That side, the Reader's Digest Condensed books. Bottom shelf there, some Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley Gardners. Every night I pile the cart and make my rounds. I write down the names on this clipboard here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, Japanesey. Any questions? Andy pauses. Something about this doesn't make any sense. ANDY Brooks? How long have you been librarian? BROOKS Since . Yuh, over years. . ANDY In all that time, have you ever had an assistant? BROOKS Never needed one. Not much to it, is there? ANDY So why now? Why me? BROOKS I dunno. Be nice to have some comp'ny down here for a change. HADLEY (O.S.) Dufresne! ANDY STEPS BACK INTO THE OUTER ROOMS AND FINDS HADLEY WITH another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS. HADLEY (CONTD) That's him. That's the one. Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally: DEKINS I'm Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 'bout maybe settin' up some kinda trust fund for my kids' educations. Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles. ANDY I see. Well. Why don't we have a seat and talk it over? BROOKS Pull down one'a them desks there. Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy. ANDY What did you have in mind? A weekly draw on your pay? DEKINS Yuh. I figured just stick it in the bank, but Captain Hadley said check with you first. . ANDY He was right. You don't want your money in a bank. DEKINS I don't? ANDY What's that gonna earn you? Two and a half, three percent a year? We can do a lot better than that. (wets his pen) So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do you want to send your kids? Harvard? Yale? INT MESS HALL DAY () FLOYD He didn't say that! BROOKS God is my witness. And Dekins, he just blinks for a second, then laughs his ass off. Afterward, he actually shook Andy's hand. HEYWOOD My ass! BROOKS Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about shit myself. All Andy needed was a suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on his desk, he would'a been Mister Dufresne, if you please. RED Makin' yourself some friends, Andy. ANDY I wouldn't say """"friends."""" I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have. RED Got you out of the laundry, didn't it? ANDY Maybe it can do more than that. (off their looks) (MORE) . How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there. HEYWOOD How you 'spect to do that, """"Mr. Dufresneifyouplease?"""" ANDY Ask the warden for funds. LAUGHTER all around. Andy blinks at them. BROOKS Son, I've had six wardens through here during my tenure, and I have learned one great immutable truth of the universe: ain't one of 'em been born whose asshole don't pucker up tight as a snare drum when you ask for funds. INT MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY DAY () DOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall: NORTON Not a dime. My budget's stretched thin as it is. ANDY I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them. NORTON Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hardearned when it come to prisons. More walls. More bars. More guards. ANDY Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter a week. They can't ignore me forever. NORTON They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy. I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that? ANDY (CONT'D) . INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter. RED (V.O.) So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said. INT GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE DAY () Andy pops his head in. The GUARD shakes his head. RED (V.O.) And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers. But still he kept on. INT PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE DAY () Andy is doing taxes. Mert Entwhistle is seated across from him. Other offduty guards are waiting their turn. RED (V.O.) The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank. INT PRISON LIBRARY ONE YEAR LATER () Tax time again. Even more guards are waiting. RED (V.O.) Year after that, he did them all... including the warden's. EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND DAY () A BATTER in a """"Noresby Marauders"""" baseball uniform WHACKS the ball high into left field and races for first. RED (V.O.) Year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season... INT PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE DAY () The Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door. RED (V.O.) The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W 's. . ANDY Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it? THE BATTER Damn right, and the holster too. ANDY See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off. RED (V.O.) Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R Block. In fact, he got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores. ANDY Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those s? RED (V.O.) Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me. INT GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE DAY () Andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack. RED (V.O.) And still he kept sending those letters... INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a fourinch length of quartz. It's a beautifullycrafted chess piece in the shape of a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face. EXT EXERCISE YARD DAY () Floyd runs into the yard, scared and winded. He finds Andy and Red on the bleachers. FLOYD Red? Andy? It's Brooks. . INT PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE DAY () Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a chokehold and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified. JIGGER C'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just calm the fuck down, okay? BROOKS Goddamn miserable pukeeatin' sons of whores! He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air. RED What the hell's going on? SNOOZE You tell me, man. One second he was fine, then out came the knife. I better get the guards. RED No. We'll handle this. Ain't that right, Brooks? Just settle down and we'll talk about it, okay? BROOKS Nothing left to talk about! It's all talked out! Nothing left now but to cut his fuckin' throat! RED Why? What's Heywood done to you? BROOKS That's what they want! It's the price I gotta pay! Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly: ANDY Brooks, you're not going to hurt Heywood, we all know that. Even Heywood knows it, right Heywood? HEYWOOD (nods, terrified) Sure. I know that. Sure. . ANDY Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man. RED (cuing nods all around) Yeah, that's right. That's what everybody says. ANDY You're not fooling anybody, so just put the damn knife down and stop scaring the shit out of people. BROOKS But it's the only way they'll let me stay. Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red. Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs. ANDY Take it easy. You'll be all right. HEYWOOD Him? What about me? Crazy old fool! Goddamn near slit my throat! RED You've had worse from shaving. What'd you do to set him off? HEYWOOD Nothin'! Just came in to say fare theewell. (off their looks) Ain't you heard? His parole came through! Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to understand. Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly: RED Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be long till you're squiring pretty young girls on your arm and telling 'em lies. . EXT PRISON YARD BLEACHERS DUSK () ANDY I just don't understand what happened in there, that's all. HEYWOOD Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse, is what. RED Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing wrong with Brooksie. He's just institutionalized, that's all. HEYWOOD Institutionalized, my ass. RED Man's been here fifty years. This place is all he knows. In here, he's an important man, an educated man. A librarian. Out there, he's nothing but a usedup old con with arthritis in both hands. Couldn't even get a library card if he applied. You see what I'm saying? FLOYD Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass. RED Believe what you want. These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's """"institutionalized."""" JIGGER Shit. I could never get that way. ERNIE (softly) Say that when you been inside as long as Brooks has. RED Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and that's just what they take. Part that counts, anyway. . EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON DAWN () The sun rises over gray stone. INT ANDY'S CELL DAWN () ANGLE ON RITA POSTER. Sexy as ever. The rising sun sends fingers of rosy light creeping across her face. INT LIBRARY DAWN () Brooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, cradling Jake in his hands. BROOKS I can't take care of you no more. You go on now. You're free. He tosses Jake through the bars. The crow flaps away. EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON MAIN GATE DAY () TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks back. Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing him off. The massive gate closes, wiping them from view. INT BUS DAY () Brooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by terror of speed and motion. BROOKS (V.O.) Dear Fellas. I can't believe how fast things move on the outside. EXT STREET PORTLAND, MAINE DAY () Brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his parents. People and traffic a blur. BROOKS (V.O.) I saw an automobile once when I was young. Now they're everywhere. EXT BREWSTER HOTEL DAY () Brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk. He glances up as a propdriven airliner streaks in low overhead. . BROOKS (V.O.) The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. He arrives at the Brewster. It ain't much to look at. INT BREWSTER HOTEL DAY () A WOMAN leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor. He has trouble climbing so many stairs. WOMAN No music in your room after eight p.m. No guests after nine. No cooking except on the hotplate... BROOKS (V.O.) People even talk faster. And louder. INT BROOKS' ROOM DAY () Brooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, like a man waiting for a bus. BROOKS (V.O.) The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway... INT FOODWAY MARKET DAY () Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. WOMAN Make sure he doublebags. Last time your man didn't doublebag and the bottom near came out. MANAGER You doublebag like the lady says, understand? BROOKS Yes sir, doublebag, surely will. BROOKS (V.O.) It's hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. (MORE) . I don't think the store manager likes me very much. EXT PARK DAY () Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons. BROOKS (V.O.) Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends. INT BROOKS' ROOM NIGHT () Dark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid. Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place. BROOKS (V.O.) I have trouble sleeping at night. The bed is too big. I have bad dreams, like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. INT FOODWAY DAY () BROOKS (V.O.) Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. INT BROOKS' ROOM DAY () Brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag. Undershirts, socks, etc. BROOKS (V.O.) But I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. INT BROOKS' ROOM SHORTLY LATER () Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door. BROOKS (V.O.) (CONT'D) . BROOKS (V.O.) I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay. He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing the beam, he carves a message into the wood: """"Brooks Hatlen was here."""" He smiles with a sort of inner peace. BROOKS (V.O.) I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me. TIGHT ON CHAIR His weight shifts on the wobbly chair and it goes out from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly in midair. His hat falls to the floor. ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently, facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below. EXT EXERCISE YARD SHAWSHANK DAY () Andy reads the letter to Red and the others: ANDY P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat. No hard feelings. A long silence. Andy folds the letter, puts it away. Softly: RED He should'a died in here, goddamn it. INT PRISON LIBRARY DAY () Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the shelf and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the wood. He glances up. The ants disappear over the top. He pulls a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over. ANDY Red! Red steps in with an armload of files. Andy gingerly reaches in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow. . RED (softly) Is that Jake? INT WOOD SHOP DAY () Red is making something at his bench, sanding and planing. RED (V.O.) It never would have occurred to us, if not for Andy. It was his idea. We all agreed it was the right thing to do... EXT FIELDS DAY () Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye. We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley's chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS. GUARD Water break! Five minutes! The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy. Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The guards haven't noticed. Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval. ANDY That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. HEYWOOD Shovel man in. Watch the dirt. Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole. BY THE TRUCK Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope. YOUNGBLOOD What the fuck. . HADLEY (follows his gaze) HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE! (works his rifle bolt) YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT SOMEBODY! Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of them heading toward the slope. The guards look around. HADLEY (CONTD) What am I, talkin' to myself? ON THE SLOPE Andy pulls a towelwrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. RED Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a crow. Neither was much to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what you can do for 'em. Amen. Muttered """"amens"""" all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the small grave and tamp it down. INT SHAWSHANK CORRIDORS DAY () RAPID DOLLY with Hadley. He's striding, pissedoff, a man on e mission. He straightarms a door and emerges onto EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON WALL DAY () the wall overlooking the exercise yard. He leans on the railing, scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red. HADLEY Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? (Andy looks up) Your ass, warden's office, now! Andy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off. INT GUARD DESK/WARDEN'S OUTER OFFICE DAY () Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty guard, picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy. . ANDY What is all this? HADLEY You tell me, fuckstick! They're addressed to you, every damn one! Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it. WILEY Well, take it. Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads: ANDY Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... """" (stunned, examines check) This is two hundred dollars. Wiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes. ANDY (CONTD) In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office. Andy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight. HADLEY I want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, I shit you not. Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a lovestruck man touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins. WILEY Good for you, Andy. ANDY Only took six years. (beat) From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one. . WILEY (laughs, shakes his head) I believe you're crazy enough. You better get this stuff downstairs like the Captain said. I'm gonna go pinch a loaf. When I get back, this is all gone, right? Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them. He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words """"Portland Public School District"""" stenciled on the side. The box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums. Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. He comes across a certain album Mozart's """"Le Nozze de Figaro."""" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail. INT BATHROOM DAY () Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees. INT GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE DAY () Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty. It is """"Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto,"""" a duet sung by Susanna and the Contessa. INT BATHROOM DAY () Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music. WILEY Andy? You hear that? . INT GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE DAY () Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke. He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A. microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the toggles to """"on."""" A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly... INT/EXT VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS DAY () ...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison. INT BATHROOM DAY () Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles. INT/EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON VARIOUS LOCATIONS DAY () Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing in midstep to listen, gazing up at the speakers. THE STAMPING MACHINES IN THE PLATE SHOP ARE SHUT DOWN... THE LAUNDRY LINE GOES SILENT, GRINDING TO A HALT... THE WOOD SHOP MACHINES ARE TURNED OFF, BUZZING TO A STOP... THE MOTOR POOL...THE KITCHEN...THE LOADING DOCK...THE EXERCISE thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru TO A STUTTERING HALT. NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS. EVERYBODY just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized. INT GUARD STATION DAY () Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly conducting the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men. EXT EXERCISE YARD DAY () CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted. RED (V.O.) I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. (MORE) . I like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it. CAMERA brings us to Red. RED (V.O.) I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away...and for the briefest of moments every last man at Shawshank felt free. INT PRISON CORRIDOR DAY () FAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley. RED (V.O.) It pissed the warden off something terrible. INT GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE DAY () Norton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a sublime smile. We hear Wiley POUNDING on the bathroom door: WILEY (O.S.) LET ME OUUUUT! INT SOLITARY WING DAY () LOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, ruststreaked steel door. God, this is a terrible place to be. RED (V.O.) Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt. INT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT DAY () Andy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet. INT MESS HALL DAY () HEYWOOD Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? Hank Williams? RED (V.O.) (CONT'D) . ANDY They broke the door down before I could take requests. FLOYD Was it worth two weeks in the hole? ANDY Easiest time I ever did. HEYWOOD Shit. No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week seems like a year. ANDY I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all. RED Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? I could'a swore they confiscated that stuff. ANDY (taps his heart, his head) The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red? RED Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't make much sense on the inside. ANDY Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget. RED Forget? ANDY That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope. . RED Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place here. Better get used to the idea. ANDY (softly) Like Brooks did? FADE TO BLACK AN IRONBARRED DOOR slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: INT SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM DAY () Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a parole hearing. He removes his cap and sits. MAN #l It says here you've served thirty years of a life sentence. MAN # You feel you've been rehabilitated? RED Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I'm a changed man. No danger to society, that's the God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated. CLOSEUP PAROLE FORM A big rubber stamp slams down: """"REJECTED."""" EXT PRISON YARD DUSK () Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him. RED Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When you say it like that... ANDY You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went. Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red. . ANDY (CONTD) Anniversary gift. Open it. Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circusred. ANDY (CONTD) Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind. Wanted it to be a surprise. RED It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you. ANDY You gonna play something? Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly: RED Not today. INT CELLBLOCK FIVE/ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The convicts step into their cells. The master switch is thrown and all the doors slam shut KATHUMP! Andy finds a cardboard tube on his bunk. The note reads: """"A new girl for your year anniversary. From your pal. Red."""" INT ANDY'S CELL LATER () Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals the new poster: the famous shot from """"The Seven Year Itch,"""" on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing at her as lightsout commences... INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () ...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days... He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian artifact. He considers trying it out even holds it briefly to his lips, almost embarrassed but puts it back in its box untested. And there the harmonica will stay... FADE TO BLACK WE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... . RED (V.O.) Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing to the State Senate. Two letters a week instead of one. ...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers, faces obscured outlawstyle with kerchiefs against the dust. Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the wall, exploring what used to be a sealedoff storage room. RED (V.O.) In , the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a dollar check. Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of dollars, just to shut him up. INT PRISON LIBRARY DAY () TRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up. Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy. RED (V.O.) Those checks came once a year like clockwork. INT PRISON LIBRARY DAY () Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books. RED (V.O.) You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it. He made deals with book clubs, charity groups...he bought remaindered books by the pound... HEYWOOD Treasure Island. Robert Louis... ANDY (jotting) ...Stevenson. Next? . RED I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving. ANDY Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right behind you. HEYWOOD The Count of Monte Crisco... FLOYD Cristo, you dumbshit. HEYWOOD ...by Alexandree Dumbass. ANDY Dumas. You boys'll like that one. It's about a prison break. Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it first. Red shoots Andy a look. RED Maybe that should go under educational too. INT WOOD SHOP DAY () Red is making a sign, carefully routing letters into a long plank of wood. It turns out to be INT PRISON LIBRARY DAY () the varnished wood sign over the archway: """"Brooks Hatlen Memorial Library."""" TILT DOWN to reveal the library in all its completed glory: shelves lined with books, tables and chairs, even a few potted plants. Heywood is wearing headphones, listening to Hank Williams on the record player. RED (V.O.) By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy had transformed a broom closet smelling of turpentine into the best prison library in New England. EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON DAY () FLASHBULBS POP as Norton addresses MEMBERS OF THE PRESS: . RED (V.O.) That was also the year Warden Norton instituted his famous """"InsideOut"""" program. You may remember reading about it. It made all the papers and got his picture in LIFE magazine. NORTON ...a genuine, progressive advance in corrections and rehabilitation. Our inmates, properly supervised, will be put to work outside these walls performing all manner of public service. Cutting pulpwood, repairing bridges and causeways, digging storm drains... ANGLE TO Red and the boys listening from behind the fence. NORTON (CONTD) These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor while providing a valuable service to the community and at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer! HEYWOOD Sounds like roadgangin', you ask me. RED Nobody asked you. EXT HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE DAY () A ROADGANG is grading a culvert with picks. There's dust and the smell of sweat in the air. GUARDS patrol with sniper rifles, A pushy WOMAN REPORTER in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, trailed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. WOMAN REPORTER You there! You men! We're gonna take your picture now! HEYWOOD Give us a break, lady. WOMAN REPORTER Don't you know who I am? I'm from LIFE magazine! I was told I'd get some cooperation out here! You want me to report you to your warden? Is that what you want? . HEYWOOD (sighs) No, ma'am. WOMAN REPORTER That's more like it! Now I want you all in a row with big bright smiles on your faces! Grab hold of your tools and show 'em to me! She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. Heywood glances around at the other men. HEYWOOD You heard the lady. Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. The others do likewise. The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. Her legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade. HEYWOOD (CONTD) C'mon! We're showin' our tools and grinnin' like fools! Take the damn picture! INT SOLITARY CONFINZMENT NIGHT () Heywood sits alone in the dark. He sighs. RED (V.O.) None of the inmates were invited to express their views... EXT WOODED FIELDS DAY () A ROADGANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud. RED (V.O.) 'Course, Norton failed to mention to the press that """"bare minimum of expense"""" is a fairly loose term. There are a hundred different ways to skim off the top. Men, materials, you name it. And, oh my Lord, how the money rolled in... Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels. NED This keeps up, you're gonna put me out of business! (MORE) . With this pool of slave labor you got, you can underbid any contractor in town. NORTON Ned, we're providing a valuable community service. NED That's fine for the papers, but I got a family to feed. The State don't pay my salary. Sam, we go back a long way. I need this new highway contract. I don't get it, I go under. That's a fact. (hands him a box) Now you just have some'a this fine pie my missus baked specially for you, and you think about that. Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains. IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over to help him. Norton barely takes notice. NORTON Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over this contract. Seems to me I've already got my boys committed elsewhere. You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie. INT NORTON'S OFFICE NIGHT () ANGLE on Maisie's pie. Several pieces gone. RED (V.O.) And behind every shady deal, behind every dollar earned... TILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he totals up figures on an adding machine. RED (V.O.) ...there was Andy, keeping the books. Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near the desk, keeping a watchful eye. NED (CONT'D) . ANDY Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like always. Norton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner. NORTON Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two suits for dryclean and a bag of whatnot. Tell 'em if they over starch my shirts again, they're gonna hear about it from me. (adjusts his tie) How do I look? ANDY Very nice. NORTON Big charity todo up Portland way. Governor's gonna be there. (indicates pie) Want the rest of that? Woman can't bake worth shit. INT PRISON CORRIDOR NIGHT () Andy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie box under his arm. INT LIBRARY DAY () TILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy sort books on the shelves. RED Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear. ANDY What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place. . RED Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from. ANDY That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back... RED It's clean as a virgin's whistle? ANDY Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire. RED Jesus. They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself. ANDY (smiles) I thought you had more faith in me than that. RED I'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets too curious FBI, IRS, whatever that trail's gonna lead to somebody. ANDY Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden. RED Who then? ANDY Peter Stevens. RED Who? ANDY The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. (MORE) . That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him. RED Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he? ANDY A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. (off Red's look) I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn't exist...except on paper. RED You can't just make a person up. ANDY Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination. RED Jesus. Did I say you were good? You're Rembrandt. ANDY It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook. EXT PRISON YARD DUSK () RED Does it ever bother you? ANDY I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that? ANDY (CONT'D) . RED To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money instead of sheets. ANDY I work cheap. That's the tradeoff. TWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate. It swings open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside. INT PRISON BUS DUSK () Among those on board is TOMMY WILLIAMS, a damn goodlooking kid in his mid's. The bus RUMBLES through the gate. EXT PRISON YARD DUSK () The new fish disembark, chained together singlefile. The old timers holler and shake the fence. A deafening gauntlet. INT CELLBLOCK EIGHT NIGHT () Tommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering, covered with delousing powder, greeted by TAUNTS and JEERS. INT TOMMY'S CELL NIGHT () The bars slam with a STEEL CLANG. Tommy and his new CELLMATE take in their new surroundings. TOMMY Well. Ain't this for shit? INT PRISON CORRIDOR DAY () DOLLYING Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail, cigarette behind his ear. (We definitely need The Coasters or Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis.) RED (V.O.) Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in on a two year stretch for B&E. Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney. INT WOOD SHOP DAY () A SHRIEKING BUZZSAW slices tenfoot lengths of wood. Red runs the machine while some other OLDTIMERS feed the wood. . RED (V.O.) Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky as hell... Tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it, It's a ballbusting job, but the kid's a blur. TOMMY (slapping his gloves) C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like molasses! Makin' me look bad! The old guys just grin and shake their heads. RED (V.O.) We liked him immediately. INT MESS HALL DAY () Tommy regales the old boys with his exploits: TOMMY ...so I'm backin' out the door, right? Had the TV like this... (mimes his grip) Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. Suddenly, here's this voice: Freeze kid! Hands in the air! Well I just stand there holdin' on to that TV, so the voice says: """"You hear what I said, boy?"""" And I say, Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop this fuckin' thing, you got me on destruction of property too! The whole table falls about laughing. INT LIBRARY DAY () Poker game in progress. Tommy, Andy, Red and the boys. HEYWOOD You did a stretch in Cashman too? TOMMY Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me tell you. Work programs, weekend furloughs. Not like here. SNOOZE Sounds like you done time all over New England. . TOMNY Been in and out since I was . Name the place, chances are I been there. ANDY Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession. (the game stalls) What I mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief. Maybe you should try something else. TOMMY What the hell you know about it, Capone? What are you in for? ANDY (wry glance to Red) Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that? The tension breaks. Everyone laughs. INT VISITOR'S ROOM DAY () CAMERA TRAVELS the room. Chaotic. CONS are waiting their turn or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield. RED (V.O.) As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl... Tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. Other side of the glass is BETH, near tears, fussing with a BABY on her lap. BETH ...said we can stay with them, but Joey's gettin' out of the service next month, and they barely got enough room as it is. Plus they got Poppa workin' double shifts and the baby cries half the night. I just don't know where we're gonna go... PUSH IN on Tommy's face as he listens. RED (V.O.) Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets...or his child growing up not knowing her daddy... . INT LIBRARY DAY () Tommy enters, the strut gone from his step. A little scared. He finds Andy filing library cards. RED (V.O.) Whatever it was, something lit a fire under that boy's ass. TOMMY I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for high school equivalency. Hear you helped some fellas with that. ANDY I don't waste time on losers, Tommy. TOMNY (tight) I ain't no goddamn loser. ANDY That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing halfassed. Tommy thinks about it, nods. TOMMY Thing is, see... (leans in, mutters) ...I don't read all that good. ANDY (smiles) Well. You've come to the right place then. INT LIBRARY DAY () We find Andy giving an impassioned reading: ANDY ...and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! """" Andy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself. . TOMMY So this raven just sits there and won't go away? ANDY That's right. TOMMY (beat) Why don't that fella get hisself a and dust the fucker? INT LIBRARY DAY () Tommy tries to read as Andy looks on: TOMMY The cat shThe cat shh... (glances up) The cat shat on the welcome mat? Andy shakes his head. Not exactly. INT LIBRARY DAY () Andy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard. RED (V.O.) So Andy took Tommy under his wing. Started walking him through his ABCs... INT MESS HALL DAY () TRACK the table to Tommy and Andy. Discussing a book. RED (V.O.) Tommy took to it pretty well, too. Boy found brains he never knew he had. EXT EXERCISE YARD BLEACHERS DAY () TOMNY The cat shshhshimmied up the tree and crept ststelstealthily out on the limb... INT WOOD SHOP DAY () Tommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words. Behind him, wood is piling up on the conveyor belt. . RED (V.O.) After a while, you couldn't pry those books out of hands. RED Ass in gear, son! You're putting us behind! Tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over. INT LIBRARY DAY () Tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard. Andy steps in, shows him how to reconstruct it. RED (V.O.) Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements. He really liked the kid, that was part of it. Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap. But that wasn't the only reason... INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () TIGHT ANGLE on chessboard. Most of the pieces complete. PAN TO Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing... RED (V.O.) Prison time is slow time. Sometimes it feels like stoptime. So you do what you can to keep going... ...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. Sink. Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another TRAIN passing in the night... RED (V.O.) Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it. It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks. The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall... ...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and finally to the place of honor on the wall... RED (V.O.) In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied. . ...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins fur bikini. Gorgeous. """"One Million Years, B. C. """" SLOW PUSH IN, RED (V.O.) By ...right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...it was lovely Racquel. INT LIBRARY DAY () Tommy's taking the big test. Andy's monitoring the time. Deep silence, save for Tommy's pencilscribbling. A few old timers are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. Tommy tries to ignore them. Concentrate. Andy clears his throat. Time's up. Tommy puts his pencil down, ANDY Well? TOMMY Well. It's for shit. (gets up in disgust) Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my time with this bullshit! ANDY May not be as bad as you think. TOMMY It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' thing right! Might as well be in Chinese! ANDY We'll see how the score comes out. TOMMY I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out... Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slamdunks it into the trash. TOMMY (CONTD) Two points! Right there! There's your goddamn score! (storms out) Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, times is , fuck this place, fuck it! . Tommy is gone. Red and others stare. Andy gets up, pulls the test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk. INT WOOD SHOP DAY () Rest break. Tommy and Red sipping Cokes. TOMMY I feel bad. I let him down. RED That's crap, son. He's proud of you. Proud as a hen. (off Tommy's look) We been friends a long time. I know him as good as anybody. TOMMY Smart fella, ain't he? RED Smart as they come. Used to be a banker on the outside. TOMMY What's he in for anyway? RED Murder. TOMMY The hell you say. RED You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, boy, back to work... SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor. The kid's gone white as a sheet. TOMMY (bare whisper) Oh my God... INT LIBRARY DAY () Tommy sits before Andy and Red: TOMMY 'Bout four years ago, I was in Thomaston on a to stretch. (MORE) . Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. (beat) Few months left to go, I get a new cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of roomie you pray you don't get, know what I'm sayin'? to for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, highstrung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go three feet in the air. Talked all the time, too, that's the other thing. Never shut up. Places he'd been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. People that gave him shit, that's how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: """"Yeah? Who'd you kill?"""" So he says... BLATCH ...I got me this job one time bussin' tables at a country club. So I could case all the big rich pricks that come in. I pick out this guy, go in one night and do his place. He wakes up and gives me shit. So I killed him. Him and the tasty bitch he was with. (starts laughing) That's the best part! She's fuckin' this prick, see, this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy! Some hotshot banker. He's the one they pinned it on! They got him downMaine somewhere doin' time for the crime! Ain't that choice? He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter. INT PRISON LIBRARY DAY () Silence. Tommy has finished his story. Red is stunned...but Andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four. RED Andy? Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away. Doesn't look back. TOMMY (CONT'D) . INT NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () NORTON Well. I have to say, that's the most amazing story I ever heard. What amazes me most is you were taken in by it. ANDY Sir? NORTON It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you. He hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. He's young, not terribly bright. Not surprising he didn't know what a state he'd put you in. ANDY I think he's telling the truth. NORTON Let's say for a moment Blatch does exist. You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, """"Yes, I did it! I confess! By all means, please add a life term to my sentence!"""" ANDY It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial. NORTON That's assuming Blatch is even still there. Chances are excellent he'd be released by now. Excellent. ANDY They'd have his last known address. Names of relatives... (Norton shakes his head) Well it's a chance. isn't it? How can you be so obtuse? NORTON What? What did you call me? ANDY Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The country club will have his old time cards! Ws with his name on them! . NORTON (rises) Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business. Don't make it mine. This meeting's over. ANDY Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money! NORTON Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office, not anywhere! (slaps intercom) Get in here! Now! ANDY I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all. NORTON (as GUARDS enter) Solitary! A month! Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming: ANDY What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life? EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Mail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and the boys are parked on the bleachers. FLOYD A month in the hole. Longest damn stretch I ever heard of. TOMMY It's my fault. RED Like hell. You didn't pull the trigger, and you didn't convict him. . HEYWOOD Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I mean for real innocent? (Red nods) Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in here? RED Since '. Going on nineteen years. MAIL CALLER Thomas Williams! Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder. RED Board of Education. TOMMY The son of a bitch mailed it. RED Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt? TOMMY Thumb up my butt sounds better. He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter. TOMMY (CONTD) C'mon, just throw it away. Will you please? Just throw it away? Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless. RED Well, shit. INT VISITOR'S ROOM DAY () Tommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby waiting behind the thick plexi shield. He sits, doesn't pick up the phone. Just stares at Beth. She doesn't know what to make of it. He presses a piece of paper against the glass. A high school diploma. Her face lights up, blinking back tears. . INT SOLITARY WING NIGHT () LOW ANGLE on steel door. Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy, A rat scurries along the wall. FOOTSTEPS approach slowly. INT SOLITARY NIGHT () Andy listens in darkness. The FOOTSTEPS pause outside his door. The slot opens. An ELDERLY GUARD peers in. ELDERLY GUARD Kid passed. Cplus average. Thought you'd like to know. The slot closes. The FOOTSTEPS recede. Andy smiles. INT PRISON CORRIDOR NIGHT () We find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with bucket and pail. Mert Entwhistle comes into view. MERT Warden wants to talk. EXT PRISON NIGHT () A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, unlocks it. Tommy looks around. TOMMY Out here? MERT That's what the man said. Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loadingdock access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence. TOMMY Warden? Norton steps into the light. NORTON Tommy, we've got a situation here. I think you can appreciate that. TOMMY Yes sir, I sure can. . NORTON I tell you, son, this really came along and knocked my wind out. It's got me up nights, that's the truth. Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter. NORTON (CONTD) The right decision. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what that is. You understand? (Tommy nods) Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna move on this, there can't be the least little shred of doubt. I have to know if you what you told Dufresne was the truth. TOMMY Yes sir. Absolutely. NORTON Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...having placed your hand on the Good Book and taken an oath before Almighty God Himself? TOMMY Just gimme that chance. NORTON That's what I thought. Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as HIGH ANGLE FROM PLATE SHOP ROOF (SNIPER POV) a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs. THE SNIPER rapidfires a carbine BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! his face lit up by the muzzle flashes. Captain Hadley. TOMMY gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. He smacks the ground in a twitching, thrashing heap. Eyes wide and staring. Dead. . Surprise still stamped on his face. Silence now. Norton turns, strolls into darkness. INT SOLITARY WING DAY () GUARDS approach Andy's cell. The door is unlocked. Andy emerges slowly, blinking painfully at the light. INT/EXT PRISON DAY () Andy is marched along. Convicts stop to stare. INT NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () Andy is led in. The door is closed. Alone with Norton. Softly, NORTON Terrible thing. Man that young, less than a year to go, trying to escape. Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him, truly it did. ANDY I'm done. It stops right now. Get H&R Block to declare your income. Norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage. NORTON Nothing stops! NOTHING! (tight) Or you will do the hardest time there is. No more protection from the guards. I'll pull you out of that onebunk Hilton and put you in with the biggest bull queer I can find. You'll think you got fucked by a train! And the library? Gone! Sealed off brick by brick! We'll have us a little bookbarbecue in the yard! They'll see the flames for miles! We'll dance around it like wild Indians! Do you understand me? Are you catching my drift? SLOW PUSH IN on Andy's face. Eyes hollow. His beaten expression says it all... EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. . Red waits for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. Red hunkers down and joins him. Nothing is said for the longest time. And then, softly: ANDY My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book. Complained about it all the time. (pause) She was beautiful. I loved her. But I guess I couldn't show it enough. (softly) I killed her, Red. Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence. ANDY (CONTD) I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am. RED That don't make you a murderer. Bad husband, maybe. Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his shoulder a squeeze. RED (CONTD) Feel bad about it if you want. But you didn't pull the trigger. ANDY No. I didn't. Someone else did, and I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. RED Bad luck? Jesus. ANDY It floats around. Has to land on somebody. Say a storm comes through. Some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. The house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. (softly) I just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has. (glances to him) Think you'll ever get out of here? . RED Sure. When I got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs. ANDY Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo. RED Zihuatanejo? ANDY Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where I'd like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. (beat) You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things. Red stares at Andy, laughs. RED Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on the outside. Been in here too long. I'm an institutional man now. Like old Brooks Hatlen was. ANDY You underestimate yourself. RED Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who can get it for you. Out there, all you need are Yellow Pages. I wouldn't know where to begin. (derisive snort) Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare me to death, somethin' that big. ANDY Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel and that boat...I don't think it's too much to want. (MORE) . To look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free. RED Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do that to yourself! Talking shitty pipedreams! Mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's the way it is! ANDY You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying. Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and walks away. Red lunges to his feet. RED Andy? ANDY (turns back) Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? RED (nods) Lots of hayfields there. ANDY One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my ANDY (CONT.) (CONTD) wife to marry me. We'd gone for a picnic. We made love under that tree. I asked and she said yes. (beat) Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something buried under it I want you to have. ANDY (CONT'D) . RED What? What's buried there? ANDY You'll just have to pry up that rock and see. Andy turns and walks away. INT MESS HALL DAY () RED I tell you, the man was talkin' crazy. I'm worried, I truly am. SKEET We ought to keep an eye on him. JIGGER That's fine, during the day. But at night he's got that cell all to himself. HEYWOOD Oh Lord. Andy come down to the loading dock today. Asked me for a length of rope. Six foot long. SNOOZE Shit! You gave it to him? HEYWOOD Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I? FLOYD Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen? HEYWOOD How the hell was I s'pose to know? JIGGER Andy'd never do that. Never. They all look to Red. RED Every man's got a breaking point. EXT PRISON YARD ANGLE ON P.A. DUSK () VOICE (OVER P.A.) Report to your cellblocks for evening count. . BOOM DOWN to Red and the boys. Convicts drift past them. FLOYD Where the hell is he? HEYWOOD Probably still up in the warden's. TOWER GUARD (via bullhorn) YOU MEN! YOU HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT OR ZUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND? SKEET Christ. What do we do? FLOYD Nothing we can do. Not tonight. HEYWOOD Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all of us. Have a word with him. Ain't that right, Red? RED (unconvinced) Yeah. Sure. That's right. INT NORTON'S OFFICE NIGHT () Andy's working away. Norton pokes his head in. NORTON Licketysplit. I wanna get home. ANDY Just about done, sir. We follow Norton to his wife's sampler. He swings it aside, works the combination dial, opens the wall safe. Andy moves up, shoves in the black ledger and files. Norton shuts the safe. ANDY (CONTD) Three deposits tonight. Andy hands him the envelopes. Norton heads for the door. NORTON Get my stuff down t'laundry. And shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' like mirrors. (MORE) . (pauses at door) Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place just wasn't the same without you. Norton exits. Andy turns to the laundry. He opens the shoebox. Nice pair of dress shoes inside. He sighs, glances down at the old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet. INT NORTON'S OFFICE NIGHT () Andy is diligently shining Norton's shoes. INT PRISON CORRIDOR NIGHT () Andy trudges down the hallway, laundry slung over his shoulder, INT CELLBLOCK FIVE NIGHT () Andy nods to the GUARD. The guard BUZZES him through. INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red hears Andy coming, moves to the bars. He watches Andy come up to the second tier and pause before his cell. GUARD (O.S.) Open number twelve! Andy gazes directly at Red. A beat of eye contact. Red shakes his head. Don't do it. Andy smiles, eerily calm...and enters his cell. The door closes. KATHUMP! We hold on Red's face. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy is polishing a chess piece. VOICE (O.S.) Lights out! The lights bump off. He finishes polishing, holds up the piece to admire. A pawn. He sets it down with the others and we realize it's the final glance for the board. A full set. He gazes up at Racquel and smiles. Pulls a six foot length of rope from under his pillow. Lets it uncoil to the floor. INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold NORTON (CONT'D) . himself still. He feels like he might scream or shake to pieces. The seconds tick by, each an eternity. RED (V.O.) I have had some long nights in stir. Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade... A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred shadows jittering across the cell. A storm breaking. RED (V.O.) That was the longest night of my life... INT CELLBLOCK FIVE MORNING () KATHUMP! The master lock is thrown. The cons emerge from their cells and the headcount begins. Red looks back to see if Andy's in line. He's not. Suddenly the count stalls: GUARD Man missing on tier two! Cell ! The head bull, HAIG, checks his list: HAIG Dufresne? Get your ass out here, boy! You're holding up the show! (no answer) Don't make me come down there now! I'll thump your skull for you! Still no answer. Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard in hand. His men fall in behind. HAIG (CONTD) Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me behind! You better be sick or dead in there, I shit you not! They arrive at bars. Their faces go slack. Stunned. Softly: HAIG (CONTD) Oh my Holy God. REVERSE ANGLE reveals the cell is empty. Everything neat and tidy. Even the bunk is stowed. They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the Kleenex or the toothpaste. . CAMERA ROCKETS IN on Haig as he spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs: HAIG WHAT THE FUCK! INT NORTON'S OFFICE MORNING () Norton is kicking back with the morning paper. He notices ha dingy his shoes are. He glances at the shoebox on the desk. kicks his shoes off, opens the box and gulls out Andy's o grimy work shoes. He stares blankly. What the fuck indeed. An ALARM STARTS BLARING throughout the prison. He looks up. EXT PRISON DAY () Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING. NORTON I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that friend of his! HADLEY who? INT CELLBLOCK FIVE RED'S CELL DAY () Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards. NORTON Him. Red's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell. INT ANDY'S CELL DAY () Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up into a fine rage: NORTON What do you mean """"he just wasn't here?"""" Don't say that to me, Haig! Don't say that to me again! HAIG But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! NORTON I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig? . HAIG No sir! Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley. NORTON What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is! HADLEY Last night's count. NORTON You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? """"Dufresne."""" He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red. NORTON (CONTD) Well? RED Well what? NORTON I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! He must'a said something! RED No sir, he didn't! Norton spreads his arms evangeliststyle, spins slowly around. NORTON Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different? Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words: . NORTON (CONTD) It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's what this is! (SMASH) It's one big damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And everyone's in on it! (SMASH) Including her! He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. No smash. It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster where her navel used to be. You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand disappears into the wall. ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall. INT ANDY'S CELL MINUTES LATER () RORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's getting instructions from six different people at once. RED (V.O.) They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job... (they slap a flashlight in his hands) ...he was willing to go. INT TUNNEL DAY () Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly. RED (V.O.) Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something. INT VERTICAL SHAFT DAY () Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. . Rory's appears, shining his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. RED (V.O.) It was his third day on the job. RORY Warden? There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet across! Smells pretty damn bad! NORTON (O.S.) I don't care what it smells like! HADLEY (O.S.) Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time. RORY Hoowhee! Smell's gettin' worse! NORTON (O.S.) Never mind, I said! Just keep going! RORY Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In fact, it smells just like shit. His feet touch the ground or what he assumed was the ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it. RORY (CONTD) Oh God, that's what it is, it's shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd! INT ANDY'S CELL DAY () Red and others listen to violent barfing from below. RED (V.O.) And then came the unmistakable sound of Rory Tremont losing his last few meals. The whole cellblock heard it. I mean, it echoed. . That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder. INT SOLITARY WING NIGHT () Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door. RED (V.O.) I laughed myself right into solitary. Two week stretch. INT SOLITARY NIGHT () RED It's shit, it's shit, oh my God it's shit... He starts laughing all over again, fit to split. RED (V.O.) Andy once talked about doing easy time in the hole. Now I knew what he meant. EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON WIDE SHOT DAY () Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. RED (V.O.) In , Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank Prison. EXT FIELD DAY () Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. RED (V.O.) All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rockhammer damn near worn down to the nub. TROOPER g pulls the rockhammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces: A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO . of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the worn rockhammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. RED (V.O.) I remember thinking it would take a man six hundred years to tunnel through the wall with it. Andy did it in less than twenty. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Once again, we see Andy using the rockhammer to scratch his name into the cement. Suddenly, a palmsized chunk of cement pops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. RED (V.O.) Andy loved geology. I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, a million years of mountainbuilding there, plates of bedrock grinding against each other over a span of millennia... INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen chunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. RED (V.O.) Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure and time. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back. RED (V.O.) That and a big damn poster. TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete. RED (V.O.) Like I said. In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied. . He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his flashlight into the cell. EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out. RED (V.O.) It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time... INT ND TIER NIGHT () A GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the cells. He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the sleeping form huddled under the blankets. p REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INSDE ANDY'S CELL) We see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under the blanket, it's a waddedup pillow. The flashlight plays across the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light. ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER The light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to reveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The light clicks off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work. RED (V.O.) While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years workin' the nightshift... INT SHAFT NIGHT () BOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets down the shaft as the rockhammer pushes through. The pick withdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ( through ) takes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a tea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate. . RED (V.O.) Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through. Andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's got a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the shaft. At the very bottom, maybe feet down, a big ceramic pipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of grime and dust, the word """"SEWER"""" is stenciled. EXT LOADING DOCK ACCESS NIGHT () ANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies facedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa the pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame. RED (V.O.) I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough. Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. NORTON Licketysplit. I wanna get home. ANDY Just about done, sir. Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, and shoves everything in. INT HALLWAY NIGHT () Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling Norton's dress shoes from their box. RED (V.O.) Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine. INT NORTON'S OFFICE MINUTES LATER () Andy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking the gray pinstripe. Nice. . INT CELLBLOCK FIVE NIGHT () The guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us. RED (V.O.) The guard simply didn't notice. Neither did I. I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes? TILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () The lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's gray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the cell, throwing wild shadows. INT ANDY'S CELL NIGHT () The storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded suit into a large industrial ZipLock bag. Next to go in are the shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. INT TUNNEL NIGHT () Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. INT SHAFT NIGHT () Andy squeezes through the hole headfirst, emerges to the waist, He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel conduit with his fingers. Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and almost plummets headfirst down the shaft. He dangles wildly upsidedown for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat scurries off, pissed. Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack, He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit his back against one wall and feet against the other, he starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for handholds. . Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. Pulls out the rockhammer and says a quick silent prayer. Raises the rockhammer high and swings it down with all his might. Once, twice third time lucky. An enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if rocketpropelled, the Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming. INT SEWER PIPE NIGHT () Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight around, The inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. Coated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. No turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts crawling, plastic bag dragging behind. RED (V.O.) Andy crawled to freedom through five hundred yards of shitsmelling foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to. EXT FIELD NIGHT () Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile distant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. RED (V.O.) Five hundred yards. The length of five football fields. Just shy of half a mile. Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavygauge wire mesh covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, pushes himself out, and plunges headfirst into the creek. He comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist deep. He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon. INT ANDY'S TUNNEL DAY () Once again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK. . RED (V.O.) The next morning, right about the time Racquel was spilling her little secret... INT CASCO BANK OF PORTLAND MORNING () The door opens. Spitshined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to the counter. RED (V.O.) ...a man nobody ever laid eyes on before strolled into the Casco Bank of Portland. Until that moment, he didn't exist except on paper. FEMALE TELLER (O.S.) May I help you? TILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit. ANDY My name is Peter Stevens. I've come to close out some accounts. INT BANK SHORTLY LATER () The teller is cutting a cashier's check while the MANAGER carefully examines Mr. Stevens' various I.D.s. RED (V.O.) He had all the proper I.D. Driver's license, birth certificate, social security card. The signature was a spoton match. MANAGER I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business. I hope you'll enjoy living abroad. ANDY Thank you. I'm sure I will. TELLER Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else? ANDY Please. Would you add this to your outgoing mail? He hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a pleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank. . RED (V.O.) Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning. All told, he blew town with better than thousand dollars of Warden Norton's money. Severance pay for nineteen years. INT OFFICE DAY () A MAN in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. He finds Andy's package, rips it open. Pulls out the black ledger and files. Scans a cover letter. Holy shit. He dashes to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the glass: """"PORTLAND DAILY BUGLE Editor In Chief."""" MAN Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here! INT SHAWSHANK PRISON DAY () Norton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning paper in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into his office. Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk. The headline reads: """"CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK."""" Below that, the subheadline: """"D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments Expected."""" Norton looks up as SIRENS SWELL in the distance. EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON WIDE SHOT DAY () For the second time, State Police cruisers go rocketing up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. INT NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () Norton opens his safe and pulls out the """"ledger"""" it's Andy's Bible. The title page is inscribed by hand: """"Dear Warden. You were right. Salvation lay within."""" Norton flips to the center of the book and finds the pages hollowed out in the shape of a rockhammer. EXT PRISON DAY () Police cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle for position. A colorless DISTRICT ATTORNEY steps forward into CLOSEUP, flanked by a contingent of S.ATE TROOPERS. D.A. Byron Hadley? ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Captain Hadley. Staring. Waiting. . D.A. (CONTD) You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say will be used against you in court... TROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face scrunches up. He begins to cry. RED (V.O.) I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away. Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow. INT NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () Norton is staring out the window as they approach the building. He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a revolver and a box of shells. RED (V.O.) Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly. INT PRISON CORRIDORS DAY () The D.A. marches along amidst a phalanx of TROOPERS. INT NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () Norton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him. The doorknob rattles, a VOICE is heard: D.A. (O.S.) Samuel Norton? We have a warrant for your arrest! Open up! The POUNDING starts. Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr desk. He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes. OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he fumbles nervously with a huge key ring. DUTY GUARD I'm not sure which one it is... . He starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding in one after another... INT NORTON'S OFFICE DAY () ...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in all directions as Norton raises the gun and jams it under his chin. His head snaps back as the wall goes red. His swivel chair does a slow halfturn and creaks to a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. RED (V.O.) I like to think the last thing that went through his head...other than that bullet...was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him. PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson for today: """"HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON."""" EXT PRISON YARD DAY () Mail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard. RED (V.O.) Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark said, """"McNary, Texas."""" INT LIBRARY DAY () Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page. RED (V.O.) McNary. Right on the border. That's where Andy crossed. (shuts the book) When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it makes me laugh all over again... EXT MEXICO HIGHWAY DAY () A red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar jutting from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie. . RED (V.O.) Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific. INT MESS HALL DAY () Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy. RED (V.O.) Those of us who knew him best talk about him often. I swear, the stuff he pulled. It always makes us laugh. A wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy. RED (V.O.) Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are just too bright... EXT FIELDS LATE DAY () Convicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback. RED (V.O.) ...and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice...but still, the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins. RED (V.O.) I guess I just miss my friend. INT PRISON CELL NIGHT () Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start. RED (V.O.) But there are times I curse him for the dreams he left behind... . He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner papers, book, toiletries, bedding if it ain't nailed down, it gets sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the suction drags him closer and closer... RED'S POV ...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing with his drawnout SCREAM, closer and closer to the light... ...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. Mindblowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now are the gentle sound of waves. RED (V.O.) ...dreams where I am lost in a warm place with no memory. A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal Red. RED (V.O.) An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. Sunshine so bright it strikes me blind. It is a place that is blue beyond reason. Bluer than can possibly exist. Bluer than my mind can possibly grasp. AERIAL SHOT Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand. RED (V.O.) I am terrified. There is no way home. INT RED'S CELL NIGHT () Red wakes from the nightmare. He gets out of bed. Moves to the barred window of his cell. Peers up at the stars. . RED (V.O.) Andy. I know you're in that place. Look at the stars for me just after sunset. Touch the sand...wade in the water...and feel free. FADE TO BLACK AN IRONBARRED DOOR slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SIX MEN AND ONE WOMAN sit at a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: INT SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM DAY () Red enters, sits. years older than when we first saw him. MAN # Your file says you've served forty years of a life sentence. You feel you've been rehabilitated? Red doesn't answer. Just stares off. Seconds tick by. The parole board exchanges glances. Somebody clears his throat. MAN # (CONTD) Shall I repeat the question? RED I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's see now. You know, come to think of it, I have no idea what that means. MAN # Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society as a RED I know what you think it means. Me, I think it's a madeup word, a poli tician's word. A word so young fellas like you can wear a suit and tie and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did? MAN # Well...are you? RED Not a day goes by I don't feel regret, and not because I'm in here or because you think I should. (MORE) . I look back on myself the way I was...stupid kid who did that terrible crime...wish I could talk sense to him. Tell him how things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, this old man is all that's left, and I have to live with that. (beat) Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit word, so you just go on ahead and stamp that form there, sonny, and stop wasting my damn time. Truth is, I don't give a shit. The parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers. CLOSEUP PAROLE FORM A big rubber stamp SLAMS down and lifts away to reveal the word """"APPROVED"""" in red ink. EXT SHAWSHANK PRISON DAY TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still looking stunned. INT BUS DAY Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by terror of speed and motion. EXT BREWSTER HOTEL LATE AFTERNOON Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less to look at than it used to be. INT BREWSTER LATE DAY A BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor. INT RED'S ROOM LATE DAY Small, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress Street. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, staring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the words: """"Brooks Hatlen was here."""" INT FOODWAY MARKET DAY Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red calls to the STORE MANAGER: RED (CONT'D) . RED Sir? Restroom break sir? MANAGER (motions him over) You don't need to ask me every time you go take a piss. Just go. Understand? INT EMPLOYEE RESTROOM DAY Red steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror. RED (V.O.) Thirty years I've been asking permission to piss. I can't squeeze a drop without sayso. A strange east Indian guitarwhine begins. The Beatles. George Harrison's """"Within You Without You..."""" EXT STREET DAY ...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He keeps looking at the women. An alien species. RED (V.O.) Women, too, that's the other thing. I forgot they were half the human race. There's women everywhere, every shape and size. I find myself semihard most of the time, cursing myself for a dirty old man. TWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cutoffs and tshirts. RED (V.O.) Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples poking out at the world. Jeezus, pleezeus. Back in my day, a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing. EXT PARK DUSK Red finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. Happening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE GIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world. . RED (V.O.) They're calling this the Summer of Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me. INT PAROLE OFFICE DAY Red sits across from his PAROLE OFFICER. The P.O. is filling out his report. P.O. You staying out of the bars, Red? RED Yes sir. That I am. P.O. How you doing otherwise? Adjusting okay? RED Things got different out here. P.O. Tell me about it. Young punks protesting the war. You imagine? Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his fuckin' skull. RED Guess the world moved on. INT FOODWAY DAY Bagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at Red, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to it CLICKETYCLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. The kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next customer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE. Feeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, whipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him from all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. He's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake himself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the bag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. He makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps into a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks into a trot. . Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming through a door marked """"Employees Only"""" into INT EMPLOYEE RESTROOM DAY where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, shutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. He enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and touch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. He'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down. EXT STREET DUSK Red is walking home. RED (V.O.) There is a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. He pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns. RED (V.O.) All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole. The SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and flipping the sign: CLOSED. INT RED'S ROOM NIGHT Red lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. RED (V.O.) Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. He glances up at the ceiling beam. """"Brooks Hatlen was here."""" . RED (V.O.) Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy. EXT COUNTRY ROAD MORNING A pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to a stop. Red hops off the back, waves his thanks. The truck drives on. Red starts walking. PAN TO a roadside sign: BUXTON. EXT MAINE COUNTRYSIDE DAY High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. The trees fiery with autumn color. Red walks the fields and backroads, cheap compass in hand. Looking for a certain hayfield. EXT COUNTRYSIDE DAY Walking. Searching. The day turning late. Red finds himself staring at a distant field. There's a long rock wall, like something out o f a Robert Frost poem. Big oak tree. Red checks his compass. North end. He crosses a dirt road into the field. EXT HAYFIELD DAY Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies the base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of rocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. Something catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering closer. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes off. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock out, anticipation growing. It won't come; it's too smooth. He pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his feet, leaving a ragged hole. Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the object buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped in plastic. Written on it is a single word: """"Red."""" Red pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for a while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside is a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read: ANDY (V.O.) Dear Red. If you're reading this, you've gotten out. (MORE) . And if you've come this far, maybe you're willing to come a little further. You remember the name of the town, don't you? I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels. I'll keep an eye out for you and the chessboard ready. (beat) Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy. By now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty dollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars. INT RED'S ROOM DAY () Red is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. RED (V.O.) Get busy living or get busy dying. That is goddamn right. He steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight. INT BREWSTER RED'S DOOR DAY () The door opens. Red exits with his bag and heads down the stairs, leaving the door open. CAMERA PUSHES through, BOOMING UP to the ceiling beam which reads: """"Brooks Hatlen was here."""" A new message has been carved alongside the old: """"So was Red."""" INT GREYHOUND BUS STATION DAY () TRACKING SHOT reveals a long line of people at the counter. RED (V.O.) For the second time in my life, I am guilty of committing a crime. CAMERA brings us to Red, next in line, bag by his feet. ANDY (V.O.) (CONT'D) . RED (V.O.) Parole violation. I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that. Not for an old crook like me. RED (steps up) McNary, Texas? EXT TRAVELING SHOT DAY () A gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees a blur of motion. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni Cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. CAMERA TRAVELS from window to window, passing faces. We finally come to Red gazing out at the passing landscape. RED (V.O.) I find I am so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it is the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain... THE BUS ROARS past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon. RED (V.O.) I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. (beat) I hope. EXT BEACH WIDE PANORAMIC SHOT DAY () A distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck that's been left to rot in the sun. There's someone out there. CLOSER ON BOAT A MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by hand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask. Red appears b.g., a distant figure walking out across the sand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag. . The man on the boat pauses. Turns slowly around. Red arrives with a smile as wide as the horizon. The other man raises his goggles and pulls down his mask. Andy, of course. ANDY You look like a man who knows how to get things. RED I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. Red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander. Together, they start sanding the hull as we FADE OUT THE END . """
Titanic,tt0120338,1998,Oscar,"""THIS SCRIPT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY """"Titanic"""" a screenplay by James Cameron Cast: KATE WINSLET... Rose DeWitt Bukater LEONARDO DICAPRIO... Jack Dawson KATHY BATES... The Unsinkable Molly Brown BILLY ZANE... Caledon Hockley BILL PAXTON... Brock Lovett Written and Directed by: JAMES CAMERON BLACKNESS Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free falling toward us like express elevators. One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile manipulators. TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness below. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone. CUT TO: EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to its circular viewport to see the occupants. INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing softly in Russian. Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fasttalking treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO scrubber, fast asleep and snoring. On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded widebody named LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert. (CONTINUED) Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment. CUT TO: EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA A pale, deadflat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its thrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour freefall with a loud BONK. CUT TO: INT. MIR ONE Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing. ANATOLY (heavy Russian accent) We are here. EXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters. The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs. Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center port. BODINE Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen... you should see it. ANATOLY Do you see it? I don't see it... there! Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship appears. Its knifeedge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed years ago. THE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow railing, intact except for an overgrowth of """"rusticles"""" draping it like mutated Spanish moss. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's face fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME. LOVETT It still gets me every time. The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns. ANATOLY Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead. CUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it in his hand so it points at his own face. LOVETT Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here. Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length. LOVETT (CONT'D) It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at : in the morning, April , , after her long fall from the world above. Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches the sonar. BODINE You are so full of shit, boss. Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming. The foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck. LOVETT (V.O.) Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. . CONTINUED: (MORE) (CONTINUED) These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds. Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby. LOVETT (CONT'D) Right. Let's go to work. Bodine slips on a pair of D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick controls of the ROV. OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward. BODINE (V.O.) Walkin' the dog. SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind it like a robot yoyo. Its twin stereo video cameras swivel like insect eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful First Class Grand Staircase. Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First Class Reception Room. SNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again. MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence: A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights. A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as Snoop moves around it. Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high top """"granny shoe"""". Then something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll. Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges. . CONTINUED: () LOVETT (V.O.) (cont'd) (CONTINUED) An ornate piece of molding, a wall sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past. THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B, the sitting room of a """"promenade suite"""", one of the most luxurious staterooms on Titanic. BODINE (CONT'D) I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B. LOVETT Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday. BODINE I'm tryin' boss. Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near perfectly preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe, scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going. BODINE (CONT'D) I'm crossing the bedroom. The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in the dark. LOVETT Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door. SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were in . LOVETT (CONT'D) Easy, Lewis. Take it slow. Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door... BODINE Ooohh daddyoh, are you seein' what I'm seein'? . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) CLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is seeing the Holy Grail. LOVETT Oh baby baby baby. (grabs the mike) It's payday, boys. ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE. CUT TO: EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KEDYSH DAY THE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a ship by a winch cable. We are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowd has gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and a handwringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited partners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover his moment of glory. Everyone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two is being lowered into its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm. Mir One is already recovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the safe like a kid on Christman morning. BODINE Who's the best? Say it. LOVETT You are, Lewis. (to the video crew) You rolling? CAMERAMAN Rolling. Brock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling the safe's hinges. During this operation, Brock amps the suspense, working the lens to fill the time. LOVETT Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. . CONTINUED: () (MORE) (CONTINUED) If what we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be. Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The door is pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering into the safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all. LOVETT (CONT'D) Shit. BODINE You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered. LOVETT (to the video cameraman) Get that outta my face. CUT TO: INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION ROOM DAY Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing them in a tray of water to separate them safely. Nearby, other artifacts from the stateroom are being washed and preserved. Buell is on the satellite phone with the INVESTORS. Lovett is yelling at the video crew. LOVETT You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks, not minutes. Now get set up for the uplink. Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett. BUELL The partners want to know how it's going? LOVETT How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?! Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth. LOVETT (CONT'D) Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... . CONTINUED: LOVETT (cont'd) (MORE) (CONTINUED) no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck... (seeing something) Hang on a second. A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong... revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman. Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its edges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifully rendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed with a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lower right corner is the date: April . And the initials JD. The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with one large stone hanging in the center. Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is a period blackandwhite photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet jeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly the same piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which is almost heartshaped. LOVETT (CONT'D) I'll be God damned. CUT TO: INSERT A CNN NEWS STORY: a live satellite feed from the deck of the Keldysh, intercut with the CNN studio. ANNOUNCER Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold in sunken galleons in the Caribbean. Now he is using deep submergence technology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck... the Titanic. He is with us live via satellite from a Russian research ship in the middle of the Atlantic... hello Brock? . CONTINUED: LOVETT (CONT'D) (CONTINUED) LOVETT Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks. CUT TO: INT. HOUSE / CERAMICS STUDIO PULL BACK from the screen, showing the CNN report playing on a TV set in the living room of a small rustic house. It is full of ceramics, figurines, folk art, the walls crammed with drawings and paintings... things collected over a lifetime. PANNING to show a glassedin studio attached to the house. Outside it is a quiet morning in Ojai, California. In the studio, amid incredible clutter, an ANCIENT WOMAN is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel. The liquid red clay covers her hands... hands that are gnarled and agespotted, but still surprisingly strong and supple. A woman in her early forties assists her. LOVETT (V.O.) I've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering some amazing things... things that will have enormous historical and educational value. CNN REPORTER (V.O.) But it's no secret that education is not your main purpose. You're a treasure hunter. So what is the treasure you're hunting? LOVETT (V.O.) I'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing just that. The old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled mass, her body shapeless and shrunken under a one piece Africanprint dress. But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl. Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from her hands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) The younger soman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her. ROSE Turn that up please, dear. REPORTER (V.O.) Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage rights and even ethics. Many are calling you a grave robber. TIGHT ON THE SCREEN. LOVETT Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave robbing. I have museumtrained experts here, making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found today... The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. The image of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME. LOVETT (CONT'D) ...a piece of paper that's been underwater for years... and my team are able to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...? ROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement. ROSE I'll be God damned. CUT TO: EXT. KELDYSH DECK NIGHT CUT TO KELDYSH. The Mir subs are being launched. Mir Two is already in the water, and Lovett is getting ready to climb into Mir One when Bobby Buell runs up to him. BUELL There's a satellite call for you. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) LOVETT Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message. BUELL No, trust me, you want to take this call. CUT TO: INT. LAB DECK / KELDYSH NIGHT Beull hands Lovett the phone, pushing down the blinking line. The call is from Rose and we see both ends of the conversation. She is in her kitchen with a mystified Lizzy. LOVETT This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ? BUELL Rose Calvert. LOVETT ... Mrs. Calvert? ROSE I was just wondering if you had found the """"Heart of the Ocean"""" yet, Mr. Lovett. Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression... BUELL I told you you wanted to take this call. LOVETT (to Rose) Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is? ROSE Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: EXT. OCEAN DAY SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across the ocean. PAN degrees as it roars past. There is no land at either horizon. The Keldysh is visible in the distance. CLOSE ON A WINDOW of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible, looking out calmly. CUT TO: EXT. KELDYSH DAY Brock and Bodine are watching Mir being sweng over the side to start a dive. BODINE She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe. BUELL They're inbound. Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo. BODINE She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of . If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. LOVETT A hundred and one next month. BODINE Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead. The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the rotors. . (CONTINUED) LOVETT And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say. Got it? CUT TO: EXT. KELDYSH HELIPAD IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on the helipad. Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out about ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by Keldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her out, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel light. HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic equipment. BODINE S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends. CUT TO: INT. ROSE'S STATEROOM / KELDYSH DAY Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway. LOVETT Is your stateroom alright? ROSE Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. LIZZY Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck? ROSE Oh, yes. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband. ROSE (CONT'D) There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. (to the Pomeranian) Isn't that right, sweetie. LOVETT Would you like anything? ROSE I should like to see my drawing. CUT TO: INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across a span of years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it, they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive. TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing. FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines. THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water. A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly direct. Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace in his hand. LOVETT Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in , about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heartlike shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. . CONTINUED: (MORE) (CONTINUED) Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. ROSE It was a dreadful, heavy thing. (she points at the drawing) I only wore it this once. LIZZY You actually believe this is you, grandma? ROSE It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? LOVETT I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost? ROSE Someone named Hockley, I should imagine. LOVETT Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. (to Lizzy) See the date? LIZZY April , . LOVETT If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. LOVETT (CONT'D) (to Rose) And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery. . CONTINUED: LOVETT (cont'd) (CONTINUED) ROSE I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who care greatly for money to give some away. BODINE (skeptical) You don't want anything? ROSE (indicating the drawing) You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value. LOVETT Deal. (crossing the room) Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms. Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable. Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top. With a trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother of pearl. She caresses it wonderingly. ROSE This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw it. She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked glass. ROSE (CONT'D) The reflection has changed a bit. She spies something else, a silver and moonstone artnouveau brooch. ROSE (CONT'D) My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss. Rose picks up an ornate artnouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takes flight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering. We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) LOVETT Are you ready to go back to Titanic? CUT TO: INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH It is a darkened room lined with TV monitors. IMAGES OF THE WRECK fill the screens, fed from Mir One and Two, and the two ROVs, Snoop Dog and DUNCAN. BODINE Live from , feet. ROSE stares raptly at the screens. She is enthraled by one in particular, an image of the bow railing. It obviously means something to her. Brock is studying her reactions carefully. BODINE The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here. Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer. As he is calling up the file, he keeps talking. BODINE We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here... LOVETT Rose might not want to see this, Lewis. ROSE No, no. It's fine. I'm curious. Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallels his rapidfire narration. BODINE She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along... punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's flooding in the . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) BODINE (CONT'D) forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up... slow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that weight, maybe or thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can't deal... so SKRTTT!! (making a sound in time with the animation) ... it splits! Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. Now the bow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bow pulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for the bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about : a.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision. The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion. BODINE The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe miles an hour. KABOOM! The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows the stern. BODINE The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk. (indicating the simulation) Cool huh? ROSE Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical. LOVETT Will you share it with us? . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them. A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Rose recognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostly waltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, English accented, calling """"Women and children only"""". FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium and terror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions... flashes in the dark. Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted, debrisfilled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding past, like dark mouths. IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the middle of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying. Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her eyes well up and she puts her head down, sobbing quietly. LIZZY (taking the wheelchair) I'm taking her to rest. ROSE No! Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady is gone, replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett signals everyone to stay quiet. LOVETT Tell us, Rose. She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship. ROSE It's been years... LOVETT Just tell us what you can ROSE (holds up her hand for silence) It's been years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. . CONTINUED: (MORE) (CONTINUED) The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in. He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her. ROSE Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was... As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE DISSOLVE / MATCH MOVE to that same railing in ... MATCH DISSOLVE: EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK DAY SHOT CONTINUES IN A FLORIOUS REVEAL as the gleaming white superstructure of Titanic rises mountainously beyond the rail, and above that the buffcolored funnels stand against the sky like the pillars of a great temple. Crewmen move across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the steamer. Southanmpton, England, April , . It is almost nnon on ailing day. A crowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to Titanic like ants on a jelly sandwich. IN FG a gorgeous burgundy RENAULT TOURING CAR swings into frame, hanging from a loading crane. It is lowered toward HATCH #. On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly through the dense throng. The atmosphere is one of excitement and general giddiness. People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bon voyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above. A white RENAULT, leading a silvergray DAIMLERBENZ, pushes through the crowd leaving a wake in the press of people. Around the handsome cars people are streaming to board the ship, jostling with hustling seamen and stokers, porters, and barking WHITE STAR LINE officials. The Renault stops and the LIVERIED DRIVER scurries to open the door for a YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit, with an enormous feathered hat. She is years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, with piercing eyes. It is the girl in the drawing. ROSE. She looks up at the ship, taking it in with cool appraisal. . CONTINUED: () ROSE (cont'd) (CONTINUED) ROSE I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the Mauretania. A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON HOCKLEY, the year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. """"Cal"""" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning. CAL You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths. Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who descends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a ish society empress, from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and rules her household with iron will. CAL Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. (indicating a puddle) Mind your step. RUTH (gazing at the leviathan) So this is the ship they say is unsinkable. CAL It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship. Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience. This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and Rose. A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) PORTER Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round that way Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes dilate. Five pounds was a monster tip in those days. CAL I put my faith in you, good sir. CAL (CONT'D) (curtly, indicating Lovejoy) See my man. PORTER Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir. Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses. LOVEJOY (to the porter) These trunks here, and more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up in the rooms. The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates and steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargohandlers nearby who come running. Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his pocket watch. CAL We'd better hurry. This way, ladies. He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage handlers. Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers (mostly second class and steerage) and well wishers. Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice. They pass a welldressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph """"cinematograph"""" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious. DANIEL Look up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believe how big it is! Like a mountain. That's great. Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bow pantomime of awe, hands raised. Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him. And he is bumped again a second later by the boys' father. CAL Steady!! MAN Sorry squire! The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting. CAL Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. RUTH Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family. CAL All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late. ROSE You told me to change. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) CAL I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. ROSE I felt like black. Cal guides them out of the path of a horsedrawn wagon loaded down with two tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling Department. CAL Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution. Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall, Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway to the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread. OLD ROSE (V.O.) It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains. CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOWMOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them. OLD ROSE (V.O.) Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming. CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, bellowing their departure warning. CUT TO: EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS / TITANIC DAY A VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city. The steamer's whistle echoes across Southampton. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) PULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is crowded with dockworkers and ship;s crew. Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR MEN, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand. JACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about , exchange a glance as the other two players argue in Swedish. Jack is American, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times. He is also unshaven, and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He is also very selfpossessed and surefooted for , having lived on his own since . The TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish. OLAF (subtitled) You stupid fishhead. I can't believe you bet our tickets. SVEN (subtitled) You lost our money. I'm just trying to get it back. Now shutup and take a card. JACK (jaunty) Hit me again, Sven. Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand. ECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing. CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card. ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties. This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two RD CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC. The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning. JACK The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change. Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds his close. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. (turns to his friend) Sorry Fabrizio. FABRIZIO What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo JACK Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time... He slaps a full house down on the table. JACK (grinning) 'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys! FABRIZIO Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!! The table explodes into shouting in several languages. Jack rakes in the money and the tickets. JACK (to the Swedes) Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and... (to Fabrizio) ... we're going to FABRIZIO/JACK L'AMERICA!!! Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to clobber Jack, but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and sits there, looking depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who are dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin. Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and rides him around the pub. It's like they won the lottery. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) JACK Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!! FABRIZIO You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!! FABRIZIO (CONT'D) (to pubkeeper) Capito?? I go to America!! PUBKEEPER No, mate. Titanic go to America. In five minutes. JACK Shit!! Come on, Fabri! (grabbing their stuff) Come on!! (to all, grinning) It's been grand. They run for the door. PUBKEEPER 'Course I'm sure if they knew it was you lot comin', they'd be pleased to wait! CUT TO: OMITTED EXT. TERMINAL TITANIC Jack and Fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world in the kit bags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier. They tear through milling crowds next to the terminal. Shouts go up behind them as they jostle slowmoving gentlemen. They dodge piles of luggage, and weave through groups of people. They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead stop... staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven stories above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. The Titanic is monstrous. Fabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward the third class gangway aft, at E deck. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) They reach the bottom of the ramp just as SIXTH OFFICER MOODY detaches it at the top. It starts to swing down from the gangway doors. JACK Wait!! We're passengers! Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets. MOODY Have you been through the inspection queue? JACK (lying cheerfully) Of course! Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans. (glances at Fabrizio) Both of us. MOODY (testy) Right, come aboard. Moody has QUARTERMASTER ROWE reattach the gangway. Jack and Fabrizio come aboard. Moody glances at the tickets, then passes Jack and Fabrizio through to Rowe. Rowe looks at the names on the tickets to enter them in the passenger list. ROWE Gundersen. And... (reading Fabrizio's) Gundersen. He hands the tickets back, eyeing Fabrizio's Mediterranean looks suspiciously. JACK (grabbing Fabrizio's arm) Come on, Sven. Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the whitepainted corridero... grinning from ear to ear. JACK We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world! CUT TO: OMITTED . CONTINUED: EXT. TITANIC AND DOCK DAY The mooring lines, as big around as a man's arm, are dropped into the water. A cheer goes up on the pier as SEVEN TUGS pull the Titanic away from the quay. CUT TO: EXT. AFT WELL DECK / POOP DECK DAY JACK AND FABRIZIO burst through a door onto the aft well deck. TRACKING WITH THEM as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poop deck. They get to the rail and Jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on the dock. FABRIZIO You know somebody? JACK Of course not. That's not the point. (to the crowd) Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you! Grinning, Fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices, feeling the exhilaration of the moment. FABRIZIO Goodbye! I will never forget you!! CUT TO: OMITTED EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK DAY The crowd of cheering wellwishers waves heartily as a black wall of metal moves past them. Impossibly tiny figues wave back from the ship's rails. Titanic gathers speed. CUT TO: EXT. RIVER TEST DAY IN A LONG LENS SHOT the prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind the lead tug, which is dwarfed. The bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the liner's hull as it moves down the River Test toward the English Channel. CUT TO: . INT. THIRD CLASS BERTHING / GDECK FORWARD DAY Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sides like a college dorm. Total confusion as people argue over luggage in several languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth. They pass emigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words in phrase books. They find their berth. It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel white, with four bunks. Exposed pipes overhead. The other two guys are already there. OLAUS and BJORN GUNDERSEN. Jack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes the other. BJORN (in Swedish/ subtitled) Where is Sven? CUT TO: INT. SUITE B DAY By contrast, the socalled """"Millionaire Suite"""" is in the Empire style, and comprises two bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe room, and a large sitting room. In addition there is a private foot promenade deck outside. A room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juice and hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose. She is looking through her new paintings. There is a Monet of water lilies, a Degas of dancers, and a few abstract works. They are all unknown paintings... lost works. Cal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and vines on trellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in the sitting room. CAL Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money. ROSE (looking at a cubist portrait) You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again... ? (reading off the canvas) Picasso. . (CONTINUED) CAL (coming into the sitting room) He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap. A porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on a handtruck. CAL Put that in the wardrobe. IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She sets it on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hanging up some of Rose's clothes. TRUDY It smells so brand new. Like they built it all just for us. I mean... just to think that tonight, when I crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first Cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom. CAL (looking at Rose) And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first. TRUDY (blushing at the innuendo) S'cuse me, Miss. She edges around Cal and makes a quick exit. Cal comes up behind Rose and puts his hands on her shoulders. An act of possession, not intimacy. CAL The first and only. Forever. Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now. CUT TO: EXT. CHERBOURG HARBOR, FRANCE LATE DUSK Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple postsunset sky. She is lit up like a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the calm harbor waters. The foot tender Nomadic liesto alongside, looking like a rowboat. .

FIRST CLASS RECEPTION/ DDECK Entering the first class reception room from the tender are a number of prominent passengers. A BROADSHOULDERED WOMAN in an enormous feathered hat comes up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter running to catch up with her to take the bags. WOMAN Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest of the way if you think you can manage. OLD ROSE (V.O.) At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called """"new money"""". At , MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them. OLD ROSE (V.O.) By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean... CUT TO: OMITTED EXT. BOW DAY The ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon. Jack and Fabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving railing so familiar from images of the wreck. Jack leans over, looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of water. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: INT. / EXT. TITANIC SERIES OF SCENES DAY ON THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST OFFICER WILLIAM MURDOCH. CAPTAIN SMITH Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs. Murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to ALL AHEAD FULL. NOW BEGINS a kind of musical/visual setpiece... an ode to the great ship. The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with a soaring melody that addresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams. IN THE ENGINE ROOM the telegraph clangs and moves to """"All Ahead Full"""". CHIEF ENGINEER BELL All ahead full! On the catwalk THOMAS ANDREWS, the shipbuilder, watches carefully as the engineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves. Towering above them are the twin RECIPROCATING engines, four stories tall, their tenfootlong connecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive crankshafts. The engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants. IN THE BOILER ROOMS the STOKERS chant a song as they hurl coal into the roaring furnaces. The """"black gang"""" are covered with sweat and coal dust, their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in the hellish glow. UNDERWATER the enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurling the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for miles behind the juggernaut ship. Smoke pours from the funnels as The riven water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds builds. THE CAMERA SWEEPS UP the prow to find Jack, the wind streaming through his hair and Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing. He stands with his hands on the rail, looking every bit the storybook picture of a Captain... a great patriarch of the sea. . FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH Twenty one knots, sir! SMITH She's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr. Murdoch. Smith accepts a cup of tea from FIFTH OFFICER LOWE. He contentedly watches the white V of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his own personal power. They are invulnerable, towering over the sea. AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down. In the glassy bowwave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow. They do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion. Jack watches the dolphins and grins. They breach, jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut. FABRIZIO looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles. FABRIZIO I can see the Statue of Liberty already. (grinning at Jack) Very small... of course. THE CAMERA ARCS around them, until they are framed against the sea. NOW WE PULL BACK, across the forecastle deck. Rising, as we continue back, and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath. Over the bridge wing, along the boat deck until her funnels come INTO FRAME besides us and march past like the pillars of heaven, one by one. We pull back and up, until we are looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on the decks and standing at the rail become antlike. And still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeous aerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty. ISMAY (V.O.) She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history... CUT TO: . INT. PALM COURT RESTAURANT DAY CLOSE ON J. BRUCE ISMAY, Managing Director of White Star Line. ISMAY ...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here, designed her from the keel plates up. He indicates a handsome year old Irish gentlemen to his right, THOMAS ANDREWS, of Harland and Wolf Shipbuilders. WIDER, showing the group assembled for lunch the next day. Ismay seated with Cal, Rose, Ruth, Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews in the Palm Court, a beautiful sunny spot enclosed by high arched windows. ANDREWS (disliking the attention) Well, I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she is... (he slaps the table) ...willed into solid reality. MOLLY Why're ships always bein' called """"she""""? Is it because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage? (they all laugh) Just another example of the men settin' the rules their way. The waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette. RUTH You know I don't like that, Rose. CAL She knows. Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out. CAL (to the waiter) We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce. . (MORE) (CONTINUED) (to Rose, after the waiter moves away) You like lamb, don't you sweetpea? Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth. MOLLY So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal? (turning to Ismay) Hey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce? ISMAY Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability, luxury... and safety ROSE Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay. Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter. RUTH My God, Rose, what's gotten into ROSE Excuse me. She stalks away. RUTH (mortified) I do apologize. MOLLY She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her? CAL (tense but feigning unconcern) Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on. CUT TO: EXT. POOP DECK / AFTER DECKS DAY Jack sits on a bench in the sun. Titanic's wake spreads out behind him to the horizon. . CONTINUED: CAL (cont'd) (CONTINUED) He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather bound sketching pad, his only valuable possession. With conte crayon he draws rapidly, using sure strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL has his year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the rail. She is leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the seagulls. THE SKETCH captures them perfectly, with a great sense of the humanity of the moment. Jack is good. Really good. Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder. He nods appreciatively. TOMMY RYAN, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a crewmember comes by, walking three small dogs around the deck. One of them, a BLACK FRENCH BULLDOG, is among the ugliest creatures on the planet. TOMMY That's typical. First class dogs come down here to take a shit. Jack looks up from his sketch. JACK That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things. TOMMY Like we could forget. Jack glances across the well deck. At the aft railing of B deck promenade stands ROSE, in a long yellow dress and white gloves. CLOSE ON JACK, unable to take his eyes off of her. They are across from each other, about feet apart, with the well deck like a valley between them. She on her promontory, he on his much lower one. She stares down at the water. He watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off. She looks at the frilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the rail. It sails far down to the water and is carried away, astern. A spot of yellow in the vast ocean. He is riveted by her. She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad and isolated. Fabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazin at Rose. Fabrizio and Tommy grin at each other. Rose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack. He is caught staring, but he doesn't look away. She does, but then looks back. Their eyes meet across the space of the well deck, across the gulf between worlds. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm. She jerks her arm away. They argue in pantomime. She storms away, and he goes after her, disappearing along the A deck promenade. Jack stares after her. TOMMY Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get next to the likes o' her. CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON NIGHT SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in heated conversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other side LADY DUFFGORDON is holding forth animatedly. We don't hear what they are saying. Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to the inconsequential babble around her. OLD ROSE (V.O.) I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even noticed. ANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab salad. She pokes the crabfork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder until it draws blood. CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR / B DECK NIGHT Rose walks along the corridor. A steward coming the other way greets her, and she nods with a slight smile. She is perfectly composed. CUT TO: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM NIGHT She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the large vanity mirror. Just stands there, then . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl necklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself, her clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything off the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a handmirror against the vanity, cracking it. CUT TO: EXT. A DECK PROMENADE, AFT NIGHT Rose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying. She is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious! Shaking with emotions she doesn't understand... hatred, selfhatred, desperation. A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional display in public. CUT TO: EXT. POOP DECK NIGHT Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing gloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette. Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck. They are the only two on the stern deck, except for QUARTERMASTER ROWE, twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jack in the shadows, and runs right past him. TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breath hitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against the base of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at the black water. Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress way up, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and gets her heels on the whitepainted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out toward blackness. feet below her, the massive propellers are churning the atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward the horizon. IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Below her are the huge letters of the name """"TITANIC"""". She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into the vortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship's movement. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter and snap of the big Union Jack right above her. JACK Don't do it. She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for her eyes to focus. ROSE Stay back! Don't come any closer! Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern running lights. JACK Take my hand. I'll pull you back in. ROSE No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. JACK No you won't. ROSE What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. JACK You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand. Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance. ROSE You're distracting me. Go away. JACK I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. ROSE Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. He takes off his jacket. JACK I'm a good swimmer. He starts unlacing his left shoe. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE The fall alone would kill you. JACK It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in. ROSE How cold? JACK (taking off his left shoe) Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. He starts unlacing his right shoe. JACK Ever been to Wisconsin? ROSE (perplexed) No. JACK Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice fishing's where you chop a hole in the ROSE I know what ice fishing is! JACK Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. (takes off his other shoe) Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. . CONTINUED: () (MORE) (CONTINUED) I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here. ROSE You're crazy. JACK That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse. JACK Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand. Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe. ROSE Alright. She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He reaches out to take it, firmly. JACK I'm Jack Dawson. ROSE (voice quavering) Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and one foot slips off the edge of the deck. She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand. QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for the ladder. ROSE HELP! HELP!! JACK I've got you. I won't let go. . CONTINUED: () JACK (cont'd) (CONTINUED) Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS again. Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she flails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of her. Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill and sprints across the fantail. ROWE Here, what's all this?! Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and sobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her knees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage man with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and starts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them. ROWE (to Jack) Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch! (to the seamen) Fetch the Master at Arms. CUT TO: EXT. POOP DECK NIGHT A few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS, the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right in front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with Lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more concerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels. CAL What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?! . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) ROSE Cal, stop! It was an accident. CAL An accident?! ROSE It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped. Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact. ROSE I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself. CAL You wanted to see the propellers? GRACIE (shaking his head) Women and machinery do not mix. MASTER AT ARMS (to Jack) Was that the way of it? Rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened. JACK Uh huh. That was pretty much it. He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together. COLONEL GRACIE Well! The boy's a hero then. Good for you son, well done! (to Cal) So it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh? Jack is uncuffed. Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving. CAL (rubbing her arms) Let's get you in. You're freezing. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack. GRACIE (low) Ah... perhaps a little something for the boy? CAL Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it. ROSE Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love? CAL Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do? Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerage ruffian, unwashed and illmannered. CAL I know. (to Jack) Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale? JACK (looking straight at Rose) Sure. Count me in. CAL Good. Settled then. Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close to Gracie as they walk away. CAL This should be amusing. JACK (as Lovejoy passes) Can I bum a cigarette? Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it open. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for later. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette. LOVEJOY You'll want to tie those. (Jack looks at his shoes) . CONTINUED: () (MORE) (CONTINUED) Interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you still had time to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm? Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He turns away to join his group. CUT TO: INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM NIGHT As she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflected in the cracked mirror of her vanity. He comes toward her. CAL (unexpectedly tender) I know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why. From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case. She takes it, numbly. CAL I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thought tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you... Rose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... """"HEART OF THE OCEAN"""" in all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent blue stone glittering with an infinity of scalpellike inner reflections. ROSE My God... Cal. Is it a CAL Daimond. Yes it is. carats. He takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat. He turns her to the mirror, staring behind her. CAL It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the ROSE The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming. . CONTINUED: () LOVEJOY (cont'd) (CONTINUED) He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror. CAL It's for royalty. And we are royalty. His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed by Rose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded. CAL There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if you would deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose. CAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during the following: OLD ROSE (V.O.) Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to illuminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... a heart of ice. Finally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAM, we MORPH SLOWLY to her eyes as the are now... transforming through years of life... TRANSITION INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK Without a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared around her eyes. But the eyes themselves are the same. OLD ROSE After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar. THE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face. ROSE I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it... LOVETT Well, that's the general idea, my dear. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) BODINE So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? (he guffaws) That's great! LOVETT (warningly) Lewis... But Rose laughs with Bodine. BODINE (still laughing) All you had to do was wait two days! Lovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours have passed. This process is taking too long. LOVETT Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that? ROSE Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out. LOVETT Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination? LIZZY That's enough. Lizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail wave goodbye. CUT TO: EXT. LAUNCH AREA/KELDYSH DECK DAY As the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water. Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep. They weave among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) BUELL The partners are pissed. BROCK Bobby, buy me time. I need time. BUELL We're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling you what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to pull. BROCK Well you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby... we're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we just have to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay? Brock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the past part of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away from Buell, toward a quite spot on the deck. BROCK Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second. LIZZY Don't you mean work me? BROCK Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help. LIZZY I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and LIZZY (CONT'D) one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off. BROCK (with undisguised desperation) Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. . CONTINUED: (MORE) (CONTINUED) I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. (he holds out his hand) You see this? Right here? She looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginary shape. LIZZY What? BROCK That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it. LIZZY Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are. LOVETT Maybe she wants to make peace with the past. LIZZY What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago. LOVETT Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time. LIZZY (looks at him hard) You think she was really there? LOVETT Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there. CUT TO: INT. IMAGING SHACK Bodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE LIVE FEED FROM THE WRECKSNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of the hull, heading aft. The rectangular windows of A deck (forward) march past on the right. . CONTINUED: () BROCK (cont'd) (CONTINUED) ROSE The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. B DECK TITANIC DAY MATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in , passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the sunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose. OLD ROSE (V.O.) As if I hadn't felt the sun in years. IT IS SATURDAY APRIL , . Rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare at her. CUT TO: INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM The social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers with babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages and being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it. Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat under the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general havoc. Jack is playing with year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces together in his sketchbook. Fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive Norwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across the room. FABRIZIO No Italian? Some little English? HELGA No, no. Norwegian. Only. Helga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... and Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see... . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Rose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls. Rose feels suddenly selfconscious as the steerage passengers stare openly at this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and gives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her, smiling. ROSE Hello Jack. Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella. JACK Hello again. ROSE Could I speak to you in private? JACK Uh, yes. Of course. After you. He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK DAY Jack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading and talking in steamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. He feels out of place in his rough clothes. They are both awkward, for different reasons. JACK So, you got a name by the way? ROSE Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. JACK That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down. There is an awkward pause. ROSE Mr. Dawson, I JACK Jack. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you. JACK Well, here you are. ROSE Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. JACK You're welcome. Rose. ROSE Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? JACK That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out. ROSE I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. (in a rush) I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! JACK Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead. ROSE (she lowers her head) Oh God, I am such an utter fool. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK That penguin last night, is he one of them? ROSE Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. JACK Is he your boyfriend? ROSE Worse I'm afraid. She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond. JACK Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom. They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a first class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away. JACK So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. ROSE Yes, exactly! JACK So don't marry him. ROSE If only it were that simple. JACK It is that simple. ROSE Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. JACK Well, I guess I will tonight. Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook. ROSE What's this? . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) JACK Just some sketches. ROSE May I? The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. She sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... each one an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping man, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive. His book is a celebration of the human condition. ROSE Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are. JACK Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scrambles after them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail. ROSE Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! JACK Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish. JACK I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway. For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off. ROSE (laughing) You're deranged! She goes back to the book, turning a page. ROSE Well, well... . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands and eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form... almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as some strollers go by. ROSE (trying to be very adult) And these were drawn from life? JACK Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off. She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight, half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a flower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print of Georgia O'Keefe. ROSE You liked this woman. You used her several times. JACK She had beautiful hands. ROSE (smiling) I think you must have had a love affair with her... JACK (laughing) No, no! Just with her hands. ROSE (looking up from the drawings) You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. JACK I see you. There it is. That piercing gaze again. ROSE And...? . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) JACK You wouldn'ta jumped. CUT TO: INT. RECEPTION ROOM / DDECK DAY Ruth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYEREDWARDES, the COUNTESS OF ROTHES, a ish English blueblood with patirician features. Ruth sees someone coming across the room and lowers her voice. RUTH Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly before she sits with us. Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising. MOLLY Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea. RUTH We're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to take the air on the boat deck. MOLLY That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip. Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table. ISMAY So you've not lit the last four boilers then? SMITH No, but we're making excellent time. ISMAY (impatiently) Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines! . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) SMITH I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in. ISMAY Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. (Ismay slaps his hand on the table) Retire with a bang, eh, E.J? A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy. CUT TO: EXT. A DECK PROMENADE DAY Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting lateafternoon light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa. ROSE (girlish and excited) You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! JACK (laughing) You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar. ROSE (angry in a flash) Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. JACK I'm sorry. Really... I am. ROSE Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees something ahead and her face lights up. ROSE ...or a moving picture actress! She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail. MARVIN You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You may never see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling. SUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the rail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into the picture and makes him pose. Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, with music and no dialogue. SERIES OF CUTS: Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead. Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming fanning him like slave girls. Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing, turns her head in bored disdain. Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shootout. Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely Whiplash. CUT TO: EXT. A DECK PROMENADE / AFT SUNSET Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the Adeck rail aft, shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on. It is a magical moment... perfect. ROSE So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece. ROSE A whole ten cents?! JACK (not getting it) Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing. ROSE (looks at the dusk sky) Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. (turning to him) Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it. JACK Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that sidesaddle stuff. ROSE You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me? JACK Sure. If you like. ROSE (smiling at him) I think I would. (she looks at the horizon) And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely. He spits. It arcs out over the water. JACK Your turn. Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittle which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water. JACK Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!... then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing? She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it (ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Two comets of gob fly out over the water. JACK That was great! Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees her expression and turns. RUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching them hawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed. ROSE Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson. RUTH Charmed, I'm sure. Jack has a little spit running down his chin. He doesn't know it. Molly Brown is grinning. As Rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear... OLD ROSE (V.O.) The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be squashed quickly. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) MOLLY Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot They all jump as a BUGLER sounds the meal call right behind them. MOLLY Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge? ROSE Shall we go dress, mother? (over her shoulder) See you at dinner, Jack. RUTH (as they walk away) Rose, look at you... out in the sun with no hat. Honestly! The Countess exits with Ruth and Rose, leaving Jack and Molly alone on deck. MOLLY Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing? JACK Not really. MOLLY Well, you're about to go into the snakepit. I hope you're ready. What are you planning to wear? Jack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her. He hadn't thought about that. MOLLY I figured. CUT TO: INT. MOLLY BROWN'S STATEROOM Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place. Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and Molly is tying his bow tie. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) MOLLY Don't feel bad about it. My husband still can't tie one of these damn things after years. There you go. She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack goes into the bathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed. MOLLY I gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he's been eating while I'm away. She turns and sees him, though we don't. MOLLY My, my, my... you shine up like a new penny. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK / FIRST CLAsS ENTRANCE DUSK A purple sky, shot with orange, in the west. Drifting strains of classic music. We TRACK WITH JACK along the deck. By Edwardian standards he looks badass. Dashing in his borrowed whitetie outfit, right down to his pearl studs. A steward bows and smartly opens the door to the First Class Entrance. STEWARD Good evening, sir. Jack plays the role smoothly. Nods with just the right degree of disdain. CUT TO: INT. UPPER LANDING / GRAND STAIRCASE AND ADECK Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out before him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelier at its center. Sweeping down six stories is the First Class Grand Staircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time. And the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaborate hairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen in evening dress, standing with one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack descends to A deck. Several men nod a perfunctory greeting. He nods back, keeping it simple. He feels like a spy. Cal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry. They both walk right past Jack, neither one gecognizeing him. Cal nods at him, one gent to another. But Jack barely has time to be amused. Because just behind Cal and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, her lowcut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in white gloves that come well above above the elbow. Jack is hypnotized by her beauty. CLOSE ON ROSE as she approaches Jack. He imitates the gentlemen's stance, hand behind his back. She extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissing the back of her fingers. Rose flushes, beaming noticeably. She can't take her eyes off him. JACK I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it. ROSE Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson. CAL (caught off guard) Dawson! I didn't recognize you. (studies him) Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen. CUT TO: INT. DDECK RECEPTION ROOM CUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty broadshouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going into the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low: MOLLY Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack? JACK Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) MOLLY Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club. As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out several notables. ROSE There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. (nodding toward a couple) And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady DuffGordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff Gordon and Colonel Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably. ROSE And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course. Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are looking at Rose like a prize show horse. SIR COSMO Hockley, she is splendid. CAL Thank you. GRACIE Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck. Ruth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhat coquettishly. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) RUTH How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch. The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the Astor's going through the ornate double doors. ROSE J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. ASTOR (shaking his hand) Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons? JACK No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose: MADELEINE It's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it? CUT TO: INT. DINING SALOON Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from BANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear... OLD ROSE (V.O.) He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted upon... CUT TO: INT. DINING SALOON . CONTINUED: () CLOSE ON RUTH. RUTH Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good on this ship. WIDER: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and Thomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie, the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors. JACK The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats. Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate. CAL Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night. (to Jack, as if to a child) This is foie gras. It's goose liver. We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous. GUGGENHEIM (low to Madame Aubert) What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here? WAITER (to Jack) How do you take your caviar, sir? CAL (answering for him) Just a soupcon of lemon... (to Jack, smiling) ...it improves the flavor with champagne. JACK (to the waiter) No caviar for me, thanks. (to Cal) Never did like it much. . (CONTINUED) He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles. RUTH And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? JACK Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks. RUTH You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you? JACK Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count. Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute. MOLLY Well said, Jack. COLONEL GRACIE (raising his glass) Here, here. Rose raises her glass, looking at Jack. ROSE To making it count. Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further. RUTH How is it you have the means to travel, Mr. Dawson? . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker. (he glances at Rose) A very lucky hand. GRACIE All life is a game of luck. CAL A real man makes his own luck, Archie. Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his notebook, completely ignoring the conversation. ROSE Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this little book. (grabs it and reads) Increase number of screws in hat hooks from to . You build the biggest ship in the world and this preoccupies you?! Andrews smiles sheepishly. ISMAY He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas? ANDREWS All three million of them. ISMAY His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in the eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews. ROSE Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly. ANDREWS Thankyou, Rose. We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) TIME TRANSITION: Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends and lighting. ROSE (low, to Jack) Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room. GRACIE (rising) Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen? ROSE (low) Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being masters of the universe. GRACIE Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you? Actually he does, but... JACK No thanks. I'm heading back. CAL Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come. Cal and te other gentlemen exit. ROSE Jack, must you go? JACK Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin. He leans over to take her hand. INSERT: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm. Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rose surreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: """"Make it count. Meet me at the clock"""". CUT TO: . CONTINUED: () INT. ADECK FOYERNIGHT Rose crosses the ADeck foyer, sighting Jack at the landing above. Overhead is the crystal dome. Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clock with its carved figures of Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour. MOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him. He turns, sees her... smiles. JACK Want to go to a real party? CUT TO: INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM Crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hoc band is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music on fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing, drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling. Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack meanwhile dances with year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet. As the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl. ROSE May I cut in, miss? JACK You're still my best girl, Cora. Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as he takes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of her back. It is an electrifying moment. ROSE I don't know the steps. JACK Just move with me. Don't think. The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts to get into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the steops. ROSE Wait... stop! . (CONTINUED) She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to Tommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing faster as the music speeds up. CUT TO: OMITTED INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM The scene is rowdy and rollicking. A table gets knocked over as a drunk crashes into it. And in the middle of it... Rose dancing with Jack in her stocking feet. The steps are fast and she shines with sweat. A space opens around them, and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and faster. FABRIZIO AND HELGA. Dancing has obviated the need for a common language. He whirls her, then she responds by whirling him... Fabrizio's eyes go wide when he realizes she's stronger than he is. The tune ends in a mad rush. Jack steps away from Rose with a flourish, allowing her to take a bow. Exhilarated and slightly tipsy, she does a graceful ballet ployer, feet turned out perfectly. Everyone laughs and applauds. Rose is a hit with the steerage folks, who've never had a lady party with them. They move to a table, flushed and sweaty. Rose grabs Fabrizio's cigarette and takes a big drag. She's feeling cocky. Fabrizio is grinning, holding hands with Helga. JACK How you two doin'? FABRIZIO I don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine. Tommy walks up with a pint for each of them. Rose chugs hers, showing off. ROSE You think a first class girl can't drink? Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy, who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommy lunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) TOMMY You stupid bastard!! Bjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps into the middle of it, pushing them apart. JACK Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse? Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grins and claps Bjorn on the shoulder. ROSE So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape at her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws up in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around. ROSE Oooowww! I haven't done that in years. Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up. THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through the gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing. LOVEJOY closes the door. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK NIGHT The stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way. Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party, they are singing a popular song """"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine"""". JACK/ROSE Come Josephine in my flying machine And it's up she goes! Up she goes! In the air she goes. Where? There she goes! . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end. Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos. ROSE Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless. She goes to the rail and leans on it. ROSE They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst. He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is the slightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their hands are touching. JACK You're not one of them. There's been a mistake. ROSE A mistake? JACK Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address. ROSE (laughing) I did, didn't I? ROSE (CONT'D) (pointing suddenly) Look! A shooting star. JACK That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. ROSE I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems to be thinking the same thing. JACK What would you wish for? After a beat, Rose pulls back. ROSE Something I can't have. (she smiles sadly) Goodnight, Jack. And thank you. She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance. JACK Rose!! But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world. CUT TO: INT. ORSE AND CAL'S SUITE / PRIVATE PROMENADE DAY SUNDAY APRIL , . A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes inside. CAL I had hoped you would come to me last night. ROSE I was tired. CAL Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting. ROSE (stiffening) I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. CAL You will never behave like that again! Do you understand? . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) ROSE I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms. CAL Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear? Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens up. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom. ROSE We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy. CUT TO: INT. RUTH'S SUITE DAY Rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her corset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all. RUTH You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it! Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the corset strings with both hands. ROSE Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed. Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK! RUTH (wheeling on her) Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone! . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day! RUTH Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play. Rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. Ruth sucks in her waist and Rose pulls. RUTH I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival. ROSE (hurt and lost) How can you put this on my shoulders? Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees the naked fear in her mother's eyes. RUTH Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish? ROSE It's so unfair. RUTH Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy. Rose pulls the corset tighter. CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON At the divine service, Captain Smith is leading a group in the hymn """"Almighty Father Strong To Save."""" Rose and Ruth sing in the middle of the group. Lovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on Rose. He notices a commotion at the entry doors. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack has been halted there by two stewards. He is dressed in his third class clothes, and stands there, hat in hand, looking out of place. STEWARD Look, you, you're not supposed to be in here. JACK I was just here last night... don't you remember? (seeing Lovejoy coming toward him) He'll tell you. LOVEJOY Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of your assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude He holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to take. JACK I don't want money, I LOVEJOY and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate. Jack spots Rose but she doesn't see him. JACK I just need to talk to Rose for a LOVEJOY Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs. (giving the twenties to the stewards) And that he stays there. STEWARD Yes sir! (to Jack) Come along you. END ON ROSE, not seeing Jack hustled out. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE (singing) O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea. CUT TO: INT. GYMNASIUM DAY An Edwardian nautilus room. There are machines we recognize, and some don't. A woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking rediculous. Thomas Andrews is leading a small tour group, including Rose, Ruth and Cal. Cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a well trained stroke. CAL Reminds me of my Harvard days. T.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his presentday counterpart on an """"Abflex"""" infomercial. He hits a switch and a machine with a saddle on it starts to undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious. MCCAULEY The electric horse is very popular. We even have an electric camel. (to Ruth) Care to try your hand at the rowing, m'am? RUTH Don't be absurd. I can't think of a skill I should likely need less. ANDREWS The next stop on our tour will be bridge. This way, please. CUT TO: EXT. AFT WELL DECK, BDECK AND ADECK DAY Jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by Tommy and Fabrizio. He quickly climbs the steps to BDeck and steps over the gate separating rd from nd class. TOMMY She's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'. But she's in another world, Jackie, forget her. She's closed the door. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) Jack moves furtively to the wall below the ADeck promenade, aft. JACK It was them, not her. (glancing around the deck) Ready... go. Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouching down. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck, where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck. TOMMY He's not bein' logical, I tell ya. FABRIZIO Amore is'a not logical. CUT TO: EXT. ADECK / AFT DAY A man is playing with his son, who is spinning a top with a string. The man's overcoat and hat are sitting on a deck chair nearby. Jack emerges from behind one of the huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat and bowler hat. He walks away, slipping into the coat, and slicks his hair back with spit. Then puts the hat on at a jaunty angle. At a distance he could pass for a gentlemen. CUT TO: INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM DAY HAROLD BRIDE, the year old Junior Wireless Operator, hustles in and skirts around Andrews' tour group to hand a Marconigram to Captain Smith. BRIDE Another ice warning, sir. This one from the """"Baltic"""". SMITH Thankyou, Sparks. Smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket. He nods reassuringly to Rose and the group. SMITH Not to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year. . CONTINUED: (MORE) (CONTINUED) In fact, we're speeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit. Andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door. They exit just as SECOND OFFICER CHARLES HERBERT LIGHTOLLER comes out of the chartroom, stopping next to First Officer Murdoch. LIGHTOLLER Did we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts? FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH Haven't seen them since Southampton. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE DAY Andrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck. ROSE Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. ANDREWS About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here. (he gestures along the eck) But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was overruled. CAL (slapping the side of a boat) Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship! ANDREWS Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true. She's all the lifeboat you need. As they are passing Boat , a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up behind the group. It is Jack. . CONTINUED: SMITH (cont'd) (CONTINUED) He taps Rose on the arm and she turns, gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which Jack holds open. They duck into the CUT TO: INT. GYMNASIUM DAY Jack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the rippleglass window to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the woman who was riding the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room. ROSE Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you. He takes her by the shoulders. JACK Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and ROSE Jack, I JACK No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not like anyone she has ever known. ROSE You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. JACK I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE It's not up to you to save me, Jack. JACK You're right. Only you can do that. ROSE I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNG DAY The most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style. Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth, the Countess Rothes and Lady DuffGordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her. RUTH Of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been... TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on. REVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four year old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. The mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. The little girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpse of Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to becoming an Edwardian geisha. ON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea all over her dress. ROSE Oh, look what I've done. CUT TO: EXT. TITANIC DAY TITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a giant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jack is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack hears her voice, behind him... ROSE Hello, Jack. He turns and she is standing there. ROSE I changed my mind. He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face. ROSE Fabrizio said you might be up JACK Sssshh. Come here. He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her. JACK Close your eyes. She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his hands, her arms stay up... like wings. JACK Okay. Open them. Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky. There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water feel below. ROSE I'm flying! She leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist to steady her. JACK (singing softly) Come Josephine in my flying machine... . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against his chest. He pushes forward slightly against her. Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers... fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly, their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers. Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear. Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion. Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into a night without fear. IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEET nudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow. FLEET Wish I had those bleedin' binoculars. JACK AND ROSE, embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leaving the ruined bow of the WRECK CUT TO: INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK OLD ROSE blinks, seeming to come back to the present.

There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand... (remembering Rose) ... excuse me... in his hand, and he's ordering more speed. BROCK years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough to sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too big, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything he knows is wrong. ROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the artnouveau comb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her hands, turning it slowly. She is watching a monitor, which shows the ruins of Suite B/. PUSH IN until the image fills frame. TRANSITION: INT. ROSE'S SUITE ... . Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the room. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table. ROSE Will this light do? Don't artists need good light? JACK (bad French accent) Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. (seeing the paintings) Hey... Monet! He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny. She goes into the adjoining walkin wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the safe and start working the combination. He's fascinated. ROSE Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere. JACK Should I be expecting him anytime soon? ROSE Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror behind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out to Jack who takes it nervously. JACK What is it? A sapphire? ROSE A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension. ROSE I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this. (she smiles at him) Wearing only this. He looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO: ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair. She shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders. IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools. His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room, wearing a silk kimono. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll. As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want. She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stone lies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the robe. Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor (this is all in cuts, lyrical). ROSE Tell me when it looks right to you. She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we remember from the drawing... almost. JACK Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to me. That's it. Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh. ROSE I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. JACK (sweating) He does landscapes. TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his sketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is an image she will carry the rest of her life. Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges is the best thing he has ever done. Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful, and her eyes radiate her energy.

ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE NIGHT BACK TO . Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again, is leaning on his shoulder, watching. OLD ROSE (V.O.) Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine. Rose gazes at the drawing. He has Xrayed her soul. ROSE Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night. He does: //. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanic stationary. We don't see what it says. She accepts the drawing from him, and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe. She puts the diamond back in the safe, placing hte drawing and the note on top of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK! CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM NIGHT Lovejoy enters from the Palm Court through the revolving door and crosses the room toward Hockley. .

LOVEJOY None of the stewards have seen her. CAL (low but forceful) This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her. CUT TO: EXT. ATLANTIC NIGHT TITANIC glides across an unnatural sea, blakc and calm as a pool of oil. The ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly in the black water. The sky is brilliant with stars. A meteor traces a bright line across the heavens. ON THE BRIDGE, Captain Smith peers out at the blackness ahead of the ship. QUARTERMASTER HITCHINS brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon. It steams in the bitter cold of the open bridge. Second Officer Lightoller is next to him, staring out at the sheet of black glass the Atlantic has become. LIGHTOLLER I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in years at sea. SMITH Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. LIGHTOLLER It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base. SMITH Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. LIGHTOLLER Yes sir. SMITH And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door. LOVEJOY Miss Rose? Hello? He hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward hers. CUT TO: INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE Rose and Jack come out of her stateroom, closing the door. She leads him quickly along the corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway across the open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy comes out. The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them. ROSE Come on! She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemen about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They run into one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR. ROSE Take us down. Quickly, quickly! The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate. Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the bars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs as Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her. CUT TO: INT. EDECK FOYER / ELEVATORS Lovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one Jack and Rose were in. The Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runs around the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He tries the stairs going down to FDeck. CUT TO: . INT. FDECK CORRIDORS / FAN ROOM A functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces (fan rooms, boiler uptakes). Jack and Rose are leaning against a wall, laughing. JACK Pretty tough for a valet, this fella. ROSE He's an exPinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... JACK Kinda like we're doin' right now uh oh! Lovejoy has spotted them from a crosscorridor nearby. He charges toward them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one door, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open. They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down. Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder. JACK After you, m'lady. CUT TO: INT. BOILER ROOM FIVE AND SIX Jack and Rose come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement. It is like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black figures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room, dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal. JACK (shouting over the din) Carry on! Don't mind us! They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in the dark, out of sight of the working crew. . (CONTINUED) Watching from the shadows, they see the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the insatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar of the fires. CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Amid unparalled luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping brandy. COLONEL GRACIE We're going like hell I tel you. I have fifty dollars that says we make it into New York Tuesday night! Cal looks at his gold pocket watch, and scowls, not listening. CUT TO: OMITTED INT. BOILER ROOM SIX The furnaces roar, silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack kisses Rose's face, tasting the sweat trickling down from her forehead. They kiss passionately in the steamy, pounding darkness. CUT TO: INT. HOLD # Jack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. She hugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room. They come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing down to a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color. Rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal. There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a rose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather and wood. JACK Where to, Miss? ROSE To the stars. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat into the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quiet darkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth. JACK Are you nervous? ROSE Au contraire, mon cher. He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers. ROSE Put your hands on me Jack. He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight. CUT TO: INT. WIRELESS ROOM A BRILLIANT ARC OF ELECTRICITY fills frame the sparks gap of the Marconi instrument as SENIOR WIRELESS OPERATOR JACK PHILLIPS () rapidly keys out a message. Junior Operator Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing messages swamping them. BRIDE Look at this one, he wants his private train to meet him. La dee da. (slaps them down) We'll be up all bloody night on this lot. Phillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby ship, the Leyland frieghter CALIFORNIAN, which jams his outgoing signal.

HOLD # PUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is completely fogged up. Rose's hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment, making a handprint in the veil of condensation. INSIDE THE CAR, Jack's overcoat is liek a blanket over them. It stirs and Rose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, still mostly clothed. Their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly. She puts her hand on his face, as if making sure he is real. ROSE You're trembling. JACK It's okay. I'm alright. . (CONTINUED) He lays his cheek against her chest. JACK I can feel your heart beating. She hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear life. OLD ROSE (V.O.) Well, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a car, and certainly not the last, by several million.

ATLANTIC / TITANIC NIGHT The bow sweeps under us, and the CAMERA CLIMBS toward the foremast and the tiny halfcylinder of the crow's nest, which grows as we push in on lookouts Fleet and Lee. They are stamping their feet and swinging their arms, trying to keep warm in the knot freezing wind, which whips capor of their breath away behind. FLEET You can smell ice, you know, when it's near. LEE Bollocks. FLEET Well I can. CUT TO: INT. BOILER ROOM SIX Without hearing hte words over the roar of the furnaces, we see stokers telling TWO STEWARDS which way Rose and Jack went. The stewards move off toward the forward holds. CUT TO: INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE Cal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his face clenches with fury. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) He reads the not again: """"DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US BOTH LOCKED IN YOUR SAFE, ROSE"""". Lovejoy, standing behind him, looks over his shoulder at the drawing. Cal crumples Rose's not, then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip it in half. He tenses to do it, then stops himself. CAL I have a better idea. CUT TO: INT. HOLD # NIGHT The two stewards enter. They have electric torches and play the beams around the hold. They spot the Renault with its fogged up rear window and approach it slowly.

FORWARD WELL DECK AND CROW'S NEST NIGHT Rose and Jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck. They can barely stand, they are laughing so hard. UP ABOVE THEM, IN THE CROW'S NEST, lookout Fleet hears the disturbance below and looks around and back down to the well deck, where he can see two figures embracing. Jack and Rose stand in each others arms. Their breath clouds around them in the now freezing air, but they don't even feel the cold. ROSE When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. JACK This is crazy. ROSE I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely. IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet nudges Lee. FLEET Cor... look at that, would ya. LEE They're a bloody sight warmer than we are. FLEET Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same. They both have a good laugh at that one. It is Fleet whose expression falls first. Glancing forward again, he does a double take. The color drains out of his face. FLEET'S POV: a massive iceberg right in their path, yards out. FLEET Bugger me!! Fleet reaches past Lee and rings the lookout bell three times, then grabs the telephone, calling the bridge. He waits precious seconds for it to be picket up, never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead. FLEET Pick up, ya bastard. CUT TO: INT. / EXT.

While signaling """"FULL SPEED ASTERN"""" he yells to Quartermaster Hitchins, who is at the wheel. MURDOCH Hard a' starboard. MOODY (standing behind Hitchins) Hard'a starboard. The helm is hard over, sir. CRASH SEQUENCE / SERIES OF CUTS: CHIEF ENGINEER BELL is just checking the soup he has warming on a steam manifold when the engine telegraph clangs, then goes... incredibly... to FULL SPEED ASTERN. He and the other ENGINEERS just stare at it a second, unbelieving. Then Bell reacts. BELL Full astern! FULL ASTERN!! The engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves and start braking the mighty propeller shafts, big as Sequias, to a stop. IN BOILER ROOM SIX, Leading Stoker FREDERICK BARRETT is standing with nd Engineer JAMES HESKETH when the red warning light and """"STOP"""" indicator come on. BARRETT Shut all dampers! Shut 'em!! FROM THE BRIDGE Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. The bow finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse of the helm setting). MURDOCH'S jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness. He holds his breath as the horrible physics play out. IN THE CROW'S NEST Frederick Fleet braces himself. THE BOW OF THE SHIP thunders right at CAMERA and KRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The iceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as the steel plate of the hull flexes under the load. IN # HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet with a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside the ship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping them off their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the men scramble for the stairs. ON GDECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice. IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING THUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle in toward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming in about two feet above the floor. ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in astonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain. Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jump back to avoid flying chunks of ice. ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throws the switch that closes them. MURDOCH Hard a 'port! Judging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the stern. BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the swirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms and . The room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces. Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down like a slow guillotine. BARRETT Go Lads! Go! Go! He dives through into Boiler Room just before the door rumbles down with a CLANG. JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving aft down the side of the ship. .

He feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in his face. Too much of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortal wound. IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Gracie watches his highball vibrating on the table. IN THE PALM COURT, with its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds up her drink to a passing waiter. MOLLY Hey, can I get some ice here, please? Silently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't see it. It disappears astern. OMITTED IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet turns to his Lee... FLEET Oy, mate... that was a close shave. LEE Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ! CUT TO: INT. / EXT. BRIDGE CLOSE ON MURDOCH. The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to reflect his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on what just happened. He just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its maiden voyage. MURDOCH (stiffly, to Moody) Note the time. Enter it in the log. Captain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking in his shirt. SMITH What was that, Mr. Murdoch? . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) MURDOCH An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and I SMITH Close the emergency doors. MURDOCH The doors are closed.

SMITH Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship. CUT TO: INT. GDECK FORWARD In steerage, Fabrizio comes out into the hall to see what's going on. He sees dozens of rats running toward him in the corridor, fleeing the flooding bow. Fabrizio jumps aside as the rats run by. FABRIZIO Ma che cazzo! IN HIS STATEROOM Tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and drops down to the floor. SPLASH!! TOMMMY Cor!! What in hell?! He naps on the light. The floor is covered with inches of freezing water, and more coming in. He pulls the door open, and steps out into the corridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio is running toward him, yelling something in Italian. Tommy and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, getting everybody up and out. The alarm spreads in several languages. CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR / ADECK A couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers. A STeWARD hurries along, reassuring them. .

May I bring you anything? THOMAS ANDREWS brushes past them, walking fast and carrying an armload of rolled up ship's plans. CUT TO: EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose are leaning over the starboard rail, looking at the hull of the ship. JACK Looks okay. I don't see anything. ROSE Could it have damaged the ship? JACK It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay. Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck, laughing. CUT TO: INT. STEERAGE FORWARD Fabrizio and Tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors, heading aft away from the flooding. Many of them have grabbed suitcases and duffel bags, some of which are soaked. TOMMY If this is the direction the rats were runnin', it's good enough for me. CUT TO: INT.

Rose and Jack come up the steps from the well deck, which are right next to the three men. They stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate. A moment later Captain Smith rounds the corner, followed by Andrews and Carpenter Hutchinson. They have come down from the bridge by the outside stairs. The three men, their faces grim, crush right past Jack and Rose. Andrews barely glances at her. SMITH Can you shore up? HUTCHINSON Not unless the pumps get ahead. The inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK (low, to her) It's bad. ROSE We have to tell Mother and Cal. JACK Now it's worse. ROSE Come with me, Jack.

ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and two stewards (Steward # and Barnes). Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack. ROSE Something serious has happened. CAL That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...

MASTER AT ARMS Coat off, mate. Lovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging out of it. The Master at Arms pats him down. JACK This is horseshit. ROSE Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack's coat. STEWARD BARNES Is this it? Rose is stunned. Needless to say, so is Jack. CAL That's it. MASTER AT ARMS Right then. Now don't make a fuss. He starts to handcuff Jack. JACK Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't! ROSE (uncertain) He couldn't have. CAL Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the combination when you opend the safe. FLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyes as he stands behind her, watching. ROSE But I was with him the whole time. .

There is a label inside the collar with the owner's name. MASTER AT ARMS That was reported stolen today. JACK I was going to return it! Rose Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him. He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out into the hall. She can't look him in the eye. JACK Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know it! She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te tears well up. RUTH Why do women believe men? CUT TO: INT. MAIL SORTING ROOM / HOLD Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below. Andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full. Sacks of mail float everywhere.

It is a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands are shaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain. ISMAY When can we get underway, do you think? Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. The builder points to it for emphasis as he talks. ANDREWS Water feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six. SMITH That's right. ANDREWS Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.

Smith turns to his employer. SMITH I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK Andrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry to uncover the boats. Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and the din is horrendous. Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of disorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one of the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam. ANDREWS Turn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you never had a boat drill? SEAMAN No sir! Not with these new davits, sir. He looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and the tackle for the """"falls""""... .

ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE From inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor. RUTH I had better go dress. Ruth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly for a moment, then SLAPS her across the face. CAL It is a little slut, isn't it? To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly. CAL Look at me, you little There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens and their steward puts his head in. STEWARD BARNES Sir, I've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up to the boat deck. CAL Get out. We're busy. The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a dresser. STEWARD I'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders. Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight. (he hands a lifebelt to Rose) Not to worry, miss, I'm sure it's just a precaution. CAL This is ridiculous. .

STEERAGE BERTHING AFT BLACKNESS. Then BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by a steward. The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep. STEWARD # Everybody up. Let's go. Put your lifebelts on. IN THE CORRIDOR outside, another steward is going from door to door along the hall, pouncing and yelling. STEWARD # Lifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody up, come on. Lifebelts on... People come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed. In the foreground a SYRIAN WOMAN asks her husband what was said. He shrugs. CUT TO: INT. WIRELESS ROOM ON PHILLIPS, looking shocked. PHILLIPS CQD, sir? SMITH That's right. The distress call. CQD. Tell whoever responds that we are going down by the head and need immediate assistance. Smith hurries out. PHILLIPS Blimey. BRIDE Maybe you ought to try that new distress call... S.O.S. (grinning) It may be our only chance to use it. .

BOAT DECK Thomas Andrews looks around in amazement. The deck is empty except for the crew fumbling with the davits. He yells over the roar of the steam to First Officer Murdoch. ANDREWS Where are all the passengers? MURDOCH They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them. Andrews feels like he is in a bad dream. He looks at his pocketwatch and heads for the foyer entrance. CUT TO: INT. ADECK FOYER A large number of First Class passengers have gathered near the staircase. They are getting indignant about the confusion. Molly Brown snags a passing YOUNG STEWARD. MOLLY What's doing, sonny? You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling our heels. The young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the stairs. YOUNG STEWARD Sorry, mum. Let me go and find out. The jumpy piano rhythm of """"Alexander's Ragtime Band"""" comes out of the first class lounge a few yards away. Band leader WALLACE HARTLEY has assembled some of his men on Captain's orders, to allay panic. Hockley's entourage comes up to the Adeck foyer. Cal is carrying the lifebelts, almost as an afterthought. Rose is like a sleepwalker. CAL It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) RUTH There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley. (to Trudy) Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back. Thomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, which he knows is doomed. Rose, standing nearby, sees his heartbroken expression. She walks over to him and Cal goes after her. ROSE I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. ANDREWS The ship will sink. ROSE You're certain? ANDREWS Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. CAL My God. Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking? ANDREWS Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? ROSE Yes, I understand.

SMITH And she's the only one who's responding? BRIDE The only one close, sir. She says they can be here in four hours. SMITH Four hours! The enormity of it hits Smith like a sledgehammer blow. SMITH Thank you, Bride. He turns as Bride exits, and looks out onto the blackness. SMITH (to himself) My God. CUT TO: . EXT. BOAT DECK NIGHT Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first class woman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even small dogs. Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him. He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the steam... LIGHTOLLER Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir? Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightoller sees the awesome truth in Smith's face. LIGHTOLLER (to the men) Right! Start the loading. Women and children! The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes. ON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play. HARTLEY Number . Ready and The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side, near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike up a waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship. LIGHTOLLER Ladies, please. Step into the boat. Finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the drop to the water far below. WOMAN IN CROWD You watch. They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and we'll all be back on board by breakfast. . (CONTINUED) Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band. RUTH My brooch, I left my brooch. I must have it! She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to let her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her. CAL Stay here, Ruth. Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time. CUT TO: INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT / CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. Some have lifebelts on, others don't. STEWARD # (to Steward #) I told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw, bloody hell! He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and bags, completely blocking the corridor. Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. They rech a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio spots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with suitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him. Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is a steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen on the other side. STEWARD Stay calm, please. It's not time to go up to the boats yet. Near Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small children and their battered luggage. LITTLE BOY What are we doing, mummy? . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) WOMAN We're just waiting, dear.

INSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next to the porthole. Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a . bullet on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks up the bullet. LOVEJOY You know... I believe this ship may sink. (crosses to Jack) I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation... He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. LOVEJOY Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. .

BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE, FORWARD At the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the sky and EXPLODES with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall. WHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director of White Star Line is cracking. Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the rocket panics him. He starts shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of BOAT . ISMAY There is no time to waste! (yelling and waving his arms) Lower away! Lower away! Lower away! FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a babyfaced , and the youngest officer, looks up from the tangled falls at the madman. LOWE Get out of the way, you fool! ISMAY Do you know who I am? Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay. LOWE You're a passenger. And I'm a ship's bloody officer. Now do what you're told! LOWE (CONT'D) (turning away) Steady men!

DANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping to get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has Mary posed in front of the scene at the boats. MARVIN You're afraid, darling. Scared to death. That's it! Either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified. ROSE watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they step closer to the boat. Husbands saying goodbye to wives and children. Lovers and friends parted. Nearby MOLLY is getting a reluctant woman to board the boat. MOLLY Come on, you heard the man. Get in the boat, sister. RUTH Will the lifeboats be seated according to class? I hope they're not too crowded ROSE Oh, Mother shut up! (Ruth freezes, mouth open) Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die. CAL Not the better half. PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. Jack is third class. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket bursts overhead, bathing her face in white light. ROSE You unimaginable bastard. . (CONTINUED) MOLLY Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These are the first class seats right up here. That's it. Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks around for some other women who might need a push. MOLLY Come on, Rose. You're next, darlin'. Rose steps back, shaking her head. RUTH Rose, get in the boat! ROSE Goodbye, mother. Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal grabs Rose's arm but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. Cal catches up to Rose and grabs her again, roughly. CAL Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat? ROSE I'd rather be his whore than your wife. He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back toward the lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets go with a curse and she runs into the crowd. LIGHTOLLER Lower away!! RUTH Rose! ROSE!! MOLLY Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. She'll be along. The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out. .

ROSE That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd! Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose runs on as the two men grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance. Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs into a knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them... CUT TO: INT.

Quartermaster Hitchins, at the tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately his two seamen can't row. They flail like a duck with a broken wing. HITCHINS Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull. MOLLY Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.

She claws the door open and splashes out, hiking up her floorlength skirt so she can move. The lift goes back up, behind her, as she looks around. ROSE Left, crew passage. She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place is understandably deserted. She is on her own. ROSE Right, right... right. She turns into a crosscorridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors on each side. ROSE Jack? Jaaacckk?? CUT TO: INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR Jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red. He collapses back on the bench. realizing he's screwed. Then he hears her through the door. JACK ROSE!! In here! IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back, locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave. She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him. ROSE Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing. JACK That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. ROSE I know, I know. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk. JACK So... how did you find out I didn't do it? ROSE I didn't. (she looks at him) I just realized I already knew. They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searching drawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out. A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below. CUT TO: EXT. TITANIC / BOAT ONE While the seamen detach the falls, Boat One rocks next to the hull. Lucile and Sir Cosmo DuffGordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four times that many. LUCILE I despise small boats. I just know I'm going to be seasick. I always get seasick in small boats. Good Heavens, there's a man down there. In a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking up at her... a face in a bubble of light under the water. CUT TO: INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE Rose stops trashing the room, and stands there, breathing hard. ROSE There's no key in here. They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulled his feet up onto the bench. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK You have to go for help. ROSE (nodding) I'll be right back. JACK I'll wait here. She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashes away. Jack looks down at the swirling water. CUT TO: INT. STAIRWELL AND CORRIDORS Rose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. She climbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. The weight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons and shimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her stockings and kneelength slip, to find herself in A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward. She is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as the ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now. ROSE Hello? Somebody?! She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin of the water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through the water, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his eyes crazed... ROSE Help me! We need help! He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs with terrifying sounds. The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then they come back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life. A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He is upset to see someone still in his section. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) He grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child. STEWARD Come on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right. ROSE Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's STEWARD No need for panic, miss. Come along! ROSE No, let me go! You're going the wrong way! He's not listening. And he won't let her go. She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the nose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back. STEWARD To Hell with you! ROSE See you there, buster! The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Just the way Jack taugh: her. She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fireaxe in it. She breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way she came. AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the bottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the corridor to the room where Jack is trapped. Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powers forward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at the pain from the literally freezing water. CUT TO: INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE Jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe. Rose wades in, holding the axe above her head. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE Will this work? JACK We'll find out. They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He positions the chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe. The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either side of it. JACK Try a couple practice swings. Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet. JACK Now try to hit the same mark again. She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark. JACK Okay, that's enough practice. He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a target about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on either side. JACK (sounding calm) You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you can, I trust you. Jack closes his eyes. So does she. The axe comes down. KWHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack is grinning with two separate cuffs. Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her. JACK Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan. He climbs down into the water next to her. He can't breathe for a second. JACK Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) They wade out into the hall. Rose starts toward the stiars going up, but Jack stops her. There is only about a foot of the stairwell opening visible. JACK Too deep. We gotta find another way out. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT AND TITANIC TIGHT ON THE LETTERS TITANIC painted two feet high on the bow of the doomed steamer. Once feet above the waterline, they now quietly slip below the surface. We see them, gold on black, rippling and dimming to a pale green as they go deeper. IN BOAT SIX, Ruth looks back at the Titanic, transfixed by the sight of the dying liner. The bowsprit is now barely above the waterline. Another of Boxhall's rockets EXPLODES overhead. KBOOM! It lights up the whole area, and we see half a dozen boats in the water, spreading out from the ship. MOLLY Now there's somethin' you don't see every day. CUT TO: INT. SCOTLAND ROAD / EDECK The widest passageway in the ship, it is used by crew and steerage alike, and runs almost the length of the ship. Right now steerage passengers move along it like refugees, heading aft. CRASH! A wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open under the force of Jack's shoulder. Jack and Rose stumble through, into the corridor. A STEWARD, who was nearby herding people along, marches over. STEWARD Here you! You'll have to pay for that, you know. That's White Star Line property JACK AND ROSE (turning together) Shutup! . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) Jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward. They join the steerage stragglers going aft. In places the corridor is almost completely blocked by large families carrying all their luggage. AN IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than because she is bluelipped and shivering. IRISHWOMAN Here, lass, cover yerself. Jack rubs her arms and tries to warm her up as they walk along. The woman's husband offers them a flask of whiskey. IRISHMAN This'll take the chill off. Rose takes a mighty belt and hands it to Jack. He grins and follows suit. Jack tries a number of DOORS and IRON GATES along the way, finding them all locked. CUT TO: EXT.

WOMAN Will you hold the boat a moment? I have to run back to my room for something Lightoller grabs her and shoves her bodily into the boat. Thomas Andrews rushes up to him just then. ANDREWS Why are the boats being launched half full?! Lightoller steps past him, helping a seaman clear a snarled fall. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) LIGHTOLLER Not now, Mr. Andrews. ANDREWS (pointing down at the water) There, look... twenty or so in a boat built for sixty five. And I saw one boat with only twelve. Twelve!

The shot HANDS OFF to Cal, who sees Lovejoy hurrying toward him through the aisle connecting the port and starboard sides of the boat deck. LOVEJOY She's not on the starboard side either. CAL We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... (indicating Lightoller) ...isn't letting any men in at all. LOVEJOY The one on the other side is letting men in. CAL Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. (he starts off forward) Come on. Cal charges off, heading forward, followed by Lovejoy. The SHOT HANDS OFF to a finely dressed elderly couple, IDA and ISADOR STRAUSS. ISADOR Please, Ida, get into the boat. .

Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses on the foc'sle deck. Smith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck. Water is shipped over the sides and the well deck is awash.

Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the stairwell. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of the stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are squeezing through. STEWARD # Women only. No men. No men!! But some terrified men, not understanding English, try to rush through the gap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and stewards push them back, shoving and punching them. STEWARD # Get back! Get back you lot! (to the crewmen) Lock it!! They struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward # brandishes a small revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They lock the gate, and a cry goes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel and shouting in several languages. TOMMY For the love of God, man, there are children down here! Let us up, so we can have a chance! But the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation get out of hand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and pushes his way back through the crowd, going down the stairs. He rejoins Jack, Rose and Fabrizio. TOMMY It's hopeless that way. JACK Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast. Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood. FABRIZIO (with a lot of hand gestures) Everyone... all of you... come with me now. We go to the boats. We go to the boats. Capito? Come now! They can't understand what he's saying. They can see his urgency, but OLUF DAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. He will not panic, and will not let his family go with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) FABRIZIO Helga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny to go to America. She kisses him, then steps back to be with her family.

Looking back Fabrizio sees her face disappear into the crowd. CUT TO: OMITTED OMITTED INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside.

They push past confused passengers... past a mother changing her baby's diaper on top of an upturned steamer trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in Serbo Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling to console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing... and past another man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what the signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) Jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before they are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate. The steerage men are yelling at a scared STEWARD. STEWARD Go to the main stairwell, with everyone else. It'll all get sorted out there. Jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it. JACK God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!! He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He starts pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the stairs between the waiting people. ROSE Move aside! Quickly, move aside! Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATE with all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward, narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone: ROSE If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job ROSE (CONT'D) with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to the boat deck... now. Class wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT / TITANIC NIGHT Ruth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors. She rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship. It slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. Nothing is above water forward of the bridge except for the foremast. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Another rocket goes off, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outward from the ship. AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL Captain Smith is shouting to Boat through a large metal megaphone. SMITH Come back! Come back to the ship! CHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle. FROM BOAT the whistle comes shrilly across the water. Quartermaster Hitchins grips the rudder in fear. HITCHINS The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going. MOLLY We got room for lots more. I say we go back. HITCHINS No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!! CAPTAIN SMITH, at the rail of the boat deck, lowers his megaphone slowly SMITH The fools. CUT TO: INT. ADECK FOYER As Cal and Lovejoy cross the foyer encounter Benjamin Guggenheim and his valet, coth dressed in white tie, tail coats and top hats. CAL Ben, what's the occasion? GUGGENHEIM We have dressed in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen. CAL That's admirable, Ben. (walking on) I'll sure and tell your wife... when I get to New York. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM There are still two cardgames in progress. The room is quiet and civilized. A silver serving cart, holding a large humidor, begins to roll slowly across the room. One of the cardplayers takes a cigar from it as it rolls by. CARDPLAYER It seems we've been dealt a bad hand this time. CUT TO: EXT. / INT. ADECK PROMENADE Cal and Lovejoy are walking aft with a purposeful stride. They pass CHIEF BAKER JOHGHIN, who is working up a sweat tossing deck chairs over the rail. After they go by, Joughin takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from a pocket, opening it. He drains it, and tosses it over the side too, then stands there a little unteadily. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK AND ADECK, AFT PANIC IS SETTING IN around the remaining boats aft. The crowd here is now a mix of all three classes. Officers repeatedly warn men back from the boats. The crowd presses in closer. Seamen SCAROTT brandishes the tiller of boat to discourage a close press of men who look ready to rush the boat. Several men break ranks and rush forward. Lightoller pulls out his Webley revolver and aims it at them. LIGHTOLLER Get back! Keep order! The men back down. Fifth Officer Lowe standing in the boat, yells to the crew. LOWE Lower away left and right! Lightoller turns away from the crowd and, out of their sight, breaks his pistol open. Letting out a long breath, he starts to LOAD IT. CUT TO: . EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE, AFT Cal and Lovejoy arrive in time to see Murdoch lowering his last boat. CAL We're too late. LOVEJOY There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical. IN THE WATER BELOW there is another panic. Boat , already in the water but still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge water being pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly under boat , which is coming downt he right on top of it. The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering. They are ignored. Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the tons of boat from crushing them. Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls, climbing rudely over people. He cuts the aft falls while another crewman cuts the forward lines. drifts out from beneath just seconds before it touches the water with a slap. Cal, looking down from the rail hears GUNSHOTS CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK / ADECK, PORT, AFT Fifth Officer Lowe, in Boat is firing his gun as a warning to a bunch of men threatening to jump into the boat as it passes the open promenade on ADeck. LOWE Stay back you lot! BLAM! BLAM! CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD, AFT The shots echo away. . (CONTINUED) CAL It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time. Cal sees three dogs run by, including the black French bulldog. Someone has released the pets from the kennels. Cal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat and start walking toward the bow. He catches up and falls in beside him. CAL Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a business proposition for you. CUT TO: OMITTED EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT Jack, Rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aft of the third funnel. They look at the empty davits. ROSE The boats are gone! She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting two first class ladies. ROSE Colonel! Are there any boats left? GRACIE (staring at her bedraggled state) Yes, miss... there are still a couple of boats all the way forward. This way, I'll lead you! Jack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy and Fabrizio close behind. ANGLE ON THE BAND... incredibly they are still playing. Jack, Rose and the others run by. TOMMY Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in First Class. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD, FORWARD Water pours like a spillway over the forward railing on B Deck. CAMERA SWEEPS UP past ADeck to the Boat Deck where Murdoch and his team are loading Collapsible Car the forward most davits. NOTE: There are four socalled collapsibles, or Engelhardts boats, including two which are stored on the roof of the officer's quarters. The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. Cal slips his hand out of hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of Murdoch's greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there. CAL So we have an understanding then? MURDOCH (nodding curtly) As you've said. Cal, satisfied, steps back. He finds himself waiting next to J. Bruce Ismay. Ismay does not meet his eyes, nor anyone's. Lovejoy come sup to Cal at that moment. LOVEJOY I've found her. She's just over on the port side. With him. MURDOCH Women and children? Any more women and children? (glancing at Cal) Any one else, then? Cal looks longingly at his boat... his moment has arrived. CAL God damn it to hell! Come on. He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a shortcut through the bridge. Bruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. He stares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes. . (CONTINUED) MURDOCH (staring at Ismay) Take them down. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE NIGHT ON THE PORT SIDE Lightoller is getting people into Boat . He keeps his pistol in his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is pouring into the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar of water cascading into the ship. LIGHTOLLER Women and children, please. Women and children only. Step back, sir. Even with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold. Near her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks into the eyes of a HUSBAND she knows she may not see again HUSBAND Goodbye for a little while... only for a little while. (to his two little girls) Go with mummy. The woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from them. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion. HUSBAND Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl. That's right. Some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to be helped into the boats. A MAN scribbles a note and hands it to a woman who is about to board. MAN Please get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa. Jack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio. JACK You better check out the other side. They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE I'm not going without you. JACK Get in the boat, Rose. Cal walks up just then. CAL Yes. Get in the boat, Rose. She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking display in . CAL My God, look at you. (taking off his boat) Here, put this on. She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold. LIGHTOLLER Quickly, ladies. Step into the boat. Hurry, please! JACK Go on. I'll get the next one. ROSE No. Not without you! She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotion between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to her and says... CAL (low) There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us. JACK (he smiles reassuringly) I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch. CAL Get in... hurry up, it's almost full. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out for Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herself stepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur. LIGHTOLLER Lower away! The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend. CAL (low) You're a good liar. JACK Almost as good as you. CAL I always win, Jack. One way or another. (looks at him, smiling) Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning. Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a second of his last view of her. ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller giving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in slowmotion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling... Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face. SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches the gunwale, climbing it... Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the ADeck promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat continues down. But Rose is back on Titanic. JACK No Rose! NOOOO!! Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to ADeck. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, this gutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all thought. CUT TO: INT. GRAND STAIRCASE TRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints down the stairs. He sees her coming into Adeck foyer, running toward him, Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs. They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace. JACK Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can. ROSE You jump, I jump, right? JACK Right. Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND on him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband in one cobrafast move. He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES. The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls Rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again, running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of stairs. Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: () INT. DDECK RECEPTION ROOM The bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet deep. Jack and Rose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water, fording across the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dry footing at the entrance to the dining saloon. STEADICAM WITH HOCKLEY as he reels down the stairs in time to see Jack and Rose splashing through the water toward the dining saloon. He FIRES twice. Big gouts of spray near them, but he's not a great shot. The water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a couple of steps. Around him the woodward groans and creaks. CAL (calling to them) Enjoy your time together!! Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts to laugh. LOVEJOY What could possible be funny? CAL I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her. He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering. CAL I give it to you... if you can get it. He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinks about it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist as he crosses the pool into the dining saloon. CUT TO: INT. DINING SALOON Lovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns, searching... listening... his eyes tracking rapidly. It is a sea of tables, and they could be anywhere. A silver serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping into tables and pillars. . (CONTINUED) He glances behind him. The water is following him into the room, advancing in a hundred foot wide tide. The reception room is now a roiling lake, and the grand staircase is submerged past the first landing. Monstrous groans echo through the ship. ON JACK AND ROSE, crouched behind a table, somewhere in the middle. They see the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor. They crawl ahead of it to the next row of tables. JACK (whispering) Stay here. He moves off as Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing. The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row. ANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes. It starts to roll down the aisle between tables. ON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks of dishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her. She scrambles out of the way and Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gun aimed That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into a table, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the water which is flowing rapidly between the tables. Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down on Lovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoy scrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solar plexus, doubling him over. JACK Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to the floor with a splas, stunned. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) JACK Let's go. Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them the tables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room is flooded up to the ceiling. Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of the water and wades after them. CUT TO: INT. GALLEY / STAIRWELL They run throught the galley and Rose spots the stairs. She starts up and Jack grabs her hand. He leads her DOWN. They crouch together on the landing as Lovejoy runs to the stairs. Assuming they have gone up (who wouldn't?) he clombs up them two at a time. They wait for the footstep to recede. A long CREAKING GROAN. Then they hear it... a CRYING CHILD. Below them. They go down a frew steps to looks along the next deck. CUT TO: INT. EDECK CORRIDORS The corridor is awash, about a foot deep. Standing against the wall, about feet away, is a little BOY, aobut . The water swirls around his legs and he is wailing. ROSE We can't leave him. Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to the child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds it is too powerful for them to go against. JACK Come on. Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with each footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jack approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors right up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tons of pressure. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) JACK Back! Go back!! Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a crosscorridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack's arms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him in Russian. He runs on with the boy ROSE No! Not that way! Come back! DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor. The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly. Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor to ceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairway going up. CUT TO: INT. STAIRWELL Jack and Rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up behind them. PULL BACK to reveal that a steel gate blocks the top of the stairs. Jack SLAMS against the fate, gripping the bars. A terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at the sight of the water thundering up the stairs. JACK Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate. The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouring through the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to their waist. ROSE Help us! Please! The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, their arms raching through... sees the water POURING through the gate onto the landing. STEWARD Fucking 'ell! He runs back, slogging against the curretn. He pulls a key ring from his belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around them. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) The lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness. The water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel. JACK Come on! Come on! Jack and Rose are right up against the ceiling... Suddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing through by the force of the water. They make it to stairs on the other side of the landing and follow the steward up to the next deck. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE Cal comes reeling out of the first class entrance, looking wildeyed. The lurches down the deck toward the bridge. Waltz music wafts over the ship. Somewhere the band is still playing. CAL'S POV: A little girl, maybe two years old, is crying along in the alcove. She looks up at Cal beseechingly. Cal moves on without a glance back... reaching a large crowd clustered around COLLAPSIBLE A just aft of the bridge. He sees Murdoch and a number of crewmen struggling to drag the boat to the davits, with no luck. Cal pushes forward, trying to signal Murdoch, but the officer ignores him. Nearby Tommy and Fabrizio are being pushed forward by the crowd behind. PURSER MCELROY pushes them back, getting a couple of seamen to help him. He brandishes his gun, waving it in the air, yelling for the crowd to stay back. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT SIDE / ROOF OF OFFICERS' QUARTERS Lightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is trying to get Collapsible B down from the roof. They slide it down a pair of oars leaned against the deck house. LIGHTOLLER Hold it! Hold it! . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) The weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the deck, upside down. The two Swedish cousins, OLAUS and BJORN GUNERSEN, jump back as the boat nearly hits them. CUT TO: OMITTED INT. STAIRWELL Jack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans and torgues around them. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE Murdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd is threatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting at the officers. The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below. TOMMY Give us a chance to live, you limey bastards! Murdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd. MURDOCH I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me. Cal steps up to him. CAL We had a deal, damn you. Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal. MURDOCH Get back! A man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from behind. Murdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts a bullet into his chest. Tommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his life flows out over the deck. Murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts the pistol to his temple and... BLAM! . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) He drops like a puppet with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet below. Cal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. The MONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across the surface. The crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat. PURSER MCELROY (calling above the confusion) Any more women or children?! THE CHILD crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward, cradling her in his arms. CAL (forcing his way through the crowd) Here's a child! I've got a child! CAL (CONT'D) (to McElroy) Please... I'm all she has in the world. McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun, brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into the boat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women. CAL There, there. CUT TO: INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKE ROOM Thomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large painting above the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace. The room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table. Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. They run through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She sees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table. ROSE Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ANDREWS (a tear rolls down his cheek) I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose. JACK (to her) It's going fast... we've got to keep moving. Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her. ANDREWS Good luck to you, Rose. ROSE (hugging him) And to you, Mr. Andrews. Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS The band finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestra members. HARTLEY Right, that's it then. They leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts his violin to his chin and bows the first notes of """"Nearer My God to Thee"""". One by one the band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody. Without a word they walk back and take their places. They join in with Hartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this still night. The vocalist begins: """"If in my dreams I be, nearer my God to thee..."""" THE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE: A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as he walks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him. Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosed WHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming brass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse. IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls out his pocketwatch and checks the time. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Then he opens the face of the mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: : a.m. Everything must be correct. IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck. Rose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water's surface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life. DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on a bed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at the ceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room through a doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast. IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the young IRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking her two young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they are all warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothingly and holding them. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK / BRIDGE IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge house sinks into the water. ON THE PORT SIDE Collapsible B is picked up by water. Working frantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't drag it under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he saws furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, still upside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to stay with it. IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has completely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as they work, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag the collapsible under. Fabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it on as the water rises around him. CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black water climbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the stricken expression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenly and a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. He disappears in a vortex of foam. Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. It partially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Over a hundred passengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat becomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people. As men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar and pushes them back into the water. CAL Get back! You'll swamp us! Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes and pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he is dragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back to the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water. WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them. He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers his violin. HARTLEY Gentlemen, it has been a previlege playing with you tonight. CUT TO: EXT. ADECK AFT, PORT SIDE Jack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes his way to the rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is under water and tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on. People stream around them, shouting and pushing. JACK Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as possible. They push their way aft through the panicking crowd. CUT TO: EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL Collapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining ship. It slams against the side of the forward funnel. CAL (to the crew in the boat) Row! Row you bastards!! . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) NEARBY: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT as water pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring down the ship traps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the ship sinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot. Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnace explodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejecting Fabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming. CUT TO: EXT. ADECK / BDECK / WELL DECK, AFT Jack and Rose clamber over the ADeck aft rail. Then, using all his strength, he lowers her toward the deck below, holding on with one hand. She dangles, then falls. Jack jumps down behind her. They join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over each other to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck... the only way aft. Seeing that the stairs are impossible, Jack climbs over the BDeck railing and helps Rose over. He lowers her again, and she falls in a heap. Baker Joughin, now three sheets to the wind, happens to be next to her. He hauls Rose to her feet. Jack drops down and the three of them push through the crowd across the well deck. Near them, at the rail, people are jumping into the water. The ship GROANS and SHUDDERS. The man ahead of Jack is walking like a zombie. MAN Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death JACK You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella? CUT TO: EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL The stay cables along the top of the funnel snap, and they lash like steel whips down into the water. Cal watches as the funnel topples from its mounts. Falling like a temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whomps into the water with a tremendous splash. People swimming underneath it disappear in an instant. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Fabrizio, a few feet away, is hurled back by a huge wave. He comes up, gasping... still swimming. The water pouring into the open end of the funnel draws in several swimmers. The funnel sinks, disappearing, but Hundreds of tons of water pour down through the foot hole where the funnel stood, thundering down into the belly of the ship. A whirlpool forms, a hole in the ocean, like at enormous toilerflush. T. W. McCauley, the gym instructor swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in. He is sucked down like a spider going down a drain. Fabrizio, nearby, swims like Hell as more people are sucked down behind him. He manages to get clear. He's going to live no matter what it takes. CUT TO: INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / GRAND STAIRCASE Water raors through the doors and windows, cascading down the stairs like a rapids. John Jacob Astor is swept down the marble steps to ADeck, which is already flooded... a roiling vortex. He grabs the headless cherub at the bottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it. Astor looks up in time to see the foot glass dome overhead EXPLOSE INWARD with the wave of water washing over it. A Niagara of sea water thunders down into the room, blasting through the first class opulence. IT is the Armageddon of elegance. CUT TO: OMITTED INT. BELOWDECKS The flooding is horrific. Walls and doors are splintered like kindling. Water roars down corridors with piledriver force. The CARTMELL FAMILY is at the top of a stairwell, jammed against a locked gate like Jack and Rose were. Water boils up the stairwell behind them. Bert Cartmell shakes the gate futilely, shouting for help. Little Cora wails as the water boils up around them all. CUT TO: . CONTINUED: EXT. STERN Rose and Jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the ship tilts. Drunk Baker Joughin puts a hand squarely on Rose's butt and shoves her up onto the deck. JOUGHIN Sorry, miss! Hundreds of people are already on the poop deck, and more are pouring up every second. Jack and Rose cling together as tehy struggle across the tilting deck. As the bow goes down, the STERN RISES. IN BOAT , which is just off the stern, passengers gape as the giant bronze propellers rise out of the water like gods of the deep, FILLING FRAME behind them. People are JUMPING from the well deck, the poop deck, the gangway doors. Some hit debris in the water and are hurt or killed. OMITTED OMITTED EXT. STERN ON THE POOP DECK Jack and Rose struggle aft as the angle increases. Hundreds of passengers, clinging to every fixed object on deck, huddle on their knees around FATHER BYLES, who has his voice raised in prayer. They are praying, sobbing, or just staring at nothing, their minds blank with dread. Pulling himself from handhold to handhold, Jack tugs Rose aft along the deck. JACK Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us. They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses his footing ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him. THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster. JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of the flagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spot where Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and a liftime... ago. . (CONTINUED) Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking with emotion. FATHER BYLES ...and I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former earth had passed away and the sea was no longer. The lights flicker, threatening to go out. Rose grips Jack as the stern rises into a night sky ablaze with stars. FATHER BYLES I also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy city coming down out of heaven from God, beautiful as a bride prepared to meet her husband. I heard a loud voice from the throne ring out this is God's dwelling among men. He shall dwell with them and they shall be his people and He shall be their God who is alway with them. Rose stares about her at the faces of the doomed. Near them are the DAHL FAMILY, clinging together stoically. Helga looks at her briefly, and her eyes are infinitely sad. Rose sees a young mother next to her, clutching her five year old son, who is crying in terror. MOTHER Shhh. Don't cry. It'll be over soon, darling. It'll all be over soon. FATHER BYLES He shall wipe every tear from their eyes. And there shall be no more death or mourning, crying out or pain, for the former world has passed away. CUT TO: INT. SHIP VARIOUS As the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside shifts. CUPBOARDS burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons of china. A PIANO slides across the floor, crashing into a wall. FURNITURE tumbles across the Smoking Room floor. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ON THE ADECK PROMENADE passengers lose their grip and slide down the wooden deck like a bobsled run, hundreds of feet before they hit the water. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, slips as she struggles along the railing and slides away screaming. AT THE STERN the propellers are feet out of the water and rising. Panicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming and hit the water like mortar rounds. A man falls from the poop deck, hitting the bronze hub of the starboard propeller with a sickening smack. SWIMMERS LOOK UP and see the stern towering over them like a monolith, the propellers rising against the stars. feet. . AT THE STERN RAIL a man jumps. IN HIS POV we fall seemingly forever, right past one of the giant screws. The water rushes up CUT TO: EXT. TITANIC / BOAT TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and the screaming people come across the water. REVERSE / HER POV: IN A WIDE SHOT we see the spectacle of the Titanic, her lights blazing, reflecting in the still water. Its stern is high in the air, angles up over forty five degrees. The propellers are feet out of the water. Over a thousand passengers cling to the decks, looking from a distance like a swarm of bees. The image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable. Ruth stares at the spectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any proportion. MOLLY BROWN God Almighty. The great liner's lights flicker. CUT TO: INT. ENGINE ROOM In darkness Chief Engineer Bell hangs onto a pipe at the master braker panel. Around him men climb through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electric handtorches. It is a black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and groaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Water sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will not leave his post. CLUNK. The breakers kick. He slams them in again and WHOOM! a blast of light! Something melts and arcing fills the engine room with nightmarish light CUT TO: EXT. TITANIC WIDE SHOT. The lights go out all over the ship. Titanic becomes a vast black silhouette against the stars. IN COLLAPSIBLE C: BRUCE ISMAY has his back to the ship, unable to watch the great steamer die. He is catatonic with remorse, his mind overloaded. He can avert his eyes, but he can't block out the sounds of dying people and machinery. A loud CRACKING REPORT comes across the water. CUT TO: EXT. BOAT DECK Near the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail. He stares down as the DECK SPLITS right between his feet. A yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER of breaking steel LOVEJOY is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess. He watches in horror as the ship's structure RIPS APART right in front of him. He gapes down into a widening maw, seeing straight down into the bowels of the ship, amid a BOOMING CONCUSSION like the sound of artillery. People falling into the widening crevasse look like dolls. The stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips, ripping off davits and ventilators. A man is hit by a whipping cable and snatched OUT OF FRAME. Another cable smashes the rail next to Lovejoy and it rips free. He falls backward into the pit of jagged metal. Fires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splits down through nine decks to the keel. The sea pours into the gaping wound CUT TO: INT. ENGINE ROOM It is a thundering black hell. Men scream as monstrous machinery comes apart around them, steel frames twisting like taffy. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Their torches illuminate the roaring, foaming demon of water as it races at the through the manchines. Trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds. CUT TO: EXT. TITANIC NIGHT The STERN ALF of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward the water. On the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves plummeting. The sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium when a run is scored. Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water. Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation. SEVERAL PEOPLE We're saved! Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly. Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF ASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches, railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts. The stern goes up and up, past degrees, then past sixty. People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people loose and pull them down as well. There is a pileup of bodies at the forward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one. JACK We have to move! He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified to move. He grabs her hand. JACK Come on! I've got you! . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her fiercely. The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable. Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators. Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern. Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them. Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment. JOUGHIN (nodding a greeting) Helluva night. The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and Rose. JACK (talking fast) Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me. She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder. ROSE I trust you. Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the water. Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean. CUT TO: EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them. Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding tightly to Rose, pulling her up. AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning, shouting... screaming. Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire. A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES him repeatedly, pulling her free. JACK Swim, Rose! SWIM! She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water. JACK Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it. All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming. CUT TO: OMITTED . CONTINUED: () EXT. OCEAN Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing. JACK Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. ROSE It's so cold. JACK I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them. Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns and... SCREAMS. A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG, swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes bugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland. Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water. ROSE What's that? Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down. But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges, almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can. Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him back. JACK It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under. MAN Let me try at least, or I'll die soon. . (CONTINUED) JACK You'll die quicker if you come any closer. MAN Yes, I see. Good luck to you then. (swimming off) God bless. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN The boat is overloaded and halfflooded. Men cling to the sides in the water. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing in the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning. CAL Stay back! Keep off! Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp. FABRIZIO You don't... understand... I have... to get... to America. CAL (pointing with the oar) It's that way! CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the spirit leave him. FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon in a tuxedo. The image fades to black. CUT TO: EXT. OCEAN JACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship's officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously, knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles. JACK The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering. ROSE Thank God for you Jack. People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats. WOMAN Come back! Please! We know you can hear us. For God's sake! MAN Please... help us. Save one life! SAVE ON LIFE! CUT TO: EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN IN BOAT : Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness. The first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of hundreds screaming. HITCHINS They'll pull us right down I tell ya! MOLLY Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go. (nobody moves) Well come on! The women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine wraps. MOLLY I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more. HITCHINS If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat! Ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it all out. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) IN BOAT ONE: Sir Cosmo and Lucile DuffGordon sit with ten other people in a boat that is two thirds empty. They are two hundred yards from the screaming in the darkness. FIREMAN HENDRICKSON We should do something. Lucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. She is terrified. SIR COSMO It's out of the question. The crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. They hunch guiltily, hoping the sound will stop soon. TWENTY BOATS, most half full, float in the darkness. None of them make a move. CUT TO: EXT. OCEAN Jack and Rose drift under the blazing stars. The water is glassy, with only the faintest undulating swell. Rose can actually see the stars reflecting on the black mirror of the sea. Jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly around her legs. He rubs her arms. His face is chalk with in the darkness. A low MOANING in the darknes around them. ROSE It's getting quiet. JACK Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized... Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won't be any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving. He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died of exposure already. JACK I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyes in the dim light. ROSE I love you Jack. He takes her hand. JACK No... don't say your goodbyes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it. ROSE I'm so cold. JACK You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me? ROSE I can't feel my body. JACK Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me. Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak. JACK It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful. His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart. But his eyes are unwavering. JACK You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise. ROSE I promise. JACK Never let go. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go. She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now, except for the lapping of the water. CUT TO: EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN NIGHT Fifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats , and Collapsible D together with his own Boat . A demon of energy, he's had everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt. As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawled figure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl off, and finds himself staring into the face of a man. He angrily shoves the stowaway into another boat and turns to his crew of three. LOWE Right, man the oars. CUT TO: EXT. OCEAN / BOAT The beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as boat comes toward us. ANGLE FROM THE BOAT as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant trail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a steerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera. Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, the first bodies come into the torch's beam. The people are dead but not drowned, killed by the freezing water. Some look like they could be sleeping. Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars. Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on the heads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. One seaman throws up. Lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) LOWE (the worst moment of his life) We waited too long. CUT TO: EXT. OCEAN IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack and Rose floating in the black water. The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be floating in interstellar space. They are absolutely still. Their hands are locked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling above her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep steals over Rose, and she feels peace. CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to be floating in a void. Rose is in a semi hallucinatory state. She knows she is dying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song: ROSE """"Come Josephine in my flying machine..."""" ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a glorious band from horizon to horizon. A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens. TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals. Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track down from the stars to the water. ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars. She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water, leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men sound slow and DISTORTED. Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her motionless form and moves on. The boat is feet away, and moving past her. The men look away. Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to the wood under her. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) ROSE (barely audible) Jack. She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost. He seems to be sleeping peacefully. But he is not asleep. Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her. ROSE Oh, Jack. All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go. She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try. And then... her eyes snap open. She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles to draw breath, calling again. IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something ahead, turning the tiller. ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film. ROSE I won't let go. I promise. She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane. Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across the still water. . CONTINUED: (CONTINUED) IN BOAT Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle. LOWE (turning the tiller) Row back! That way! Pull! Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets... DISSOLVE TO: INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH EXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day. OLD ROSE Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred. As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality of what happened here years before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers. Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond. OLD ROSE Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA PREDAWN MATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved. .

Cal, sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a blackfaced stoker... Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently. IN BOAT : CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, white as the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent, SLOW MOTION. IN SLOWMOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human emotion. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA DAWN Golden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea reflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships, are icebergs.

Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face blank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's gangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship... ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOWMOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever. THE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself, coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warm blankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the face and eyes of a damned soul. As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes. CUT TO: EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA DAY It is the afternoon of the th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck, looking for Rose. .

He keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward approaches him. CARPATHIA STEWARD You won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage. Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another. Rose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he * approaches her.

His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read. ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, pm April th. She gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind. LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier . Over , people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau. Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the equicalent of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions. Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway. IMMIGRATION OFFICER Name? . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) ROSE Dawson. Rose Dawson. The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode. Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the confusion. OLD ROSE (V.O.) Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic?

I don't know what to * say to a woman who tries to jump off * the Titanic when it's not sinking, * and jumps back onto it when it is... * we're not dealing with logic here, * I know that... but please... think * about this a second. * ROSE * I have. I came all the way here so * this could go back where it belongs. * The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds * out his hand... * LOVETT * Just let me hold it in my hand, * Rose. Please. Just once. * He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly * moving up to her at the stern of Titanic. * Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the * palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace. * Lovett gazes at the object of his quest. An infinity of * cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is mesmerizing. * It fits in his hand just like he imagined. * LOVETT * My God. * His grip tightens on the diamond. * He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly * infinitely wise and deep. * ROSE * You look for treasures in the wrong * place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is * priceless, and making each day * count. * His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips * the diamond out of his hand. He feels it sliding away. * . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace * over the rail. Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to * the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear * forever. * BODINE * Aww!! That really sucks, lady! * Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a * reaction... HE LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to * his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy. * LOVETT * Would you like to dance? * Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at * the stars. IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end over end, into the infinate depths. CUT TO: INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH A GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures: Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studio publicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rose with her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children and grandchildren at her th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived well. THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa . She is at the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with its rollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life. We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profile shot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else. CUT TO: BLACKNESS THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by a kind of moonlight, a light of the mind. . CONTINUED: () (CONTINUED) We pass over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost like we are flying. WE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. The rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is transformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing chandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in tie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful. IN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen and ladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with his back to us... he turns and it is Jack.
