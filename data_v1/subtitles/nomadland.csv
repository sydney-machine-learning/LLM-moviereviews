Is he dead? No.No, no. His daughter cameand took him back East. Oh. Yeah.But they didn'ttake the dog?They couldn't take him.Would you liketo have him? Uh... He's really a good dog.

Good luck with that. Mmm. Mmm‐hmm. That's tough. Bye, Patty. Bye, Fern.We'll see you next year.Thank you. Have a nice day.My husband workedat the USG mine in Empireand I workedin human resources therefor a few years.That wasmy last full‐time job.I did a lot ofpart‐time jobs.I cashieredat the Empire Store.I was a substitute teacher atthe school for five years...Didn't the Empire Mineshut downand then all of the residentworkers had to relocate? Yeah, about a year ago. Wow.So, when do you needto get back to work?Now?It is a tough timeright now.You may wantto considerregistering forearly retirement.I don't think I can get byon the benefits, and, um...I need work. I like work.I'm not sure exactly whatyou would be eligible for. Hi, there. Hi!I'm Rachel.I'm the manager here at Fox Peak.Hi, I'm Fern.Hi, Fern.Um, I asked someone, they saidI could park here overnight.Oh, you're fine.You're more than welcome.But you know,the temperature is gonna drop.It gets really coldhere at night.

Keep the chair.Thank you.And the odd thingis that we...We not only acceptthe tyranny of the dollar,the tyrannyof the marketplace,we embrace it.We gladly throw the yokeof the tyrannyof the dollar onand live by itour whole lives.I think of an analogyas a workhorse.The workhorse that is willingto work itself to deathand then beput out to pasture.And that's what happensto so many of us.If societywas throwing us awayand sending us, the workhorse,out to the pasture,we workhorseshad to gather togetherand take careof each other.And that's whatthis is all about.The way I see it is thatthe Titanic is sinkingand economic timesare changing.And so my goal isto get the lifeboats outand get as many peopleinto the lifeboats as I can.Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.There's plenty.Yeah. We got plenty.Jump and shout.How many veganswe got here?Let you know, huh? What's that? Vegan.This is vegan. No, I'm... I'm a carnivore. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yes.Okay. Thank you,though. Looks good. Another carnivore? She's a carnivore. Okay.Mac 'n' cheese.Just tell me when?You good? More?Oh! She likesthe red peppers. Cilantro? No!No!No! No, no.I'm a Vietnam vet.And, um, I got PTSD.I really can't handleloud noises,uh, big crowds, fireworks.I got a pickup truckand a camper.I can live out here...and be at peace.I had, um,finally convinced my grandpa,and my papa, and my mama,that we shouldtake off in an RVand see the country.But then both of them weretold that they had cancer,they passed awaythree weeks apart.I began watchingBob Wells' videoson van‐dwelling.Then I bought my van...Paint, because she takes mewhere I ain't.Andstarted my healing journeytwo and a half years ago.Um, I workedfor corporate America,you know, for  years.And my friend, Bill,worked for the same company,and he had liver failure.A week beforehe was due to retire,HR called him in hospice,and said...""Let's talk aboutyour retirement.""And he died  days later,having never been ableto take that sailboatthat he boughtout of his driveway.And he missed outon everything.And he told mebefore he died,""Just don't wasteany time, Merle.""Don't waste any time.""So I retiredas soon as I could.I didn't wantmy sailboatto be in the drivewaywhen I died...so, yeah...And it's not.My sailboat's out herein the desert.I can't imaginewhat you're going through,the loss of your husband,and the loss of your wholetown, and friends,and village,and that kind of lossis never easy.And I wish I hadan easy answer for you.But I think you've cometo the right placeto find an answer.I think that...I think connecting to natureand to a real true communityand tribe,will make all the differencefor you.I hope so.Hey, Fern.Hey, Linda.Come over and join us.No, I'm just gonnatake a little walk. Okay. Be back soon.Hey. Good morning... Bob.
