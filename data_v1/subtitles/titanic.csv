Hello. Brock.Hello, Tracy. Of course, everyone knowsthe familiar stories of Titanic.You know, the nobility of theband playing to the very end and all that.But what I'm interested in are the untold stories.The secrets locked deep inside the hull of Titanic.And we're out here using robottechnology to go further into the wreck...than anybody has ever done before.Your expedition is at the centerof a storm of controversy...over salvage rights and even ethics.Many are calling you a graverobber.Well, nobody ever called therecovery of the artifacts...What is it?Turn that up, dear.I have museumtrained expertssent out here making sure...that these relics are preservedand catalogued properly.Take a look at this drawingthat we found just today.A piece of paper that's been underwaterfor  years.And my team are able topreserve it intact.Should this have remained unseenat the bottom of the ocean for eternity...when we can see and enjoy it now?I'll be goddamned.Brock!There's a satellite call for you.Bobby, we're launching. You seethese submersibles going in the water?Trust me, buddy.You want to take this call.This better be good.Now, you gotta speak up.She's kind of old.Great.This is Brock Lovett.How can I help you, Mrs...?Calvert. Rose Calvert.Mrs. Calvert.I was just wondering if you had found...the ""Heart of theOcean"" yet, Mr. Lovett.Told you you wanted to take the call.All right, you have myattention, Rose.Can you tell us who the womanin the picture is?Oh, yes. The woman in the picture is me.She's a goddamn liar!Some nutcase seeking money or publicity.God only knows why.Like that Russian babe, Anesthesia.They're inbound!Rose DeWitt Bukater died on theTitanic when she was , right? That's right. If she had lived, she'd be over  by now. next month.Okay, so she's a very old goddamn liar.Look, I've already done thebackground on this woman...all the way back to the s,when she was working as an actress.An actress.There's your first clue, Sherlock.Her name was Rose Dawson back then.Then she marries this guy named Calvert.They move to Cedar Rapidsand she punches out a couple of kids.Now Calvert's dead and, from whatI hear, Cedar Rapids is dead.And everybody who knows about thediamond is supposed to be dead...or on this boat, but she knows.Doesn't exactly travel light, does she?Hurry up, give him a hand.Mrs. Calvert, I'm Brock Lovett.Welcome to the Keldysh.Okay, let's get her inside there.Hi, Miss Calvert. Hi. Welcome to the Keldysh.Thanks.Hey!Are your staterooms all right?Oh, yes.Very nice.Have you met mygranddaughter, Lizzy?She takes care of me.We met just a few minutes ago.Remember, Nana? Up on deck?Oh, yes.There. That's nice.Have to have mypictures when I travel.Can I get you anything?Is there anything you'd like?Yes.I would like to see my drawing.Louis XVI wore a fabulousstone that was...called the Blue Diamondof the Crown...which disappeared in ...about the same time old Louis losteverything from the neck up.The theory goes that thecrown diamond was chopped, too.Recut into a heartlike shape thatbecame known as...the Heart of the Ocean.Today it would be worthmore than the Hope diamond.It was a dreadful, heavy thing.I only wore it this once.You actually thinkthis is you, Nana?It is me, dear.Wasn't I a dish?I tracked it downthrough insurance records.An old claim that was settledunder terms of absolute secrecy.Can you tell me who theclaimant was, Rose?I should imagine someonenamed Hockley.Nathan Hockley, that's right.Pittsburgh steel tycoon.The claim was for adiamond necklace his son...Caledon, bought his fiancée.You.A week before hesailed on Titanic.And it was filed rightafter the sinking.So the diamond had to havegone down with the ship.You see the date?April , .Which means if your grandmotheris who she says she is...she was wearing the diamondthe day the Titanic sank.And that makes youmy new best friend.These are some of the thingswe recovered from your stateroom.This was mine.How extraordinary.And it looks the same as itdid the last time I saw it.The reflection haschanged a bit.Are you ready to goback to Titanic?Okay, here we go.She hits the berg onthe starboard side, right?She kind of bumps along...punching holes likemorse code...ditditdit... along the side...below the water line.Then the forward compartmentsstart to flood.Now, as the waterlevel rises...it spills over thewatertight bulkheads...which, unfortunately, don't goany higher than E deck.So now as the bow goes down...the stern rises up,slow at first...then faster and faster...until finally, she's got her wholeass sticking up in the air.And that's a big ass.We're talking, , tons. Okay?And the hull's not designedto deal with that pressure.So, what happens?She splits, rightdown to the keel.And the stern...falls back level.Then...as the bow sinks...it pulls the stern vertical...and then finally detaches.Now the stern section just kind of bobs therelike a cork for a couple of minutes...floods, and finally goesunder about : AM... hours and  minutesafter the collision.The bow section planes away...landing about ahalf a mile away...going ,  knots whenit hits the ocean floor.Pretty cool?Thank you for that fineforensic analysis, Mr. Bodine.Of course, theexperience of it was...somewhat different.Will you share it with us?I'm taking her to rest.No.Come on, Nana.No!Give me the tape recorder.Tell us, Rose.It's been  years...It's okay. Just tryto remember anything...anything at all.Do you want to hear thisor not, Mr. Lovett?It's been  years...and I can still smellthe fresh paint.The china had never been used.The sheets hadnever been slept in.Titanic was calledthe ship of dreams.And it was.It really was.All thirdclass passengers...with a forward berth...this way please! This queue!It's a big boat?Daddy, it's a ship.You're right.I don't see what allthe fuss is about.It doesn't look any biggerthan the Mauretania.You can be blaséabout some things, Rose...but not about Titanic.It's over  feet longerthan Mauretania...and far more luxurious.Your daughter is far toodifficult to impress, Ruth.So this is the ship theysay is unsinkable.It is unsinkable.God Himselfcould not sink this ship...What?!You have to check your baggagethrough the main terminal.It's round that way, sir.I put my faith in you good sir.Now kindly see my man.Yes sir. It's my pleasure, sir.If I can do anything at all...Yes, right.All the trunks fromthat car there. from here.And the safe,to the parlor suite...rooms B, , .Ladies...we better hurry.Come along. My coat? I have it, miss.All thirdclass passengersqueue here for health inspection. Welcome aboard, ma'am. Welcome to Titanic.It was the ship of dreams...to everyone else.To me. It was a slave ship...taking me back toAmerica in chains.Outwardly, I was everythinga well brought up girl should be.Inside, I was screaming.Jack, you are pazzo.You bet everything we have.When you got nothing,you got nothing to lose.Sven?All right, moment of truth.Someone's life isabout to change.Fabrizio?Niente.Olaf?Nothing.Sven? pair.I'm sorry, Fabrizio.I'm sorry...you're not gonna seeyour mom again for a...Long time...'cause we're going to America.Full house, boys!Come on.I'm going home!I'm going home.I go to America!No, mate.Titanic go to America,in  minutes.Shit.

Wait!Hey, wait!We're passengers!Have you been throughthe inspection queue?Of course.Anyway, we don't have any lice.We're Americans. Both of us.Right.Come aboard.We're the luckiest sonsof bitches in the world.You know that?Goodbye!You know somebody?Of course not.That's not the point.Goodbye! I'll miss you!Goodbye!I will never forget you!Come with me,darling. Let's go.G.G. G.Excuse me, ma'am.G.Oh, right here.Hey, how you doing?Jack. Nice to meet you.Jack Dawson. Nice to meet you.How you doing?Who says you get top bunk?This is your privatepromenade deck, sir.Will you be requiring anything?Excuse me. This one? No.It had a lot of faces on it.This is the one.Would you like all ofthem out, miss?Yes. We need a littlecolor in this room.Put in there. In the wardrobe.God, not those fingerpaintings again.They certainly were awaste of money.The difference betweenCal's taste in art...and mine is that I have some.They're fascinating.Like being inside a dreamor something.There's truth but no logic. What's the artist's name? Something Picasso.Something Picasso.He won't amount to a thing.He won't, trust me. Let's put the Degas in the bedroom. At least they were cheap.Put it in the wardrobe.At Cherbourg, a woman came aboardnamed Margaret Brown.We all called her Molly.History would call herthe Unsinkable Molly Brown.Well, I wasn't about towait all day for you, sonny.Here, if you thinkyou can manage.Her husband had struck goldsomeplace out west.And she was what Mothercalled ""new money.""By the next afternoon...we were steaming westfrom the coast of Ireland...with nothing out aheadof us but ocean.Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.Let's stretch her legs.Yes sir.All ahead full, Mr. Moody.Very good, sir.All ahead full.All ahead full!Come on lads, step lively!All right! Let's stokeher right up!We go full ahead!Come on, put yourbacks into it! knots, sir.Hey, look, look, look!See it?There's another one! See him?Look at that one!Look at him jump!I can see the Statueof Liberty already.Very small, of course.I'm the king of the world!She is the largest moving objectever made by the hand of man...in all history.And our master shipbuilder,Mr. Andrews here...designed her from thekeel plates up.I may have knockedher together, but...the idea was Mr. Ismay's.He envisioned a steamerso grand in scale...and so luxurious in...its appointments...that its supremacywould never be challenged.And here she is. Willed into solid reality. Hear, hear.I'll have the salmon.You know I don'tlike that, Rose.She knows.We'll both have the lamb.Rare, with verylittle mint sauce.You like lamb, right sweet pea?You gonna cut her meatfor her too there, Cal?Hey, who thought ofthe name Titanic?Was it you, Bruce?Yes, actually.I wanted to convey sheer size.And size means stability...luxury, and aboveall, strength.Do you know ofDr. Freud, Mr. Ismay?His ideas about the male preoccupation withsize might be of particular interest to you.What's gotten into you?Excuse me.I do apologize.She's a pistol, Cal.Hope you can handle her.Well, I may have to start minding what shereads from now on, won't I, Mrs. Brown?Freud? Who is he?Is he a passenger?The ship is nice?Yeah. It's an Irish ship.Is English, no?No, it was built in Ireland., Irishmenbuilt this ship.Solid as a rock.Big Irish hands.That's typical.Firstclass dogscome down here to take a shite.Lets us know where we rankin the scheme of things.Like we could forget?I'm Tommy Ryan. Jack Dawson. Fabrizio.Do you make any moneywith your drawings?Forget it, boyo.You'd as like have angels fly out ofyour arse as get next to...the likes of her.I saw my whole lifeas if I'd already lived it.An endless paradeof parties and cotillions...yachts and polo matches.Always the same narrow people,the same mindless chatter.I felt like I was standingat a great precipice...with no one to pull me back.No one who cared...or even noticed.Don't do it.Stay back.Don't come any closer.Come on.Just give me your hand.I'll pull you back over.No! Stay where you are.I mean it.I'll let go.No, you won't.What do you mean, no I won't?Don't presume to tell mewhat I will and will not do.You don't know me.Well, you would have done it already.You're distracting me. Go away.I can't.I'm involved now.You let go, and I'm going to haveto jump in there after you.Don't be absurd. You'll be killed. I'm a good swimmer.The fall alone will kill you.It would hurt. I'm notsaying it wouldn't.Tell you the truth...I'm a lot more concernedabout that water being so cold.How cold?Freezing.Maybe a couple degrees over.You ever...ever been to Wisconsin?What?Well, they have some ofthe coldest winters around.I grew up there,near Chippewa Falls.I remember when I was a kid,me and my father, we went ice fishing...out on Lake Wissota.Ice fishing is, you know, where you...I know what ice fishing is!Sorry.You just seem like, you know,kind of an indoor girl.Anyway, I...fell through some thin ice.And I'm telling you...water that cold,like right down there...it hits you like  knivesstabbing you all over your body.You can't breathe.You can't think. Least not aboutanything but the pain.Which is why I'm not lookingforward to jumping in there after you.Like I said...I don't have a choice.I guess I'm kind of hoping you'llcome back over the rail and...and get me off the hook here.You're crazy.That's what everybody says but...with all due respect, miss...I'm not the one hanging offthe back of a ship here.Come on.Come on, give me your hand.You don't want to do this.I'm Jack Dawson.Rose DeWitt Bukater.I'll have to get you towrite that one down.Come on.I got you.Come on.Help, please!Help! Please, help me! Listen. Listen to me.Listen. Listen to me.I've got you. I won't let go.Now pull yourself up. Come on!Come on.That's right.You can do it.I got you.What's all this?You stand back and...don't move an inch!Fetch the Master at Arms.This is completely unacceptable!What made you think that you couldput your hands on my fiancée?!Look at me, you filth!Cal.What do you thinkyou were doing?Cal, stop. It was an accident.An accident?It was.Stupid, really.I was leaning over and I slipped.I was leaning far overto see the...The... Propellers? Propellers, and I slipped.And I would have goneoverboard but Mr. Dawson here...saved me. And almostwent over himself.You wanted to see the...She wanted to see the propellers.Like I said, women andmachinery do not mix.Was that the way of it?Yeah. Yeah, thatwas pretty much it.Well, the boy's a hero then.Good for you, son. Well done.So, it's all's well and backto our brandy, eh?Look at you. You must be freezing.Let's get you inside.Perhaps a little somethingfor the boy?Of course.Mr. Lovejoy,I think a  should do it.Is that the going ratefor saving the woman you love?Rose is displeased.What to do?I know.Perhaps you could join us fordinner tomorrow evening...to regale our group...with your heroic tale.Sure. Count me in.Good. It's settled then.This should be interesting.Can I bum a smoke?You'll want to tie those.It's interesting...the young lady slippedso suddenly...and you still had time to removeyour jacket and your shoes.I know you've been melancholy.I don't pretend to know why.I intended to save this...until the engagementgala next week...but, I thought...tonight.Good gracious.Perhaps as a reminderof my feelings for you. Is it a... Diamond. Yes. carats to be exact.It was worn by Louis XVI.And they calledit Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. The Heart of the Ocean. Yes.It's overwhelming.Well, it's for royalty.We are royalty, Rose.You know, there'snothing I couldn't give you.There's nothing I'd deny you...if you would not deny me.Open your heart to me, Rose.Well, I've been on my own sinceI was , since my folks died.And I had no brothers or sisters orclose kin in that part of the country...so I lit on out of there and Ihaven't been back since.You could just call me atumbleweed blowing in the wind.Well, Rose, we've walked about a milearound this boat deck and...chewed over how great the weather'sbeen and how I grew up...but I reckon that's not whyyou came to talk to me, is it? Mr. Dawson, I... Jack.Jack.I want to thank youfor what you did.Not just for pulling me back,but for your discretion.You're welcome.Look.I know what youmust be thinking.Poor little rich girl.What does she know about misery?No.No, that's not what I was thinking.What I was thinking was...what could have happened to this girlto make her think she had no way out?Well I...It was everything.It was my whole world and...all the people in it.And the inertia of my life,plunging ahead and me...powerless to stop it.God, look at that thing.You would have gonestraight to the bottom. invitations have gone out.All of Philadelphia society will be there.And all the while I feel I'm...standing in the middleof a crowded room...screaming at thetop of my lungs...and no one even looks up.Do you love him?Pardon me?Do you love him?You're being very rude. Youshouldn't be asking me this.Well, it's a simple question.Do you love the guy or not?This is not a suitable conversation.Why can't you justanswer the question?This is absurd.You don't know meand I don't know you...and we are not having thisconversation at all. You are rude...and uncouth and presumptuousand I am leaving now...Jack. Mr. Dawson.It's been a pleasure.I sought you out to thank youand now I have thanked you.And you've insulted me.Well, you deserved it. Right. Right.I thought you were leaving.I am.You are so annoying.Wait.I don't have to leave. This ismy part of the ship. You leave.Well, well, well.Now who's being rude?What is this stupid thingyou're carrying around?So, what are you,an artist or something?These are rather good.They're very good, actually.Jack, this is exquisite work.They didn't think toomuch of them in old Paree.Paris?You do get around for a p...Well, a... aperson of limited means.Go on. A poor guy. You can say it.Well, well, well.And these were drawn from life?Well, that's one of thegood things about Paris.Lots of girls are willingto take their clothes off.You liked this woman.You used her several times.Well.She had beautifulhands, you see?I think you must havehad a love affair with her.No, no, no.Just with her hands.She was aonelegged prostitute.See?She had a goodsense of humor though.Oh, and this lady...She used to sit at this bar every night...wearing every pieceof jewelry she owned...just waiting forher long, lost love.We called her Madame Bijoux.See, her clothes are all motheaten.Well, you have a gift, Jack.You do.You see people.I see you.And?You wouldn't have jumped.But the purpose of universityis to find a suitable husband.Rose has already done that.Look, here comes thatvulgar Brown woman.Quickly, get up beforeshe sits with us.Hello, girls. I was hopingI'd catch you at tea.We're awfully sorry,you missed it.The Countess and I were justoff to take the air on the boat deck.What a lovely idea.I need to catch up on my gossip.Countess.So, you've not yet lit thelast four boilers?No, I don't see the need.We are making excellent time.The press knows the size of Titanic.Now, I want them to marvel at her speed.We must give themsomething new to print.This maiden voyageof Titanic must...make headlines.Mr. Ismay, I would prefernot to push the engines...until they've been properly run in.Of course I'm just a passenger.I leave it to your good officesto decide what's best.But what a glorious endto your final crossing...if we were to get into New Yorkon Tuesday night...and surprise them all.Make the morning papers.Retire with a bang, eh, E. J?Good man.After that, I workedon a squid boat in Monterey...then I went to Los Angeles to the...Santa Monica pierand did portraits for  cents each.Why can't I be like you?Just head out for the horizonwhenever I feel like it.Say we'll go theresometime, to that pier...only if we just talk about it.No, we'll do it. We'll drink cheap beer.Ride on the roller coastertill we throw up.We'll ride horses on thebeach, in the surf.But you have to do it like a real cowboy.No sidesaddle stuff.You mean with one leg on each side?Can you show me?Sure, if you like.Teach me to ride like a man.Chew tobacco like a man.And spit like a man.You didn't learn in finishing school?No.Come on, I'll show you.I'll show you how.Jack! No, Jack, no. Wait.I couldn't possibly, Jack.Watch closely.That's disgusting.Your turn.That was pitiful.You really have to hawk it back.Get some leverage.Use your arms. Arc your neck.You see the range on that thing?Okay, go.That was better. You have to work on it.Really try to hawk it up.Mother.May I introduce Jack Dawson?Charmed, I'm sure.The others were gracious and curiousabout the man who'd saved my life.But my mother looked at him like an insect.A dangerous insectwhich must be squashed quickly.Sounds like you're a good manto have around in a sticky spot.Why do they always insist on announcingdinner like a damn cavalry charge?Shall we go dress, Mother?See you at dinner, Jack.Son?Son!Do you have any idea what you're doing?Not really.You're about to go into the snake pit.What are you going to wear?I figured. Come on.I was right. You and my sonare just about the same size.Pretty close.You shine up like a new penny.Good evening, sir.Thousands of tons of Hockley steelare in this ship. Which part? All the right ones.Then you're accountableif there's a problem. Where's Rose?She'll be along.There is the Countess.I saw that in a nickelodeonand always wanted to do it.Darling...surely you remember Mr. Dawson.It's amazing.You could almost pass for a gentleman.Almost.This is extraordinary.This is a remarkable voyage. Mad. Completely lunatic.There's the Countess of Rothes.That's John Jacob Astor...the richest man on board.His little wifey, Madeleine,is my age and in a delicate condition.See how she tries to hide it.Quite the scandal.Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress,Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim...is at home with the children, of course.And over here...Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady DuffGordon.She designs naughty lingerie,among her many talents.Very popular with the royals.Congratulations. She's splendid.Why, thank you.Escort a lady to dinner?Certainly.Sweet pea, sweet pea.Ain't nothing to it.They love money. Pretend like you owna gold mine and you're in the club.Hey, Astor.Hello, Molly. Nice to see you.J.J., Madeleine,I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.Well, Jack...are you of the Boston Dawsons?No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.Oh, yes.He must have been nervous.But he never faltered.They assumed he was one of them.Heir to a rail road fortune, perhaps.New money, obviously,but still a member of the club.Mother. Of course.Could always be counted upon.Tell us of the accommodations in steerage,Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good.The best I've seen, ma'am. Hardly any rats.Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class.He was of help to my fiancée last night.It happens Mr. Dawsonis quite a fine artist.He showed me some of his work today.Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.Not to impugn your work, sir.Are all these mine?Start from the outside and work in.He knows every rivet in her.Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews.Thank you, Rose.How do you take your caviar, sir?No caviar for me, thanks.Never did like it much.Where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?Right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.After that, I'm on God's good humor.How do you have means to travel?I work my way from place to place.Tramp steamers and such.I won my ticket on Titanicat a lucky hand at poker.A very lucky hand.All life is a game of luck.A real man makes his own luck.Right, Dawson?And you findthat sort of rootless existence appealing?Yes, ma'am, I do.I've got everything I needright here with me.I have air in my lungsand blank sheets of paper.I love waking up, not knowingwhat will happen or who I'll meet.Where I'll wind up.One night I'm sleeping under a bridge...now I'm on the grandest shipin the world, with you fine people.I'll take more of that.Life's a gift. I don'tintend on wasting it.You never know what hand you'll get dealt.You take life as it comes at you.Here, Cal.Make each day count.Well said, Jack.Hear, hear.To making it count.Bravo.But Mr. Brown didn't knowI'd hidden the money in the stove.He comes home drunk as a pig celebratingand lights a fire.Next is brandy in the smoking room.Join me in a brandy, gentlemen?Now they retreat to congratulate eachother on being masters of the universe.Ladies, thank you for your company.May I escort you to the cabin?No, I'll stay here.Here, Molly.Joining us, Dawson?You don't want to stay with the women.No, thanks. I have to head back.That's best. It'll be all business and politics.Wouldn't interest you.But Dawson, good of you to come.Must you go?Time for me to row with the other slaves.Good night, Rose.Want to go to a real party?Is okay I put my hand here?I can't understand you.I'm going to dance with her now.Come on.Come on. Come with me.Jack. Jack, wait.I can't do this.We'll have to get a bit closer.Like this.You're still my best girl, Cora. I don't know the steps. Me, either. Just go with it.Don't think.Wait! Jack! Wait! Stop, Jack!What? Wait!Jack, no.Beyond the jurisdictionof the Sherman Act.That's what Rockefeller said...Supreme Court didn't swallow it.What? You thinka firstclass girl can't drink?Get out of here.Are you all right?I'm fine.Two out of three.So...you think you're tough?Let's see you do this.Hold this for me, Jack. Hold it up.Jesus!You okay?I haven't done that in years.Come on, lads. Give it all you got.Let's go.Coffee, sir?You didn't come to me last night.I was tired.Your exertions below deckwere no doubt exhausting.I see you hadthat undertaker of a manservant follow me.You will never behave like that again.I'm not one of your mill foremenwho you can command.I'm your fiancée.My fiancée. My fiancée!Yes, you are!

That's right.Okay, now let it go. It was good, wasn't it? Quite nice. That's excellent.Mr. Andrews... Forgive me.I did the sum in my head...and with the number of lifeboatstimes the capacity you mentioned...Forgive me, but it seems that there arenot enough for everyone aboard.About half, actually.Rose, you miss nothing, do you?In fact, I put in these newtype davits...which can take an extra rowof boats inside this one.But it was thought, by some...the deck would looktoo cluttered.So, I was overruled.It's a waste of deck spaceas it is on an unsinkable ship.Sleep soundly, young Rose.I have built you a good ship,strong and true.She's all the lifeboatyou need.Just keep heading aft. The nextstop will be the engine room.Jack, this is impossible.I can't see you. I need to talk to you. No, Jack. No.Jack. I'm engaged.I'm marrying Cal.I love Cal.Rose...you're no picnic. All right?You're a spoiled little brat even.But under that, you're themost amazingly, astounding...wonderful girl...woman, that I've ever known.Jack, I...No, let me try and getthis out. You're ama...I'm not an idiot.I know how the world works.I've got ten bucksin my pocket.I have nothing to offeryou and I know that.I understand.But I'm too involved now.You jump, I jump. Remember?I can't turn away withoutknowing you'll be all right.That's all that I want.Well, I'm fine.I'll be fine. Really.Really?I don't think so.They've got you trapped, Rose.And you're gonna die if youdon't break free.Maybe not right away...because you're strong...but sooner or later thatfire that I love about you, Rose...that fire is gonna burn out.It's not up to youto save me, Jack.You're right.Only you can do that.I'm going back.Leave me alone.Tell Lucile about the disasteryou had with the stationers.Well, of course the invitationshad to be sent back, twice.Oh, my dear.And the dreadfulbridesmaids' gowns.Let me tell you what anodyssey that has been.Rose decided shewanted lavender.She knows I detest the color.So, she did it only to spite me.If only you'd come tome sooner.Ruth saw some of my designs inLa Mode Illustrée.They were for the trousseau of the Duchessof Marlborough's youngest daughter.They were quite charming.But, I think you'll agree,my dear, that together...we've created somethingof a phoenix from the ashes.Hello, Jack.I changed my mind.They said you might be up here.Give me your hand.Now close your eyes.Go on.Now, step up.Now, hold onto the railing.Keep your eyes closed.Don't peek.I'm not.Now, step up onto the rail.Hold on.

Will this light do? What?Don't artists need good light?That is true, but I'm notused to working in...such horrible conditions.Monet! Do you know his work? Of course.Look at his use of color here.Isn't he great?I know. It's extraordinary.Cal insists on cartingthis hideous thing everywhere.Should we be expecting himany time soon?Not as long as the cigarsand brandy hold out.That's nice.What is it, a sapphire?A diamond.A very rare diamond.Jack, I want you to draw melike one of your French girls.Wearing this.All right.Wearing only this.The last thing I need is another pictureof me looking like a porcelain doll.As a paying customer...I expect to get what I want.Over on the bed... the couch.Come.
