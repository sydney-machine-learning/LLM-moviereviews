Avatar,tt0499549,2010,Oscar,"When I was lying there in the VA hospital,with a big holeblown through the middle of my life,I started having these dreams of flying.I was free.Sooner or later, though,you always have to wake up.In cryo, you don't dream at all.It doesn't feel like six years.More like a fifth of teguilaand an asskicking.Tommy was the scientist, not me.He was the one who wanted to get shotlightyears out in spaceto find the answers.Are we there yet?Yeah, we're there, sunshine.We're there.It's about your brother.So, a weekbefore Tommy's gonna ship out,a guy with a gun ends his journeyfor the paper in his wallet.You've been in cryo for five years,nine months and  days.You will be hungry. You will be weak.If you feel nausea, please use the sacks…Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.Me, I'm just another dumb gruntgoing someplace he's gonna regret.Up ahead was Pandora.You grew up hearing about it,but I never figured I'd be going there.Your brother representeda significant investment.We'd like to talk to youabout taking over his contract.And since your genome is identicalto his, you could step into his shoes,so to speak.It'd be a fresh start on a new world.And the pay is good.Very good.— Exopacks on! Let's go! Exopacks on!— Exopacks on! Let's go!Remember, people, you lose that mask,you're unconscious in  seconds,you're dead in four minutes!Let's nobody be dead today!Looks very bad on my report.Hell's Gate tower,this is TAV  on approach.Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.One life ends,another begins.Harnesses off! Get your packs!— Put it together, let's go! Let's go!— Harnesses off! One minute!When that ramp comes down,go directly into the base. Do not stop!Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!There's no such thing as an exMarine.You may be out,but you never lose the attitude.I told myself I could passany test a man could pass.They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,but not on vet benefits,not in this economy.Let's go, special case!Do not make me wait for you!Well, well, ladies.Look at all this fresh meat!Back on Earth,these guys were Army dogs, Marines,fighting for freedom.Look out, hot rod!But out here they're just hired guns,taking the money,working for the company.Check this out, man.Meals on wheels.Oh, man, that is just wrong.I got two guys free in about  minutes!Got it! Need them !You're not in Kansas anymore.You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.Respect that factevery second of every day.If there is a hell,you might want to go there for some R&Rafter a tour on Pandora.Out there, beyond that fence,every living thingthat crawls, flies or squats in the mudwants to kill youand eat your eyes for Jujubes.We have an indigenous populationof humanoids called the Na'vi.They're fond of arrowsdipped in a neurotoxinthat'll stop your heart in one minute.And they have bones reinforcedwith naturally occurring carbon fiber.They are very hard to kill.As head of security,it is my job to keep you alive.I will not succeed.Not with all of you.If you wish to survive,you need to cultivatea strong mental attitude.You've got to obey the rules.Pandora rules.Rule number one…There's nothinglike an oldschool safety briefto put your mind at ease.Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.Wow! You look just like him.Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.I went through avatar training with him.… into the biolab.We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.— Hi.— Hey.Link… Here's the link room right here.This is wherewe're connecting to the avatar.Me and Norm are here to drivethese remotely controlled bodiescalled avatars.And they're grown from human DNAmixed with the DNA of the natives.— Hey. Welcome.— Hey.— Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.— Thanks.Damn! They got big.Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.So the proprioceptive simsseem to work really well.Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.It'll take us a few hoursto get them decanted,but you guys can take them out tomorrow.There's yours.Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.— Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.— Good to meet you, yeah.Looks like him.No, it looks like you.This is your avatar now, Jake.And the concept is that every driveris matched to his own avatar,so that their nervous systems are in tune,or something.Which is why they offered me the gig,because I can link with Tommy's avatar,which is insanely expensive.Is this right?I just say whatever to the video log?Yeah, we gotta get in the habitof documenting everything.You know, what we see, what we feel.— It's all part of the science.— And good science is good observation.Plus it'll help to keep you sanefor the next six years.All right. Whatever.So…Well, here I am,doing science.They're coming out!Attention. Drivers coming out of link.Oh, God.Where's the lab coat?Where's the lab coat?Who's got my goddamn cigarette?Guys! What's wrong with this picture?— Thank you!— Grace Augustine is a legend.She's the head of the Avatar Program.She wrote the book,I mean, literally wrote the bookon Pandoran botany.Well, that's 'cause she likes plantsbetter than people.Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.Grace, I'd like you to meetNorm Spellman and Jake Sully.Norm. I hear good things about you.How's your Na'vi?<font color=»#fcf»>May the All Mother… <font color=»#fcf»>… smile upon our first meeting.<font color=»#fcf»>Not bad . You sound a little formal.<font color=»#fcf»>I studied for five years… <font color=»#fcf»>… butthere is much to learn.— Grace? This is Jake Sully.— Ma'am.Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,and I don't need you. I need your brother.You know, the PhD who trainedfor three years for this mission?He's dead.I know it's a big inconveniencefor everyone.— How much lab training have you had?— I dissected a frog once.You see? You see?I mean, they're just pissing on uswithout even the courtesyof calling it rain.— I'm going to Selfridge.— No, Grace,— I don't think that's a good idea.— No, man, this is such bullshit!I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.He has no businesssticking his nose in my department.Here tomorrow, .Try and use big words.Scorpion TwoHotel, Hell's Gate tower.You are cleared for south departure.Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.— You see that?— Yes, sir.No, you didn't.You were looking at the monitor.I love this putter, Ronnie!I love this putter.Parker, you know,I used to think it was benign neglect,but now I seethat you're intentionally screwing me.Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.I need a researcher.Not some jarhead dropout.Well, actually,I thought we got lucky with him.— Lucky?— Yeah.How is this in any way lucky?Lucky your guy had a twin brother,and lucky that brother wasn'tsome oral hygienist or something.A Marine we can use.I'm assigning himto your team as security escort.The last thing I need is anothertriggerhappy moron out there!Look, look,you're supposed to be winning the heartsand the minds of the natives.Isn't that the whole point ofyour little puppet show?If you look like themand you talk like them,then they'll start trusting us.We build them a school,we teach them English,but after, what, how many years?Relations with the indigenousare only getting worse.Yeah, that tends to happenwhen you use machine guns on them.Right. Come here.I can't… I can't…This is why we're here. Unobtanium.Because this little gray rock sellsfor  million a kilo.That's the only reason.It's what pays for the whole party.It's what pays for your science.Now, those savagesare threatening our whole operation,we're on the brink of war,and you're supposed to be findinga diplomatic solution.So use what you've got,and get me some results.So, how much link time have you logged?— About  hours.— That's good.You're in there.You're here. How much have you logged?Zip. But I read a manual.Tell me you're joking.This is cool.Let's go.Don't. I got this.So you just figured you'd come out here,to the most hostile environmentknown to man,with no training of any kind,and see how it went?What was going through your head?Maybe I was sick of doctorstelling me what I couldn't do.— Biometrics are good.— Link three is ready.Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.Down. Just relaxand let your mind go blank.That shouldn't be hard for you.Kiss the darkest part of my lily white…Initiate link.Run sequence unit three. Go.Launching.I have the first congruency.— That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.— Go figure.Phaselock % .All right. Going in.I'm going in in four.Phaselock % . Link is stable.He's in. Jake, can you hear me?Can you hear me, Jake?Pupillary reflex is good.Pinna response normal.How you feeling, Jake?Hey, guys.Welcome to your new body, Jake.Good!Yeah, we're gonna take thisnice and easy, Jake.— And touch your thumb to your fingers.— Yeah.— Thumb to your fingers.— No problem.That's good.I can see you can remember that one.— Got it.— Well, if you want to sit up,— that's fine.— Okay, good. Just take itnice and slow, Jake. Good.Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?You're wiggling your toes!— Good. Good, Jake.— That's great.Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.Are you feeling any numbness or pain?That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.Take it easy.Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?There's a few more sensorymotor reflex tests we need to run,— so take it easy.— Wait.— Jake.— Sit down, Jake.Jake! Listen to me. Jake!— I need you to sit down. Jake!— It's okay.— Buddy, listen to me.— It's all good. I got this.— Jake, you need to sit down right now.— Guys, get him back on the gurney now.Listen to me.For your own safety, you need to sit down.You need time to adjust to the avatar…Whoa ! Jake!— God, Jake, watch your tail.— Yeah!Sedate! Sedate him ! A thousandmilligrams of Supitocam ! Stat!Guys! Guys! Whoa ! Whoa !By the numbers.— Jake. Come on.— Jake! Listen to me.You're not used to your avatar body.— This is dangerous.— This is great.— Jake? Jake, listen to me.— Come on. They're gonna put you out.— Norm, sit down.— No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.God damn it! Bring them home!— Norm ! Do not leave control!— You're not ready for it!— Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.— So close!I don't even have to play defense on it.Hey, guys. Hey.— It's okay, I'll get him.— Jake, you have to come back!Jake! Jake! Excuse me.— Watch it!— Sorry!Come on!Jake! We're not supposed to be running!— Jeez! Sorry.— Watch it!Hey, Marine!Damn.— Grace?— Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?Think fast.Motor controI's looking good.Come on, everybody, quiet down!All right, gang, lights out.Come on, Louise, chopchop.Hey, hey, hey!Don't play with that, you'll go blind.That's kind of freaky.Come on. Scat.Good night.Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.Welcome back.— You okay? You all right?— Yeah, I'm okay.I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.And this here is my baby.Hold on a second.Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!— We bounce at zeronine.— Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!Vine strike's still loose.You guys are packing some heavy gear.Watch it!Yeah, that's 'cause we're notthe only thing flying around out there.Or the biggest.I'm gonna need you on a door gun.I'm a man short.I thought you'd never ask.There's your man.See you on the flight line.You wanted to see me, Colonel?This low gravity'll make you soft.You get soft,Pandora will shit you out deadwith zero warning.I pulled your record, Corporal.Venezuela, that was some mean bush.Nothing like this here, though.You got some heart, kid,showing up in this neighborhood.I figured it's just another hellhole.I was First Recon myself.A few years ahead of you.Well, maybe more than a few.Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.I come out here?Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?Yeah. They could fix me up,if I rotated back.Yeah, and make me pretty again.But you know what? I kind of like it.It reminds me every daywhat's waiting out there.The Avatar Program is a bad joke.Bunch of limpdick science majors.However, it does present an opportunityboth timely and unique.— Clear!— Clear!A recon gyrene in an avatar body.That's a potent mix.Give me the goose bumps.Such a Marine could providethe intel I need,right on the ground.Right in the hostiles' camp.Look, Sully. I want youto learn these savages from the inside.I want you to gain their trust.I need to knowhow to force their cooperationor hammer them hard if they won't.— Am I still with Augustine?— On paper.Yeah, you walk like one of herscience pukes, you quack like one,but you report to me.Can you do that for me, son?Hell, yeah, sir.Well, all right, then.Son, I take care of my own.You get me what I need,I'll see to it you get your legs backwhen you rotate home.Your real legs.That sounds real good, sir.— Link's ready!— Phaselock % .Just keep your mouth shutand let Norm do the talking.I have five congruencies. Phaselock % .Link three ready.All right, I'm going in.Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.— Norm ! Your pack.— Pack.Stay with the ship.One idiot with a gun is enough.You the man, Doc.Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.So, how will they know we're here?I'm sure they're watching us right now.— Keep moving, Norm.— Keep up, guys!— And here I go.— Scanning.Wow! It's that fast?— Amazing, isn't it?— Yeah.So, that is signal transductionfrom this rootto the root of the tree next to it.So, we should take a sample.Okay. Sample.You know, it's probably electrical,based on the speed of the reaction.Norm, you've contaminatedthe sample with your saliva.Right.So, here I go.Don't shoot.Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.It's already pissed off.Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.It's a territorial threat display.Do not run, or he'll charge.So, what do I do, dance with it?Just hold your ground.Yeah? Come on! What you got?Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.That's right,get your punk ass back to mommy.Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.You keep running.Yeah, and why don't you bring backsome of your friends, huh?Oh, shit.So what about this one?Run? Don't run? What?Run! Definitely run!I'm gonna have to call it, guys.We're not allowed to run night ops.Colonel's orders.I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have tohang on till morning.He won't make it till morning.I don't have all goddamn night.Come on! Come on!Hey, wait. Don't!Great.Look, I know you probably don'tunderstand this,but thank you.Thank you.That was pretty impressive.I would have been screwedif you hadn't come along. It was…Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?Wait up!Just… Hey, slow down.Look, wait up, I just wanted to saythanks for killing those things.— Damn!— Don't thank.You don't thank for this.This is sad. Very sad only.Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.Whatever I did, I am sorry.All this is your fault.They did not need to die.My fault? They attacked me.How am I the bad guy?Your fault!— Your fault!— Easy. Easy.You're like a baby.Making noise, don't know what to do.Easy.Fine. Fine.If you love your little forest friends,why not let them just kill my ass?What's the thinking?— Why save you?— Yeah. Yeah, why save me?You have a strong heart.No fear.But stupid! Ignorant like a child.Well, if I'm like a child, then…Look, maybe you should teach me.Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.Well, then teach me how to See.— No one can teach you to See.— Whoa.Look, come on, can't we talk?Say, where'd you learn to speak English?Dr. Augustine's school?You're like a baby.I need your help.You should not be here.— Okay, take me with you.— No! Go back.No.Go back.No!What…What are they?Seeds of the Sacred Tree.Very pure spirits.What was that all about?Come.Come!Where are we going?Come.What's your name?Shit!Okay.<font color=»#fcf»>Calm people, calm.<font color=»#fcf»>What are you doing, Tsu'tey?<font color=»#fcf»>These demons are forbidden here .<font color=»#fcf»>There has been a sign.<font color=»#fcf»>This is a matter for the Tsahik.<font color=»#fcf»>Bring him.What's going on?Wait.What's happening?Hey!<font color=»#fcf»>Father. … <font color=»#fcf»>… I see you.<font color=»#fcf»>This creature … <font color=»#fcf»>… why do you bring him here?<font color=»#fcf»>I was going to kill him… <font color=»#fcf»>… but there was a sing from Eywa.<font color=»#fcf»>I have said… <font color=»#fcf»>… no dreamwalker will come here .What's he saying?<font color=»#fcf»>His alien smell fills my nose.Hey, what's he saying?My father is deciding whether to kill you.Your father.

I'm no scientist.What are you?I was a Marine. A…A warrior of the Jarhead clan.<font color=»#fcf»>Awarrior!<font color=»#fcf»>I could kill him easily!<font color=»#fcf»>I could kill him easily!No!<font color=»#fcf»>This is the firstwarrior dreamwalker… <font color=»#fcf»>… we have seen.<font color=»#fcf»>We need to learn more about him .<font color=»#fcf»>My Daughter… <font color=»#fcf»>… you will teach him our way… <font color=»#fcf»>… to speak and walk as we do.<font color=»#fcf»>Why me?

You were dug in like a tick.— Is the avatar safe?— Yeah, Doc.And you are not gonna believe where I am.The last thing we see is this Marine's assdisappearing into the brush withthis angry thanator coming after him.— Hey, it's not something you can teach.— That is awesome.You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,the Omaticaya have chosen you.God help us all.«Jarhead clan»?— And it worked?— Hey, I'm practically family.They're gonna study me.I have to learn to be one of them.That's called taking the initiative, son.— I wish I had  more like you.— Look, Sully. Sully.Just find out what the blue monkeys want.You know, I mean, we try to give themmedicine, education, roads.But no, no, no, they like mud.And that wouldn't bother me,it's just that they're…Hey, can you… Can somebody just…Sector .Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop…Rich, stop! That's… Jesus!Their damn village happens to be restingon the richest unobtanium depositwithin  klicks in any direction.I mean, look at all that cheddar!— Well, who gets them to move?— Guess.— What if they won't go?— I'm betting that they will.Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.Killing the indigenous looks bad,but there's one thing that shareholdershate more than bad press,and that's a bad quarterly statement.I didn't make up the rules.So just find me a carrotthat'll get them to move,otherwise it's gonna have to beall stick. Okay?You got three months.That's when the 'dozers get there.Well, we're wasting time.I like this guy.— Guys, right now…— Okay, let's run through them again.Mo'at. Dragon lady.— Eytucan.— Eytukan.

Their goddess,made up of all living things.Everything they know!You'd know thisif you had any training whatsoever.Who's got a datewith the chief's daughter?— Come on. That's…— All right, knock it off, you two.Let's go. Village life starts early.Don't do anything unusually stupid.Easy, boy.Pale is female.Okay. Easy, girl.That is tsaheylu. The bond.Feel her.Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.Feel her strong legs.You may tell her what to do.lnside.For now, say where to go.Forward!— You should go away.— No, you'd miss me.I knew you could speak English.<font color=»#fcf»>This alien will learn nothing… <font color=»#fcf»>… a rock sees more … <font color=»#fcf»>… look at him .Again.lf you want to hit this thing,it's gonna be complicated.Your scan doesn't showthe internal structure.There's an outer row of columns.Real heavy duty.There's a secondary ring here,and an inner ring.There's a core structure like a spiral.That's how they move up and down.We're gonna need accurate scanson every column.Roger that.What else can you tell usabout the structure?I'm guessing this secondary ring,that's also loadbearing.— So where are we going?— Getting out of Dodge.I'm not about to let Selfridgeand Quaritch micromanage this thing.There's a mobile linkup at Site  we can work out of,way up in the mountains.The Hallelujah Mountains?— That's right.— Are you serious?— Yeah.— Yes!The legendary floating mountainsof Pandora. Heard of them?We're getting close.Yeah, look at my instruments.Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.We're VFR from here on.What's VFR?Means you gotta see where you're going.— You can't see anything.— Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?Oh, my God.You should see your faces.Thank you for flying Air Pandora.Welcome to camp.— So, this is my bunk.— This stuff is nasty.— Norm, go under.— All right.— Grace didn't miss a thing.— Trudy, you'll take the top one.She knew I was talking to the Colonel.But I had what she needed,a way back in with the clan,so she's playing nice.All right. Jake, hang a left.You'll be in the link at the end.Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.Holy shit!Do not look in her eye.lkran is not horse.Once tsaheylu is made,ikran will fly with only one hunterin the whole life.To become taronyu, hunter,you must choose your own ikranand he must choose you.— When?— When you are ready.Okay. This is video log .Time's .Do I have to do this now?I really need to get some rack.No, now. When it's fresh.Okay, location, shack,and the days are starting to blur together.The language is a pain, but, you know,I figure it's like fieldstripping a weapon.Just repetition, repetition.— Navi.— '»Nari. '»— Nari.— '»Narrri'»!Narrri!Txur ni'ul. Stronger.Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.This is a very important part of it.— Norm 's attitude has improved lately.— I see you. I see you.But it's not just,«I'm seeing you in front of me,»it's «I see into you. I See you.»It's good he's back on board,but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.«I'm accepting you. I understand you.»So you gotta get this, okay?I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.My feet are getting tougher.I can run farther every day.I have to trust my bodyto know what to do.Yeah! Check it out!Oh, crap!Every day it's reading the trails,the tracks at the waterhole,the tiniest scents and sounds.She's always going on aboutthe flow of energy, the spirits of animals.I really hope this treehugger crapisn't on the final.This isn't just about eyehandcoordination out there, you know.You need to listen to what she says.Try to see the forest through her eyes.Excuse me. This is my video log here.With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.You gotta be kidding me.I talked Mo'at intoletting Grace into the village.<font color=»#fcf»>Look how big you are.It's the first timesince her school was closed down.<font color=»#fcf»>You areso pretty .No, you don't. Come back here.Bon appe'tit.Come on, Marine.I'm trying to understandthis deep connectionthe people have to the forest.She talks about a network of energythat flows through all living things.She says all energy is only borrowed,and one day you have to give it back.<font color=»#fcf»>I see you… <font color=»#fcf»>… Brother<font color=»#fcf»>… and thank you.<font color=»#fcf»>Your spirit goes with Eywa.<font color=»#fcf»>Your body stays behind… <font color=»#fcf»>… to become part of The People.A clean kill.You are ready.Learning to ride an ikran,we call them banshees,is the test every young hunter has to pass.But to do that,you gotta go where the banshees are.Oorah.Now what?Jakesully will go first.Now you choose your ikran.This you must feel inside.lf he also chooses you,move quick like I showed.You will have one chance, Jake.How will I know if he chooses me?He will try to kill you.Outstanding.Let's dance.<font color=»#fcf»>That moron's going to die.<font color=»#fcf»>Don't be afraid, warrior.Make the bond!No!Jake!Tsaheylu, Jake.Tsaheylu!Stop!Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?First flight seals the bond.You cannot wait.— Think, «Fly! ""— Fly?God damn!Oh, shit!Shut up and fly straight!That's it. Bank left!Level out! That's it.Jakesully!Hey!Let's go!Yeah, baby, I got this!Oh, shit!I may not be much of a horse guy,but I was born to do this.Yeah!— I came like this. This you.— Yeah, yeah.— I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.— Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard…The Tree of Souls.It's their most sacred place.See the Flux Vortexin these false color images?Yeah, that's what messes upmy instruments.There is something really interestinggoing on in there biologically.I would die to get samples.Outsiders are strictly forbidden.You lucky swine.I was a stonecold aerial hunter.Death from above.Only problem is, you're not the only one.Dive!Go, go!Follow me!Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.It is Toruk. Last Shadow.Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.My grandfather's grandfatherwas Toruk Macto.Rider of Last Shadow.He rode this?Toruk chose him.It has only happened five timessince the time of the First Songs.— That's a long time.— Yes.Toruk Macto was mighty.He brought the clans togetherin a time of great sorrow.All Na'vi people know the story.Everything is backwards now.Like out there is the true worldand in here is the dream.It's hard to believeit's only been three months.I can barely remember my old life.I don't know who I am anymore.Haven't gotten lost in the woods,have you?Your last report wasmore than two weeks ago.I'm starting to doubt your resolve!The way I see it,it's time to terminate the mission.No, I can do this.You already have.You give me good, usable intel.This Tree of Souls place.Yeah, I got them by the balls with thatwhen this turns into a shit fight,which it will. Yeah.Now it's time to come in.By the way,you gonna get your legs back.Yeah. I got your corporate approval.It's a done deal.Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.I'm a man of my word.I gotta finish this.There's one more thing.Ceremony. It's the final stageof becoming a man.lf I do it, I'm one of them.And they'll trust me.And I can negotiatethe terms of their relocation.Well, then,you'd better get it done, Corporal.The Na 'vi saythat every person is born twice.The second time is when you earnyour place among The People forever.<font color=»#fcf»>You are now a son of the Omaticaya.<font color=»#fcf»>You are part of The People.Come. Come.This is a place for prayers to be heard.And sometimes answered.We call these trees Utraya Mokri.The Tree of Voices.The voices of our ancestors.I can hear them.They live, Jake,within Eywa.You are Omaticaya now.You may make your bowfrom the wood of Hometree.And you may choose a woman.We have many fine women.Ninat is the best singer.But I don't want Ninat.Peyral is a good hunter.Yeah, she is a good hunter.I've already chosen.But this woman must also choose me.She already has.I am with you now, Jake.We are mated for life.What the hell are you doing, Jake?Ma Jake!Don't forget your phase integration.— Jake!— No, no, the middle button.— You gotta eat something.— Yeah, there you go.Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!Don't make me forcefeed a cripple.Grace, I don't want… Hey!Jake!Okay.Here. I'm done.

Stop!— Jake!— Go back, stop!Hey, boss.Hey!— What?— I got a nativedoing the funky chicken here.He's blocking my blade.Well, keep going. He'll move.These people have to learnthat we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.Stop! Hey!Go! Go!There, see? He moved.Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!I'm blind.— Jake!— Neytiri!Here, come on!Freeze it right there.Scale up. Enhance.Son of a bitch.Unbelievable.— Get me a pilot.— Yes, sir.<font color=»#fcf»>Tsu'tey will lead the war party.<font color=»#fcf»>Stop please!<font color=»#fcf»>This will only make it worse.You do not speak here!<font color=»#fcf»>We will strike them in the heart.Tsu'tey! Don't do this.— You!— Listen. Brother…— You mated with this woman?— Oh, shit.Is this true?We are mated before Eywa. It is done.Brother, please.Do not attack the Sky People.Many Omaticaya will die if you do.You are not my brother!And I am not your enemy!The enemy is out there,and they are very powerful!Go! Go! Go!— I can talk to them.— No more talk.Tsu'tey!I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.And I have the right to speak.<font color=»#fcf»>I have something to say… <font color=»#fcf»>… to all of you.The words are like stones in my heart.Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!You can't interrupt a link in progress!It's very dangerous!Grace!Oh, no.— Wait!— Stay down, sir.Okay. Look…I was sent here to…<font color=»#fcf»>You see?<font color=»#fcf»>It is a demon in a false body.— Are you out of your goddamn mind?— You crossed the line.Wheel this meat out of here.Jake! What the hell is going on here?You let me down, son.So, what,you find yourself some local tailand you just completely forgetwhat team you're playing for?Parker, there is timeto salvage the situation.— Parker…— Shut your pie hole!Or what, Ranger Rick?You gonna shoot me?— I could do that.— You need to muzzle your dog.Yeah, can we just take this downa couple of notches, please?You say you want tokeep your people alive?You start by listening to her.Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya— in a way you can't imagine.— You know what?You throw a stick in the air around here,it's gonna land on some sacred fern,— for Christ's sake!— I'm not talkingabout some kind of pagan voodoo here.I'm talking about something real,something measurablein the biology of the forest.Which is what, exactly?What we think we knowis that there is some kind ofelectrochemical communicationbetween the roots of the trees,like the synapses between neurons.And each tree has tentothefourthconnections to the trees around it.And there are tentothetwelfth treeson Pandora.Which is a lot, I'm guessing.It's more connectionsthan the human brain.Get it? It's a network.It's a global network,and the Na'vi can access it.They can upload and download data.Memories.At sites like the one you just destroyed.Yes!What the hell have you peoplebeen smoking out there?They're just goddamn trees!— You need to wake up, Parker.— No. You need to wake up.The wealth of this world isn'tin the ground. It's all around us.The Na'vi know that,and they are fighting to defend it.lf you want to share this world with them,you need to understand them.I'd say we understand them just fine,thanks to Jake here.Hey, Doc, come take a look.They're not gonna give up their home.They're not gonna make a deal.For what? Lite beer?And blue jeans?There's nothing that we havethat they want.Everything they sent me out here to dois a waste of time.They're never gonna leave Hometree.So, since a deal can't be made,I guess things get real simple.Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.I might just give you a big wet kiss.I'll do it with minimal casualtiesto the indigenous.I'll drive them out with gas first.It'll be humane.More or less.All right, let's pull the trigger.— Come on, people.— Oh, man.Let's pack it up, let's go.This is how it's done.When people are sittingon shit that you want,you make them your enemy.Then you're justified in taking it.Quaritch is rolling the gunships.He's gonna hit Hometree.My God.— Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!— Back off!Parker. Wait. Stop.These are people you're about to…— No. No, no, no, no.— I said back off!They're flybitten savagesthat live in a tree!All right?

'Cause that's where we're going.Ouch.You big baby.We're moving.I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.I'm a scientist, remember?I don't believe in fairy tales.The People can help you.I know it.Why would they help us?The People say Eywa will provide.With no home, no hope,there was only one place they could go.Link's running.— What's the plan here, Jake?— There's no plan.Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.He's not gonna let you near that place.I gotta try.Launching.Outcast.Betrayer.Alien.I was in the place the eye does not see.I needed their help, and they needed mine.But to ever face them again,I was gonna have to take itto a whole new level.Sometimes your whole life boils downto one insane move.There's something we gotta do.You're not gonna like it.The way I had it figured,Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.Nothing attacks him.Easy, boy.So why would he ever look up?But that was just a theory.Toruk Macto?I See you.I See you.I was afraid, Jake.For my people.I'm not anymore.<font color=»#fcf»>Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo… <font color=»#fcf»>… I stand before you… <font color=»#fcf»>… ready to serve the Omaticaya people.You are Olo'eyktan,and you are a great warrior.I can't do this without you.Toruk Macto,I will fly with you.My friend is dying.Grace is dying.I beg the help of Eywa.Look where we are, Grace.I need to take some samples.The Great Mother may chooseto save all that she isin this body.Is that possible?She must pass through the eye of Eywaand return.But, Jakesully,she is very weak.Hang on, Grace.

Grace, please. Grace!What's happening?What's happening?Grace!Grace!What's happening?Did it work?Her wounds were too great.It was not enough time.She is with Eywa now.With your permission, I will speak now.You would honor me by translating.The Sky People have sent us a messagethat they can take whatever they wantand no one can stop them.Well, we will send them a message.You ride out as fastas the wind can carry you.You tell the other clans to come.You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.And you fly now with me!My brothers! Sisters!And we will show the Sky Peoplethat they cannot take whatever they want,and that this,this is our land!Yah!Yah!Yah!We rode out to the four winds.To the horse clans of the plain.Back to the stars!To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.For our children's children!When Toruk Macto called them, they came.Yah!Everyone on this base, every one of you,is fighting for survival.That's a fact!There's an aboriginal horde out theremassing for an attack.Now, these orbital images tell methat the hostiles' numbershave gone from a few hundredto well over , in one day.And more are pouring in.ln a week's time,there could be , of them.At that point,they will overrun our perimeter.Well, that's not gonna happen!Our only security liesin preemptive attack.We will fight terror with terror.Now, the hostiles believethat this mountain stronghold of theirsis protected by their…Their deity.And when we destroy it,we will blast a craterin their racial memory so deepthat they won't comewithin , klicks of this place ever again.And that, too, is a fact.Yeah! Yeah.Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.They've got these huge palletsof mine explosives.It's for some kindof shockandawe campaign.Fricking daisy cutters!Quaritch has taken over.He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.— When?—  tomorrow.— Max! Max!— I gotta go.We're screwed!And I was hopingfor some sort of tactical planthat didn't involve martyrdom.We're going up against gunshipswith bows and arrows.I have  clans out there.That's over , warriors.Now, we know these mountains.We fly them. You fly them. They don't.Their instruments won't work up here.Missile tracking won't work.They'll have to fire a line of sight.lf they bring the fight to us,then we have the homefield advantage.You know he's gonna commit that bomberstraight to the Tree of Souls.Yeah, I know.lf they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.That's their direct line to Eywa,their ancestors.It'll destroy them.Then I guess we'd better stop him.I'm probably just talkingto a tree right now.But if you're there,I need to give you a headsup.lf Grace is with you,look into her memories.See the world we come from.There's no green there.They killed their Mother.And they're gonna do the same here.More Sky People are gonna come.They're gonna comelike a rain that never ends.Unless we stop them.Look, you chose me for something.I will stand and fight.You know I will.But I need a little help here.Our Great Motherdoes not take sides, Jake.She protects only the balance of life.It was worth a try.Yeah!
