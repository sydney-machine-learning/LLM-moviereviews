Broken Arrow,1950,"Broken ArrowThis is the story of a land......and its people inthe year ......and of a man......whose name was Cochise.He was an Indian......leader of the ChiricahuaApache tribe.I was involved in the story......and what I am telling happenedexactly as you'll see it.The only change will be thatwhen the Apaches speak......they will speak in our language.What took place is part ofthe history of Arizona......and it began for me here,where you see me riding.Since leaving the Army I had beenprospecting for gold off and......one day I heard the colonelat Tucson wanted to see me.The story started when I sawbuzzards circling in the sky.The buzzard's a smart bird.Something......or somebody,was getting ready to die.I figured it was a hurt deeror a rabbit or a snake.Not a rabbit......not a deer.His kind was more dangerousthan a snake.He was an Apache.For ten years we'd been on asavage war with his people......a bloody, nogive, notake war.Drink.Better slow.I could have killed you before.A fire was dangerousin Apache country.But his wounds were bad andhe was running a high fever.He had eight pieces of buckshotin his back and I dug them out.He was in pain but he neverlet out a sound.For the next few days I pannedthe stream for gold......and watched the boy.I wanted to be on the move, andI was glad he was recovering.Do your legs feel stronger today?Little bit.You've still got a limp.Today I must leave.No, I must go. Too soon for you.For my legs, yes,but for my family, no.This is my novice time.I am . So I learn to be a man.I go on trips alone.But I have been away too long.In the wickiup my mother is crying.My father looks for me, I think.I am their only one now.My brother and my sister werekilled at Big Creek.""My mother is crying"", he said.It never struck me that an Apachewoman would cry over her son......like any other woman.""Apaches are wild animals"",we all said.Do you pray to Killer of Enemies?Not even to Life Giver?The ones up there.We have another name.Apaches pray for allwhite men to die.But now I pray to keep you safe.At sunset last night, I threw pollento the four winds for you.Thanks, boy.This is very big......against headache and sickness.Now it is yours.They could have killed.Put away your gun.My people are watching us.They see I am unharmed.This is clear talk.It says they can still kill.This white man is my friend.This white man is my friend.He must not be hurt.When did my son become a tame Apache?Father look! He gave me life againwhen the soldiers wounded me.Where did you meet soldiers?It will shame us to say.An Apache should not do whatothers cannot know.This one... ...he was with them? No.He found me later. He healed me.It will be wrong to harm him.You do no give orders.You speak our tongue?A little.White men pay many dollarsfor the scalp of an Apache.I know.Then why did you not take his scalp?If I kill an Apache it'll notbe for scalp or money.Why not? My people and yourpeople are at war.It is not my way to fight. It is the way of all whites. It is not my way.You are a woman maybe.Apaches do not take scalps either.And they are not women.He hides something.Why are you here in our mountains?I look for gold and silver.For what?For yellow iron.You did not kill.We will not kill this time.But not again.Give him his gun.They wanted to kill me, all right,but they let me go.I learned things that day.Apache mothers criedabout their sons.Apache men had a senseof fair play.Ambush! Run!Two men were killed, and forthe three wounded it was worse.But this was war, and it wascruelty in both sides.On one of the menthey found a pouch......which held three Apache scalps.So they dug a pit and they rubbedhis face with sweet juice......and made me watch the ants come.Learn it......learn it well, this is Apache land.You have no right here.Where Cochise lives,no white man can live.Take your weapons. Go!Let your face not be seen again!Howdy, gents.Hi, Tom. Find yourself a gold mine? No.Howdy, Terry.Just coffee for me. We have smoked turkey today. No, just coffee, thanks.Wipe them all out......but cheer them. Jeffords? Yes, sir.I'm Colonel Bernall.You received my message?That's why I came.What's on you mind?I'm the new chief at Fort Grand.Congratulations.My orders are to clean outCochise and his Apaches.A big order, sir.Wipe them all out.Butcher them like hogs, I say......like hogs.This man was in a party of miners......ambushed yesterday by Apaches.Where was the ambush?Just south of here.They wounded Cochiseand killed  Apaches out of .There weren't  only ,and not a one scratched.How do you know, Jeffords?I watched it.Watched it? Seems to me mostmen would have lent a hand.I was tied.The Apaches got me earlier.You fought your way out?They let me go.I never heard of a thing like thathappening to a white man. Did you, John? No. Did you, Milt? No.I ran across awounded Chiricahua boy.I healed him up. They thoughtthey owed me something. Apaches playing fair? Yes.I don't understand.You mean you found a woundedApache and didn't kill him?That's right.I'd like to ask you why?What do you want from me, Colonel?Jeffords......I think I know howwe can stop Cochise.I have  men from Pennsylvaniaand New Jersey.They're disciplined troopers. Yes, I've seen them around. I have a good plan.I want information from you andI want you to do reconnoitering.In six months the war will be overand we'll have Cochise hanging.No, you won't, Colonel.Jeffords, I'm an experton open warfare. I have thirty... Cochise can't read a map......but he knows every gulley,every mountain in Arizona.His men and horses can gotwice as far as yours.He can't write his name......but his intelligenceservice knows when......you got to Fort Grant andhow many men you've got.He's stopped theButterfield stage from running......he's stopped the U.S. mailsfrom going through.For the first time he has allthe Apaches under one command.You're not going to stringhim up in six months.Not in six years.Good day, gents. Terry. Jeffords!Will you scout for me? You can find somebody else. Maybe......Captain Jeffords became toofriendly with the Apaches.Maybe he doesn't knowwhat side he's on.Easy, gents.I'm not looking for trouble butif you don't fight them......you're with them.I've got to say that.Who says so? What's your name?Ben Slade. I own a ranch onlya mile out from Fort Grant.The Apaches burned myhouse last month.My wife was inside.They almost got my boy too.A white man should hate that.Right. Anybody would.Why don't you jointhe Colonel's staff? That's private business, Slade. War ain't private business......when they kill women and kids.At Big Creek we killedIndian women and kids.Cochise started this and any...Hold on! Let's just getthe facts straight here.Cochise didn't start this war.A snooty little lieutenantfresh out of the east started it.He flew a flag of truce whichCochise honored......then he hanged his brother and......others under the flag.You hear all sorts of stories.You want to know why I didn'tkill that Apache boy?For the same reason I wouldn't killyour boy or scout for the army.I'm sick and tired ofall this killing.And, who asked usout here in first place?I don't know, Tom.I don't say we do right.But we're bringing civilization here.Clothes, carpets, hats,boots, medicine.Why I got a wagonload of whiskey......waiting in the east?I could sell thatif it wasn't for Cochise.It's an ambush!Run!Juan, come on in. Hi, Tom. Hi, Milt.After all this time,one single freight wagon......squeezed through.Cochise didn't show his ugly face.Are you sending your mail riderswith the military?It'd take the Army and Navy.No eastern mail has gone outor come in for seven weeks.The Apaches are shootingmy job right from under me.Maybe there's a way toget your mail through.A new route?Could I use this officeevery afternoon for a while? What for? Juan.Juan, I've got work for you.I want to hire you formaybe almost a moon.I want you to teach meto speak Apache good.I want to learn about Apache spirits.I want to learn about the Apache ways.Apache in here.No white man asks to learnthese things. Why do you?I want to speak to Cochise.Are you crazy, Tom?Milt, I'm sick and tiredof being in the middle.I'm tired of people like Lowrie,Terry, and you......asking my position.I've been willing to gointo Cochise's territory......to look for gold.I've risked before.Cochise will not speakwith white men.We'll send up smoke signals.He will not come to see you.No, I want to go and see him. To his stronghold? That's right.No white man's seenCochise in ten years... ...and lived to tell it. Once you could talk to him.Don't try it, Tom.The ants will eat your eyes.That could happen any time.Like the other day.Juan, will you teach me?I want to tell Cochise tolet the mail go through.Maybe even about peace.Yes......I will teach you, and for thisI will not take any dollars.But I think it will end bad.I think Cochise will kill you.Milt, can we use the office?It's your eyes.Good enough. Apache eyes quick.This says you come in peace.They will doubt it but it'llmake them want to find out.You've speak our language well.You do not yet thinklike an Apache......but you are close to.Juan, you've been a good guide.If I see Cochise......what grows from our talkswill be from you too.Last night I heard an owl......the worst of all signs.It is not yet too late.Come back with me.They will kill you.I didn't hear the owl, Juan,but thank you anyway.Remember then:...If you see him......do not lie to him.Not in the smallest thing.His eyes will see into your heart.He is greater than other men.I started into the canyons thatled into Cochise's country.I never felt so lonely andfrightened in my life.For three days I climbedhigher towards......the Apache stronghold.On the third day......I was nearing the entranceto the stronghold.Juan had told me what to look for.Cochise had given mepermission to enter.I kept my hands visible......away from my weapons......and I tried to look at ease.It is known that the chiefof Chiricahua Apaches......is the greatest Indian leader.I have come to speak to him aboutthe welfare of his people.It is known he respects truth......as he respects bravery.You will hold these for me?I will want them when I leave.How do you know you willleave here alive?I am Cochise.Speak.When the Indian wishes tosignal his brother......he does so by smoke signs.This is the white man's signal.My brothers far away can look atthis and understand my meaning.We call this mail.The men who carry themail are like the air......that carries theApache smoke signals.They seek no trouble.Yet your warriors kill them.I've come here ask you to letthese men travel in safety.This mail carries warsignals against us.No, this is used for other talk.War signals are sentby the military......by special ways.How?Sometimes by a thingwe call the telegraph.Other times by men like me.You have carried messages against us?When I was a scout forthe military, yes.You have fought us?Yes.In the battle of Apache Pass.Come with me.You are a brave man.Now hear me.I am the leader of my people.They do not betray me andI do not betray them.We fight for out land againstAmericans who try to take it.You give me no reason why I shouldnot kill American mail riders......and kill you too.You were not asked to come here.Mail riders do you no harm.Apaches who did your peopleno harm were hanged.One was my brother.My people have doneyours great wrong.I have always said this.Do you think because I aman Indian I am a fool?You can trick me?I would not have come hereif I thought that.A fool sees only today.Because I respect you andyour people, I think of tomorrow.What about tomorrow?The Apaches are warriorswithout equal.But they are small in number......and tomorrow they'll be smaller.I will not talk of that with you.Is it not possible that yourpeople and mine......can some day live togetherlike brothers?That is strange talkfrom a white man.Your people do not want peace.They have taught me that.This mail can be the first step.I ask you to think on it.Why should not thewhite man act first?Am I better than the white man?A white man has come here.I ask you to think of your people......and look at tomorrow.My mind must work on it.You will rest here tonight.It is my strong wish.Walk with me so they willsee us together......so you will be safe here.What is the meaning of the dance?The Spirits of Good andEvil are dancing.Not everyone can do it.If it's done wrong theywill be angry up there.This must be the dance precedingthe sunrise ceremony for a girl.You know about it?A little bit.Without words it tells me things.You are very different fromother whites, Tall One.You learn to speak our tongue......try to understand our ways.It is good to understandthe ways of others.I respect your people, Cochise.You know what I am thinking?Maybe some day you willkill me or I will kill you......but we will not spiton each other.That is how I feel.The girl inside the wickiup is inthe holiest time of her live.These four days she becomesWhite Painted Lady, Mother of Life.It is good luck to visit her now. Would you like to visit her? Yes.Were you ever wounded?In my arm.We will tell her.For this night only this girl ismore holy than most, maybe......because she has been awayfrom us for a long time.She is very old for this ceremony.It's very special.White Painted Lady......I have old wounds.Yes......but each scar is a markof love for your people.The path of you people isstretched long behind you......and you are the head......and you are the heart......and you are the blood.Killer of Enemies is yourfather and you are his son.You will be well.I have brought someone with me.Then he is welcome.He has an old arm wound.Give me your arm.Does it hurt you?Sometimes.It will never hurt again.Your life will be long.The good things will be yours.The sun will shine for you.What's her name?Sonseeahray.It means Morning Star.Morning Star.This is called shaving.You......see white men have more hair ontheir faces than Indians, so......they cut it of insteadof pulling the hairs out.Maybe you'd like to come closer.Don't be afraid, Sonseeahray.See?I'm not afraid.I thought you were skinning yourself.No. Does it hurt? No.How did you know I was there?I saw you through this.This is much better than lookingin a pool of water.And now I see you.What a thing it is.It's yours to keep.Well......if you had it you couldsee how beautiful you are.Why do you leave? Stay, please.It is not fitting. I......I should have runaway quick before.Why?I am not married.Are you not allowed totalk to Apache men?Old men.Never young men?Only at ceremonies or in the dancing.I thought that Apache boys and girlspick those they wanted.Well, how can they do thatif they do not meet?They meet. There are ways. What ways?They meet by accidentwhere no one sees them.Like my mother couldsee me here with you.I understand.Now I must go. I have workto pick juniper berries.Where?There.I was going to walk upthat way myself......by accident.Sonseeahray.I walk this way because I don'tknow when I may see you again.When do you go?I don't know. Cochise saidhe would talk to me soon. Will you come back? I hope so.I want to. It's important to me.Why?May I speak truly......from my heart?It will be all right.All my life I've been mostly alone.I wanted it that way......but when I saw you in the wickiupand you touched me......and you prayed for me......I felt bad being alone......and I knew that I needed tosee you again before I left......so that I could find out ifit was the same as last night.Is it the same?Yes.So now when I go away......I'll be lonely for someone forthe first time in my life.I have decided about the mail.If I let the riders go in safety,but no one else......there will be no loss.It will show the whiteswhat power the Apache has.It makes me laugh.A good step. The seed is small......maybe the tree will grow big.I'll be happy to tell my people.Is it straight, Captain?You saw Cochise himself?That's right.Any lad who would go intoCochise's camp alone......is some punkin of a man.Or a blasted liar!I believe Captain Jefford's word......but not the word ofand Apache murderer.Cochise said the mailwould ride safe. I believe him.While you were up there with him......his men attacked a wagon trainnear here and killed every one.Another band attacked Kliner's ranchand killed three men and a boy.Cochise never said anythingabout calling off the war.He said the mail was safe.Are you willing to bet onthe word of an Indian?You name it.Will you lay three hundred dollars......that five riders in successionleave here and five come back.You've got a bet.The mail's piled up......and the route's guaranteed safeby Tom Jeffords and Cochise.Three days of riding inthe sunshine at high pay.Who's first?Looks like you'll have togo yourself, Jeffords.Only that won't prove a thing.I'll go.That'll prove something.Duffield's back!It's Duffield.He's back.Good boy!See any Apaches?Saw a few some signals butnot one live Indian.Hi, Milt. It's all right, Tom. Why'd you take so long?When I got there safe I got drunk.Took time to sober up.One made it but there'sstill four more.My bet's safe.You want to double it?After Duffield returned,we sent out a second rider.He saw some Apaches butnothing happened.The third rider, too, said itwas peaceful on the trail.When the fourth rider went outI was really proud of Cochise.The days passed quietly andon one of those quiet days......a wagon train leftMessilla Park for Tucson.Colonel Bernall was in charge.Spectacular country, isn't, General?I wouldn't presume to tell andIndian fighter his business......but we're inviting an ambush.Apaches could be hiding over there.I'm not only inviting ambush,I'm praying for it.Why?You've only got  men.My mule drivers are armed......and I've got  riflemen hidingunder blankets in the wagons.My eyes are getting old.Nahilzay!Halt!Pistol attack!No mister, no!Goklia! Cut them off!They're cutting off the cavalry!Halt!Nahilzay! Pionsenay!The foot soldiers!Seize the wagons!Cut to pieces......fifty dead and a hundred wounded.Colonel Bernall killed......five thousand pounds of grain,every wagon, gun, and mule.How did Cochise know we hadmen hidden in the wagons?He knows what goes on everywhere.Who's the spy? I say, hang him.I can tell you.We all can.Who?Duffield in here?Yeah.What do you want?Your last mail rider's justcome in, safe and sound.Thanks.Yeah......where's Lowrie?You lost your bet, Lowrie.It don't pay to betwith Tom Jeffords.He's a personal friend ofthat murderer, Cochise.It was all a plot.How was it fixed? I got both hands on the bar. How was it fixed?I'm a rancher, not a gunner.Slade. You got friends here.You want to plug me.Cochise don't do favors for nothing. He got something. What? What'd he get?You tell us. Was it guns,or was it whiskey?Anybody else want tocall me a renegade?You are not a renegade, Jeffords.A man's a liar who says you are......but why is Cochiseso partial to you?How does he let themail rider through......on the same day he wipesout a wagon train?Because he's a man of honor.A man of honor?No Indian's a man of honor.The first peace move in ten yearsand you're blind, all of you.We'll have peace when everyApache is hung from a tree!Here's your  dollars, Jeffords.The drinks are on me.I don't drink on any Indian lover.He's a copperhead. He sold us out.String him up!What are we waiting for?Release that man.Release that man. I'm grateful to you, General. I don't want your gratitude.I won't scout Indians foryou or anybody else. I don't want you to. What then?I want you to take me to see Cochise.If anybody can do it, you can.I know you have reason to be angry.But please hear me out.You don't likeArmy officers apparently.Does this also prejudiceyou against me?That depends on how you read it.The Bible I read preaches brotherhood.Suppose their skins aren't white.Are they still God's children?My Bible says nothing aboutthe pigmentation of the skin.There was a Generalserved under Grant......the Christian General.Yes, also BibleReadingHoward.Why do you want to see Cochise?To make a peace treaty with him.Who sent you here?The President of the U.S. With what power? Full power to make a fair treaty.To be changed later.My treaty will stand.I have the President's word.I'll do nothing, General,to betray Cochise.Why all this change ofheart in Washington?President Grant is eager for afair peace with the Apaches. What is a fair peace? Suppose you tell me.Equality.The Apaches are a free people.They have a right to stay free... ...on their own land. The whole southwest?No.No, even Cochise wouldn't askfor that now. He's a realist.But a clear territorythat's Apache......ruled by Apachesthat's what I mean.No soldiers on it.Yes, I'll agree to that. What else?You can talk the restover the Cochise. You'll take me to him alone? Without soldiers? Is that the best way? That's the only way.I'll go alone.I'll see Cochise.I'll get in touch with you.Read your Bible for me too.I like the way you read it.Welcome.Your signals were seen and theyhave been told to Cochise.He is in the other stronghold.He asks you to waitand be comfortable.He will return.I will wait.My feet are tired from tryingto find you by accident.Waiting for you, I......I have washed my hair twiceand my clothes three times.How is this soap made?It comes from yucca root.We grind it up.Sonseeahray......there's something I need to know.I've been away almost a moon.Has anything changed with you?No.When you went away I......I became frightened.I thought......he won't come back......and if he does, when he returnsfrom his own people......he will look at me with cool eyes.But then I......I stopped being afraid......in here.You're trembling.You're not frightened of me?No.Only you put such newfeelings in my heart.I am trembling inside too.Should I hide it?No.Tom!Here they come andhe rides before them.It will be told at our campfires......how the Chiracahuas fought.How the great Cochise led us.A great wagon train destroyed.Their wagons and horses taken.Corn for the whole winter......blankets, guns!In a battle there are losses.Some of our men have gone tolive with their fathers.They were brave.They died honorably.Now for the last time,listen to their names.They will be angry if their namesare ever mentioned again.Ponce.Victorio.Pionsenay and his son Machogee.Naratena.Big Chee.No, thank you.If I make a peace withthis General......can other bigger break it?No, he speaks for the Chief.There's no one bigger. Can I trust them? Will they trust you?My word is my life.I do not break it.I know that. They do not.There can be no peacewithout good will.Try it.All Americans are notlike that lieutenant.You trust me, Cochise.There are Americans that I trust.There are Indians thatI would not trust.Me too.After eating, wipe thehands on the arms.The grease is good for them.Among white men we wash it off.What a waste.My friend, all evening your eyeshave gone to that same maiden.You must understand......any man may be friendly with awoman whose husband is dead......but not with a maidenlike Sonseeahray.Cochise, I...This girl has been asked for already.I think she will be married soon.You have been chosen.It will be an insult not to go.We should not be seen together, Tom.If that is true, why did youchoose me to dance with?I could not help it.With me it's the same.I'll speak to your parents tonight.No, Tom. It will cause deep trouble. You must not. It causes trouble already.You have not acted like my brother.I told you that she is a maiden,and yet you came here.I want her for my wife.I will do all the things expectedof a husband here.I refused Nahilzay once.I will again.I am glad it is the right way......but it will not be easy for you.You are an American.Where will you live? Here?Apaches who have suffered fromwhite men will hate you.Tucson, maybe?Won't the whites hate your wife forof the color of her skin?You will go far away maybe......in new places......but your eyes will see nothing.Always they will beturned backwards......toward home.And you, Sonseeahray......they will look at you asat a strange animal......and make jokes.Hear me, Tall One......I ask you to think on it.Your way will be filledwith bitterness.Think......is it not better tolive with your own?Though you are my friend, Cochise,nothing can change it.I will marry Sonseeahray.What he says does not have to be.You are young. You do not know.With him I do not tremble......even before you.I cannot say more against it.But it won't be easy.Her parents. You will needa strong gobetween.Will you be my gobetween?No other can do it.I will speak for you tonight,otherwise it will be worse.Already everyone knows of this.Your secret was as quietas the thunder.Also I will speak to Nahilzay.He has bad luck. It has happenedbefore to other men.You wait in your wickiup maybe.Walk up and down.It is good for people in love.Well?You have no luck with women.They refused.I'll take her away from here!She'll go with me too.They did not refuse.I make a joke.It is always a good joke.It is all arranged. Three horsesand saddles to the parents.I'll get them in Tucson.No. You will let megive them for you. No. No, I want to.They're almost yours anyway.They come from your people.I want to do this for you.You marry next full moon.Why the delay?Her mother decided. It is her right.Listen now.Go to Tucson.Look into the heart of this general.Bring him back if you believe him.I will send out runners, Apachesfrom all tribes will come here.To talk of peace is a big thing.I cannot decide it alone.My people may not want it.I make no promises.That is not expected.Good sleep, my brother.Remember, no promises.I heard noise.It is not your knife.It is an Apache knife.To attack someone who has beengiven safety here is forbidden.It is a terrible wrong.It cannot be allowed.Nothing's changed.Go to Tucson.Return in ten days.I ask you to forgive me that oneof my people broke my word.Nahilzay.In battle I have had no one like you.Our lives were often mixed.It is ended. You havebetrayed our people.I went back to Tucson andstudied General Howard.Before our return I learned torespect the Christian General.I prayed that a decent peacewould come from this.I wanted it for my country......for Cochise and his people......and I wanted it becauseI loved a girl.I am told it is permitted to visit.For a short time only.My mother is inside the wickiup.You will sit there......and I will keep sitting here......for we must not eventouch our hands.During the days I......I am very busy now. I preparemy clothes for the wedding.I must build a special wickiupfor our honeymoon......away from everybody.Our honeymoon, Tom!I must also build the wickiupwe will live in.In all this my motherhelps me and teaches me......and I try to do as I......I think she did whenshe was a girl.And she couldn't have done it neater.What is that? What does it mean?That's something Americans say.It means that I love you andI'll honor your parents.You understand, Cochise,about the signing of this map.I will place my name upon yours......you will placeyour mark upon mine.What is this signing?This is proof for all people ofany agreement that is made.It is as we agreed yesterday.You will explain it to the others.The peace conference had beengoing on for four days......and we were asked to approachthe meeting place.We finally met the most importantmen of the Apache tribes.They had come from Arizonaand New Mexico......they would decide with Cochisewhether there would be peace.My white brotherwill tell you something.I have in my hand here a map.This is a sort of picture writing.It shows the Apache territory,fifty thousand square miles......that you have agreed upon.This map will go backto Washington......were the Chief of allthe white men lives.If you make a treaty of peace......this will be part of that treaty.If we make peace withthe Americans......can we still raid the Mexicans?There cannot be war againstthe Mexicans either.Let the white eyes...Wait. We will talk ofthis by ourselves.Now is the time only for questions.If the chief of the white mendies, what will follow?His word is a bond onthe chief who follows him.Do others wish to speak?I have a question.Suppose some white man wantsyellow iron and he comes into our land.Can we kill him?He should be captured andgiven to our military.Then he will be judged and punished.What if he resists capture untilhe has killed one of my men?If a white man kills an Indian onyour territory we will hung him.That will be somethingfor Cochise to see.Who else?You will go now.I will bring you our decision.I trust none of it.Four days ago we were givenour territory on a piece of paper.Today we cannot go into Mexico.The American General says no.Already our territory is smaller.Where will we get horses if not bytaking them from the Mexican?The government will give us cattle.We will raise and trade them.The answer of a woman.I am not afraid.I speak from my heart.You speak well.Speak more.Apaches are notgrandmothers to cattle.Cochise now fears battle andis ready to surrender.It is not this false peacewe need but a new chief.Now I say this.The American keep cattle butthey are not soft or weak.Why should not the Apachebe able to learn new ways?It is not easy to change butsometimes it is required.The Americans are growing stronger......while we are growing weaker.If a big wind comes,a tree must bend......or be lifted out by its roots.I will make a test ofit for three moons.I break the arrow.I will try the way of peace.I will give my word to theAmerican General tonight.Those who stay with memust keep my word.Let all others walk away.They are no longer my brothers.If more walk away than stay......then I will no longerbe your chief.I walk away.I walk away.I walk away.I walk away.I walk away.I walk away.Who else comes?Who else comes?Who else?Take your women, your children......your horses, your weapons.Leave our territory.I leave you my name also.Now I am ashamed to be a Chiricahua.I will take the name Mexicanenemies have given me.The Whites will learn it......and you will learn it.From now on......I am Geronimo!If Geronimo or his followers cometo this territory again......let them come with weapons.I am worried.They're taking a long time......too long.I am worried too.This is delicious. What is it?Pony. In you honor, General.Pony? What kind of meat's that?A pony is a small horse, General.We will try this peace.But there must be a waiting time......a time for testing. Three moons.Why is it needed?The white man has not kepta peace in the past. Three month armistice. It's a good idea.The first stone.For every day without warthere will be another.When  moons have passed,the pile will be high.Then we will place a white flagon it and there will be peace.My heart is glad, Cochise.I am not yet glad.To talk a peace is not hard.To live it is very hard.I will wait three moons to be glad.Not everyone was happyabout the treaty.Some still thought Cochisewas a liar and a murderer......and peace impossibleuntil he was dead.But the  days ofthe armistice began.I saw things that neverhappened before.Near Fort Grant......a cavalry patrol passedsome Apaches.They didn't talk......they didn't pretendthey'd become friends.But they didn't shoot.Two days later the first coachin five years left Tucson.I rode with it on my wayback to the Stronghold.Where's that wateryou said we came to?Right down below.That's where I'll leave you.Time to stretch, gents.I can believe a fellowcan ride here......with his liver not turned white.Yeah. A fellow can even think aboutsettling down and getting married.Take cover!What are you shooting at?I saw something move.Save your ammunition!Blast you and that murdering Cochiseboth. We'll be slaughtered.Shut up!Keep down under cover, everybody!Now listen to me.This isn't Cochise.It's a band of renegade Indians.There're a few of themor they'd be rushing us.They're very badly armed too.What they want is our guns.Well, we're pinned here.They're waiting for night.So what do we do?Wait to be butchered in the dark?Shut up!Who's a good shot?I'm not bad. Here.When I yell, you and this fellowstart firing into the hill.Lonergan, you cover the bank.I'm coming upstream. What do you do? Send smoke signals.All right, start shooting!How many rounds you got left?Two.One.Those signal of Jeffordsdid us a lot of good......a lot of good.Listen!Apaches protecting Americans!I lived to see it!Remember to talk aboutit back in Tucson.Twelve days.I think it goes well.There are many good signals.It has gone well for twelve days.I still wait to be glad.Now you will forgetabout peace and war.Think only of your bride.Is the ceremony a long one?No......with us the ceremony oflove takes place here.The rest is small.Let the bride come here.The time has come.Let the groom take hisplace beside her.Your left hand.Your right hand.Kneel down upon the earth.Now your blood mixes.Now for you there is no rain......for one is shelter to the other.Now for you there is no cold......for one is warmth to the other.Now there is no loneliness......now forever,there is no loneliness.There are two bodies but nowthere is but one blood in both.Go now. Ride the white horsesto your secret place.Look.The evening is full and happy for us.We will listen to the brook......all through the night.And listen to the bells.It's as though they aresinging in my heart.Sixteen stones.I know of the attackon the stage coach.It was Geronimo.We trailed him two days buthe crossed into Mexico.You did not follow?We wanted to, but we did not.Good......we will protect all the whitesleaving Tucson and Fort Bowie.Also we will guard Apache Pass.Let the whites break the peace.It must not be Indians......not even bad Indians. You are asleep? No.I'm quiet because I'm happy.I'm afraid if I open my mouth,my happiness will......will rush out in afunny noise like......Yahoo!What does that mean?It is an American word?I think Adam said it when heopened his eyes and saw Eve.Who are they?Don't you know?The world is so big andI know so little.Sometime......will you grow tired of meand go back to your people?That is a bad thought, Sonseeahray.Never think it again.You are my people.Will you tell me that often?Each day of our life togetherI'll tell it to you.I'll always remember themoments of these days.We will remember them together.In the quiet of the nightswe will talk of them a little.We will see our children ridewhite horses, maybe.I can do better myself.By the time he is a grown man,he will know how.What is it?I found this one up the canyon.He had this.I know this boy, Cochise.Hello. You're Ben Slade's boy,aren't you?Yeah, Captain Jeffords. I've beenpraying you'd be up here.Keep calm. No one will hurt you.Did you lose your way?Not exactly.You're the one who said theseApaches wanted peace.It's not peaceful when they steal.What got stolen?Two young colts of mine. Beauties.Swiped night before last by Apaches.I tracked them all day......followed their tracksup the canyon.I ended up out thereat dark last night.Then that redskinjumped me in the morning.None of my people took them.The boy lies.Cochise.I know this boy's fatherhates the Apaches.We have to show that he's wrong.Maybe you have men like Geronimowho would betray you.You speak wisely.I will see these horse signs.All right, bub.We'll mosey down and take a look.See them yet, bub?Right around here, Captain.You call the boy 'bub'.Is it his name?No, it's just to be friendly.Here they are, Captain.Don't shoot till my boygets out of the way.Cochise, they'll kill you. Run!Get Cochise!Run! Sonseeahray, run!The big one is Cochise.Somebody give me a gun.Watch out, son,you stay clear of this.Slade, stay out of line.We can't shoot.He's out of arrows!He got away! It's a bust!Our whole plan's a bust!I'm heading for Mexico.The military will be after us, too.What are you standing there for?Come on.Sonseeahray.Sonsee...No!God!Are you bad hurt?She's dead, Cochise.There is one who still lives.Give me a knife and bring him to me.It will not be done. Bring him to me! No.It will not be done.There are some thingsa man cannot bear.Do you hear me?This peace is a lie!They don't want peace!It is not a lie. I will notlet you make it a lie.Did you think peace would come easy?You, who taught me so well.Is it my brother who asksme to spit on my word?Why do you speak to me?Speak to her!When she hears, I'll hear.You will hear me now!You'll bear this.This was not done by the military.Geronimo broke the peaceno less than these whites.As I bear the murder of my people,so you will bear......the murder of your wife.I am Cochise! I do not betraymy people or their children.No none on my territorywill open war again.Not even you.I have given my permission.They wanted to see you.Tom......we've come to payour respects, Tom.Thank you, Milt.We rounded up ever manconnected with the ambush.They're going to paythe full penalty for what they done.Jeffords......nothing can compensate you forthe terrible thing that happened.But your loss has brought our peopletogether in the will to peace.Without that will, treaties areworth little or nothing.His words meant very little tome then, but as time passed......I came to know that thedeath of Sonseeahray......put a seal upon the peace.From that day on,wherever I went......in cities, among the Apaches,in the mountains......I always remembered......my wife was with me."

I don't know.My work is designed so peoplewill leave me money.This wasn't work.Besides, my dress was torn.I had nothing to wear......so I borrowed somethingspiteful and elegant.Liggett.Weston Ansbury Liggett. Do you know him? Heard of him. He's very social.And very Yale.What's with you and Yale?Always Yale. It's the last college left.

And what is this socalled truth? You find it out yourself. Tell me. It wouldn't be any good.Go out and earn it the wayeverybody else does.The offer is still open.You could come back as a law partnerwith me anytime.I wouldn't jointhe Foreign Legion with you.Pull!Emily.Yes, darling?How's your mother?She's doing well, thank you.She's getting much stronger.When are you coming back to town?Soon as I can.

Her.Three mixedup musketeers.I don't understand.How are you fixed for honesty?Do you know how old I am?Twentyseven.How long have we been,what they call, going together?Three years.And four months.It's a lot of time to put in ona man who can't make up his mind. What are you talking about, marriage? I didn't say that.But it's Gloria or me.Are you telling mewho I can have for friends?I'm only telling you that you can'tkiss me, wishing I were Gloria anymore. That's the stupidest... Call me when you make up your mind.Shall we set a deadline?New Year's Eve?Wait a minute!Let me get this straight.You're handing me an ultimatum?The first ultimatumis always the hardest.Goodbye and good luck.Gloria, don't go like this.My name is Norma.Here's Gloria now.From where?

I'm not like anyone. I'm me. That's right.I shouldn't knock it, should I?You know......last night you were great company.I've spent time around and about.I didn't ask for your creditslast night. I don't need them now. But you're something different. I got the world by the tail.That's what I wanted to talkto you about.What do you want?Just what I'm getting.Oh, now, come on, dollface.You must go to some very bad plays.Okay.Gloria...Now, look......you have a price.We all have, and I can go pretty high.So hold out for all you can get.You may hit it pretty big.On the other hand, if you try fortoo much, you may end up with nothing.Good night.You've got a great act.Go ahead, rub your wrist.I know it hurts.Not if it killed me.I wanna take you in my armsand carry you away.That was a lesson pal,not a treatment.I won't talk about money again.But think.

Happy!Good evening!Good evening. Good evening. Lf it isn't Mr. Liggett.I see you're all filled up.Oh, well, I wouldn't be Happyif I wasn't.We always have roomfor two more weary travelers.If you'll excuse me,I need rest.Oh, sure.I know, I know.Hey, I've got a new joke for you! It's crazy and there's some words... Now, please! But there were these two old maids... Some other time. Later.A man's got to get his rest.He's got to get it regular.Honey, there was a timeI could've worn that coat. Happy was in vaudeville once. In vaudeville? I was vaudeville.You should see my scrapbooks!You're liable to end uppsychologically famous.A case history in a medical book. You writing it? No.But I tell my psychiatrist everything.Even down to the smallest......darkest details.That's a set of notesI'd like to read.But why do you need a psychiatrist?I've never met anyone as directand uninhibited as you.You know that Latin motto,sic transit g/oria?I'm the g/oria, and in my casethe sic is for real sick.I'm not too sure about the transit.I think it's about my car.Gloria...You're wonderful.""Wild"" is the word.First genuine wildnessI've come across in a woman.Have you stopped to thinkthat perhaps......you bring out the wildness in me?With you, who has time to think?Take five. Waitress, some more french fries? Coming up.Gloria, where do we go from here?That's a good question.Why don't we go on a long tripto faraway places......exploring?Exploring what?What else?Each other.Here's the overture.Theme.Where's the theme?I'll get it. You're working. I'll drop by later. No, come on in.We've finished.Sit down.I'll have the last  barsand the tag for you tomorrow. About noon. See you, Steve.Now...I found your message and came over.I wanted to thank youfor the birthday gift.It was ordered a long time ago.They sent it automatically.And a few days early at that.I've missed seeing you. This place is a wreck. I guess so.I've been busy.Here, let me take your coat.Thank you. The story of my life. What is?My simple cloth coat hangingin your closet, next to Gloria's mink. At least mine's paid for. This is not her coat.She borrowed it.I don't know where she is.I've been calling Butterfield .They don't know either. I do. Where?She's way out in another world.Give me my coat.I'll be on my way. You just got here. It was a mistake. Norma. I thought when I found your message......that you'd made up your mind,but you haven't. No, thanks! Norma, sit down. I don't want to.Norma, sit down and listen.Every time we see each other,we fight about Gloria.Without raising our voices......let me explain Gloriato you once and for all.That's quite a job.We grew up in the same area.I've known her all my life.We went to the same school.Her father died when she was little.Her mother went to work.So I sort of became her family.I have to look after her.I'm gonna do it foras long as it takes.Will you try to understand? I understand. I knew you would.I understand that it'smuch worse than I thought.You're in love with her,and you don't even know it.Steve......is she not a tramp? I never liked that word. She's the biggest tramp in the city. I don't like to hear you use it.Suppose you make up your mindto marry me someday?We marry and have kids. Do you wanther hanging around, babysitting?Nipping brandy in the morningand telling them the story......of Red Riding Hood and theThree Lecherous Bears in a hotel?Do we keep a room whereshe can sleep off her hangovers? All I know is, I worry about her. But does she worry about you? Does she?! I don't know or care!This is something I'm gonna dowhether you like it or not!Steve......I withdraw my ultimatum.This fight is far too importantfor me to run away.If I'm going to lose......it's only gonna be becauseI'm thoroughly beaten.If you don't kiss me,I'm going to kiss you.That's where I was born. Right behind that window up there. It's not what I pictured.It isn't what my motherpictured either.We couldn't even afford a doctor.My father delivered me. He must have been a courageous man. He was an inventor.Can you think ofanything more useless......in a small town like this? Not if he invented a way to get out. He did.Oh, with some gimmick or other.And he made money. Not a lot,but enough to set us up comfortably.He was very proud of mewhen I graduated law school.He was certain I'd goa long way in this world.And you did, didn't you? The head of a big chemical company. I'm just another hired hand.The company belongsto my wife's family.My wife is a fact that I can't avoid.She's the center of a spiderwebof family, money......country clubs and timekillingchildish employments.Fall into it once... What will the neighbors think? The worst.You know, that's exactlywhat I'm thinking now.I want to kiss you right here......on Chestnut Street at noonin the worst possible way.You know, I'm gladyou're in chemicals.Annie? Annie. Did you play?Quite a while ago.There!You can't be out of clubs.Well, what did I play?Your heart. And I can hear yourspounding right across the table.I'm sorry, Franny.Let's forget the game.No, no, no. I'll pay attention.Now, let's play.I'd rather you put your troubleson the table.I don't wanna burden you with them.So what am I your friend for?Your money?Or maybe I want to steal your husband?You think I don't know you haven'theard from your daughter in six days?She's never done such a thingbefore without calling.Something terriblemust have happened.Why does it have to be bad?Good things happen too.Frances, you're my best friend, but......I can't talk to you, frankly. Why not?There are things you don't know about.Nobody should. Yes, they should! Her father died when she was so little.If only she'd had a wise father......and strong enough to keep heron the right path!Once, there was a man I almost married.The major.Major Hartley?Somehow or other,Gloria didn't like him.It might have been good for herif I had.Anne.Gloria's a good girl.Don't worry about her.But you always saysuch impolite things to her.I say the same to everybody.I'm a born critic.There's bad in everything,but there's good too.Her good far outweighs the bad.If she was that bad, you wouldn'thave heard from her in six years.Do you mind if I kiss you?You do, and I'll spread an ugly rumorall around the neighborhood.She's a real rust bucket.But she's mine.A yacht! You didn't tell me. It doesn't have any Van Goghs in it......but I do have two originalcopies of P/ayboy magazine.Let's go aboard and ""sail awayfor a year and a day......to the land of the bong trees."" The Ow/ and the Cat.Come aboard, mate, and sign on.But I warn you......the crew hasn't seen a womanfor three months.Crazy.Where are you bound for, captain?Out of frustration......bound for ecstasy.I've heard a lot about ecstasy.It's everything they say......and more.If you'd kindly show me to my quarters,you can lift anchor anytime.Emily?Mother!You should be in bed.And you should not be in bed.At least alone.Now, I can take care of myself.Which seems to be morethan you can do.I want to tell you about our family. It's :, and I know all about... I'll tell you anyway. Sit down.I want to make a point.All right.We've had sacrifice and cowardice......honor and infidelity......courage, love......deception, confusion, brilliance......tragedy. Why not just bring the dictionary?You know what we've never had in thefamily since its history's been recorded?Privacy.There's not one single,solitary divorce.It's my opinion, after  years,we've earned......a divorce with a clear conscience.Tomorrow, I want youto call Mr. Robinson......and instruct him to draw upthe necessary papers......and to have them servedforthwith on that......worthless, absentee husband of yours. He is not worthless. Then why isn't he with you?Mother, you were ill.I wanted to look after you.You wanted to hide fromunpleasantness and the truth.Somewhere, at this very minute, he'sprobably lifting a glass in a bar......or some woman's skirt.And you know it.Oh, Mother, don't be vulgar!Vulgarity has its uses.Anyway, your marriage is over.Divorce him without delay......and start out fresh. No.Never.This is not pride speaking,but because I know Wes is good. And I love him. Oh, nonsense!Now, Mother......you listen to me.If there's anything wrong with Wes,we brought it about.Explain.Instead of my living his life,we brought him here to ours.We handed him a giftwrappedpackage and said:""Here. Here's your life.Don't bother to live it yourself.""You presented him with a meaninglessjob, all title and no work.He woke up with energy to burn,and he started burning it.But in all the wrong directions:Liquor, women, defiance.The more he did it, the morehe had to go on to justify it.You're not running a missionfor lost egos.Mother, I'm running a marriage.Not just through the good days,but through the bad days too.Someday Wes is going to find himself.When he does, I want to be there.In the meantime?All I need is patience.How much have you got left?I don't know, Mother.That's what scares me.I don't know.You're a magnificent woman, Emily.Magnificent.But why don't you fight for him?A knockdown, dragout kind of fight.And give him all the more reasonto run away from me?Emily......where did you ever learnall this wisdom?From you, you fool!That attaché case, a man wouldlove that, wouldn't he?Any man.Especially if the right womangave it to him.I know the right womanand the right man.Let's buy it.Good morning. Good morning. I'd like to see that attaché case. The one in tan. This one? Very nice. Can you giftwrap it? Yes, of course.Would you care to have the initialsput on it in gold?Excuse me. We have a machine that can do it. Fine. Thank you. What initials, please? S.C. S.C. Thank you. S. C?Who's S. C?Steve Carpenter. And who's Steve Carpenter? A friend of mine.Out of nowhere.Completely out of nowherecomes a friend called ""Steve.""It's his birthday.Every birthday, for  years,I've bought him a present.Oh, that's grand.I'm all choked up.Liggett?I'm going to have to leaveyou today and go see Steve.Now, look.I know. ""You'rewith me, kid. Remember?""Lt'll be only a moment, ma'am.Oh, clerk?I'm Gloria Wandrous. I called to seeif something would be ready today. Do you know if it is? I have it right here.Miss Wandrous.Here it is, miss.Thank you. Do you mind? Go right ahead, sir.Gloria......l'm afraid it's your turnto act like a fool because......there's somethingI have to tell you.You act like a man who's expectinghis wife back in town.How did you know? Today?I always knew.Someday.Here I was, tryingto find a way to...Look, Gloria, I have to spendat least tonight with her.A good night's sleep willbe the best thing for you.I have Steve to keep me warm.Don't say things like that.Mr. Liggett, I can hardly waitfor your call tomorrow.You won't forget the number?I'll do my best.And, Liggett......thank you for not calling me......""honey"" and ""babe""and ""dollface"" anymore.I couldn't.I don't think of youlike that anymore.Mama?Darling.I've been so worried about you.I know you have been, darling,and I'm sorry. Are you hungry? No.Mama, I want to tell youwhat I've been doing. No, dear, you don't have to. I do.I've been with a man a whole week.Let me tell you the truthfor once in my life.No, please. Please.We both know what kindof a girl I've been. No, I don't want to hear about it. Mama, you have to!Unless I am honest about yesterday,how can you believe me today?Believe what?I'm different!Mama, I am different.Yesterday, it was men,a whole world full of men...Let me go! You're hurting me!Mama, face it!I was the slut of all time!If only you'd done that before.Long ago......every time I came homeall soaked through with gin.I'm sorry.It's not your fault, Mama.It never has been.It was in me......but it isn't there anymore.It's no longer just men for me.There's only one man. One.Just one.Maybe it's too late for marriage......but it's not too late for love.Now......by some miracle,I'm like everybody else.I'm in love.You can look at me, Mama......without wishingI'd never been born.Hi, Bing.Hi, Ligg.Well?Is that offer still open?Yes or no?So you finally came to your senses.Well, what brought this on?Something just woke me up.I won't ask what it was......because I wish it hadhappened five years ago. You prepared to work hard? Harder than you.We keep regular hours.Law and liquor don't go together.It'll take six monthsof study to catch up.I'll catch up in three.All right, Ligg, old friend.Let's go.She's here, doctor.Good afternoon, Dr. Tredman.I don't know if I care to talkwith you, Miss Wandrous.Then why did you let me in?Don't try to analyze me.You don't have the training.Not in books, perhaps.You missed three sessions in a row,and you're late for this one.I have only so much time a day.If you don't need the time,there are people who desperately do.Now, let's get to workwithout anymore nonsense.I'm sure after all that,we'll have no rapport.But if you get mad enough,I might find something.Doctor Tredman, are youhard of hearing?No. I'm trying to tell you something. What?I don't need you anymore.I have no problems anymore.I'm in love.I am in love.I am really in love.I'm delighted to hear it.Goodbye, Dr. Tredman.Thank you for everything.While it is sometimes possiblethat love can solve many things......love is not so simple that you canrely on it as a complete solution.So......if it isn't all thatyou hoped it would be......if it doesn't work out,don't hesitate to come back......quickly.But it will work out.And I'm gonna make it work.But if it doesn't...But it will.It has to.Happy birthday, Steve!Come on in.Norma's on the phone.Give her my best.Sorry, Norma.Yeah, that place sounds fine.I'll pick you up in a halfhour.What?That was just a studio messenger.See you later. Bye.What are you trying to do to me?Drive you wild with desire!Where have you been all this time?I've been chained to the wall ina sanitarium to keep away from you.Indifference.You can't drive me awaythis time with indifference.Norma's waiting. I gotta...Flesh and blood can only standso much voluptuous torture.You have  seconds, buddyboy.Have you gone on the needle?I am hooked.I am hooked. I'm hooked on you. Cut it out.You have  seconds................The coat!Oh, Lord, the coat!She's coming back to town today! What am I gonna do? ......, ... You're crazier than I am...., ... Bye. Happy birthday!........., , , ...Mrs. Liggett.Welcome home.It's good to have you back. How nice of you, George. How is Mrs. Jescott?She's coming along fine,out of danger.Darling, I didn't evenhear you come in. You been standing there long? A minute.Welcome home.Thank you, Wes.Thank you.I must say, you're lookingsurprisingly youthful.I'm far from being an old man,as yet, I hope.I didn't mean that you ever were old.It's just that......there's a certainaliveness about you.I don't know what I mean.Is your mother feeling better?Yes. Much.Well, that's nice. I'm glad. Emily, there's something... I know. Missing. What? I noticed it as soon as I came in. What are you talking about? My coat. What coat? My mink. Your mink is missing? Didn't you know it was gone?Of course not.See? You must have misplaced it. I checked every closet.Maybe you left it outat Long Island.Just to make certain, I called Mother.But it's not there.How could it be gone?I don't know.I've been here every day......and nobody elsehas been in here but me.None of our friends......nobody.Wes?Have you thought of something?Yes, I was thinking...Yes? You know, those...? What?Those magazine salesmen and peoplewho solicit for charities?I've heard some arefronts for burglaries.You sound like a Park AvenueSherlock Holmes.Go ahead and laugh.Stranger things have happened.The best thing to dois call the police.No!Why not? The cheap publicity and all. Expensive fur isn't cheap publicity.And the insurance companies.If something's stolen, you're labeleda bad risk and your premium goes up.You're ridiculous.I don't understand it.Well, I do!I'll get a private detective.I know a good one.Private detective?This is real life,not a television serial. Mother lost a diamond... Let me do it without your mother.I didn't mean it that way.Which way did you mean it?I don't know.Wes, I'm your wife. I wanna do things your way, even if... Think they're stupid?I'll see you later.Tom......you know Gloria,darkhaired, this high...You don't have to describeGloria to me.I'd know her with my eyesclosed, in a coal mine......during an eclipse. Has she been here tonight? Not for over a week.Let me tell you something.Without her, this place is dead.She's like catnipto every cat in town. Give me a scotch and water. Liggett! Haven't seen you around. Make that a double. How are you? Two brandies.That's right.I've been kind of busy.I heard. That's the businessI wouldn't mind having again. What're you talking about? Come on, Liggett. Come on.Gloria!Sure.She's frantic, isn't she?Like a rocket right off the Earth.Who should know betterthan yours truly?Mother, help me.I'd have left home for that.She's got a traveling itchlike a flea.Hop, hop, hop. One dog to another.She picks you up, and she drops you.Well, welcome to the fraternity.We meet once a year in Yankee Stadium.Now, listen, Butterfield ......l've called her hundreds of times.I'm her closest friend.You've got to tell me where she is.It's a matter of life and death!You're liars.Liars, all of you!Thieves and liars!Now tell me! Do you know the speed limit here? No. miles an hour,posted every halfmile. Do you know how fast you were going? No. miles an hour.Let me see your license, please.Thank you.Turn your face around toward me.Now breathe out.Thank you.You got troubled? Yes. I thought so.Let me give you some advice.Don't try to drive your troubles away.First, you're gonna bemad at the world.You push your foot down on thatgas pedal, and then you go.Tomorrow, the sun will come outlike it did this morning.Take it easy.Cookies.So what was I saying?So she said to herself,""You get in solid with the director.He puts you in solidwith the producer.You wind up with a big partnership.""So two days, or should I say,two nights later......she was in, butt solid.Yeah, with the director,with his cousin...She was so busy being in solid withevery Tom, Dick, Harry and George......she wouldn't recognize a producerif one was under her pillow.Do you take sugar?So now time passes,and our heroine is very big.Yeah, but not in the theater.No, in all the wrong places.In  little black books...... divorce cases......two police blotters and onerestraining sheet in Bellevue's ward.Are you sure?Yeah, she hit it big.From a size  dress to a size .She went from lookinglike an orchid......to a face like a pan of worms.And all because......she said, ""With only a rag,a bone, a hank of hair......I will move the world my way!""What's the matter? I'm boring you?You live it up.You kick up your heels.You grab everything you can get.""You light the candle from one endto the other,"" like they say.And then one day, you too can be......the proud proprietor......of a very heavily mortgaged,roadside brothel......and wish you were dead.Good morning, darling. What time did you get in last night? Late.Did the private detective have any...?Detective? The man you'll see about the coat. Oh, him.He was on a job.I'm gonna see him again today.I've seen you drink......many times, but neverin the morning like this.Don't worry, Emily.It's not alcoholism.It's just a kind of medicine.Why don't you go back to bed?I can't.I have to go and lookfor your fur coat.Why do you feel so responsible? It disappeared while I was here. No one's blaming you. That's not the point. What is?I could tell you things aboutpeople, but never mind.You have enough problems of your own. Is there anything I can do? Yes.When I come back with that coat, whichI will, I want you to throw me out. Hi, Mama. Hello, darling.That looks pretty. You might like it for your bathroom. I would.I'm sorry I didn'tcome home last night.That's all right.I spent the night in a motel.Alone.I had some thinking to do.I saw a woman.Utterly proper,utterly conventional......utterly beautiful.You're beautiful too, dear.I have a face. That's not the kind of beauty I mean. What kind of beauty?The kind that comesfrom selfrespect, I guess.It shines.I've seen that kind.It takes a lifetime to find.I'm going to find it.I think you will.Butterfield  called.Any messages?Mr. Liggett says he has to see you.It's a matter of life and death.Did he say when or where?I've written it down.So you did take it.Yes. And I'm sorry, Liggett.May I sit down?That's up to you, honey. Would you care to order something? No, the lady's not going to order.Why did you bother to bring it back?Because it isn't mine.Because you're scared, you mean.Because you know I'm not an ordinaryJoe on your sleigh ride.Because you know, while I mighthave given you the world......l'd tear your head off if youstole as much as a nickel from me.Isn't that it?No.So you pick up the manwhen you want......and drop him like a bomb......when you want.Get lost! We're talking!People don't mean anything to you,do they?The way they feel in here.Not down where you live.I care about some people.For an hour......or a day or a week.Till you've had your kicks.Then you slither off to the next one.I'll talk to you tomorrow.There isn't gonna be any tomorrow.And for once,somebody's going to drop you.Go ahead, try that heel trick again.The one that gets the boys hot.And I'll rip this arm right out! May I say something? Sure......honey, babe, dollface, kid.Say something sexy!Something that always got the boysheaded for the motel.You can't have everything in life.Be grateful for the few things you doget, no matter where they come from.The pornographic......philosopher!Now, you just sit therelike a good tramp should......until I get out of your sight.I can't stomach being seenin public with you.Liggett.And don't you daremention my name again!You're a dirty joke, from oneend of this town to the other! That will be enough of that. Mind your own business! Now, look. Take it easy.There's other women in this place,including my wife.Hey! Take it easy, pal! Come on!I'm sorry. I'm sorry.I just must havegone berserk, I guess.He's gonna be all right.I'm awfully sorry, miss.Can I help you?Mr. Liggett! Good heavens, what happened? Get away.Liggett?For a lousy fur coat, you'd do this?You want me to give this backto my wife after you touched it?Leave me alone.Do you want a doctor?Yes, and tell him to make meunconscious before I can think.Who is it?Who is it?It's me.Can I get you anything?Ask me about the coat, Steve.Ask me.I see you still have it.Because it's mine.Every skin.Every thread.Every hair......is mine.And do you know why?Why?Because I earned it.Pretty good pay for one week.$  in fur a day.You and Liggett couldn't make it?That isn't the important thing now.The important thing is, Steve......I took money. Do you know what that makes me? Baby, don't.Let me cry.Let me cry!Like all the times I should have......and never could.I have to tell you something. I know all about you, Gloria. You don't know this.Nobody knows this......except a certain man somewhere......who I'd like to think of as standingin a lake filled with burning gasoline.Please, listen.I was .My father was dead.All older men seemedlike fathers to me.But I wanted one of my own......to sit in his lap......to hug him......and have him say I was beautiful.Do you remember Major Hartley?I remember him.Major Hartley.My mother's friend.He came down to Grand Central Stationone day to pick me up from camp.Mother was away visiting.He took me home.He let me sit on his lap.He let me hug him.He told me I was beautiful.He stayed in that housefor one week......and taught me more about evil thanany yearold girl in the world knew.Don't.You haven't heard the worst of it yet!I loved it!Every awful moment of it, I loved!That's your Gloria, Steve!That's your darling Gloria!I made a way of life out of it.The deep shame of it didn'thit me until it was too late.I couldn't go back to  again.I had one chance to stop it.One last chance.And I......I threw it......all away for  animals......sewn together in a coat.It's not all over.Give it another chance.Where you going? It doesn't matter. Wait!It matters a great deal,what you do.You've got to decidewhat you're gonna do next.I do too.Stay here tonight.Thank you, Steve.Anything you need?There is. A divorce.There's no call for such remorseover last night.Let's face it, Emily.I'm a failure as a husbandand as a man.Wes, I love you!I know you do.That makes the divorceall the more necessary......because I can't go ondisappointing you. Couldn't you try? No.Do you love her? That woman you were with. I seem to.But you fought over herand sent her away in a rage.Yes, I did.I was sick because I was afraidI was going to lose her.I hated her unreasonably becauseI couldn't stand losing her.Just as you hate me now.Good morning.Good morning, sweetheart.Open your eyes good and make sureyou know who you're talking to. Norma, isn't it? Shrewd guess.I wanna marry you today.I haven't anything else to do.Good. I'll be ready in a minute.Fine. Thank you very much.Okay. Bye.I've just called Butterfield to shut off the service......and to send me a bill.As soon as I have an address inBoston, will you forward it to me?Yes, dear, I will.Take care of Mama.I've got plans for her.My cousin Harry. Oh, Frances! I'm a born matchmaker.%, of course.Naturally!I don't want to be a nosyneighbor, but why Boston?That's where the Pilgrimsmade a fresh start.If it's good enough for them,I can take it.Can Boston take you?What will you do in Boston, dear?Well, I'll buy a paper.Look up the want ads.Same as any girl without a job.Before we all start crying,let's get the luggage in the car.This is as closeas I'll ever get to heaven.Do you like it?Of course not. I'm only faintfrom not eating in three days.It's yours.No.Wear it in good health.Oh, no.You can't bribe me with this.I could never say a mean word aboutyou ever again. I'd die of boredom.Well, then just keep it warm for me.Goodbye, Mama.I don't want you to go.I have a feelingyou'll never come back.I never will come back, Mama.But I'll send for youas soon as I can.Did she leave any forwardingaddress or number?Now, look......this is the most importanttelephone call of my life.You must tell me, please.Boston?You're certain?Thank you, Butterfield .Thanks.Don't be frightened, Gloria. Please.I can only think of one apology.Will you marry me?I've arranged for a divorce.Wait for me and......l'll make you forget every wordI uttered last night.You can't.I'm left with those words.I'm branded with them.Thank you for asking me to marry you.If only you'd done it yesterday,it might have meant something.But not today.But I only didwhat I did last night......because you were so muchin my blood that I exploded.But you were right last night.No man could marry me......and not keep remembering.You'd have to explodeat my life, past and...You couldn't help but explode.I can think of a dozen apologies.Oh, I know.And I'd accept.But then look.Look at all the thousandsof explosions ahead......and the thousandsof apologies and acceptances......until we both got so disgusted. I love you. I love you.And I love you.It's no use. It's no damn use.Let's go someplace to talk.Over at Happy's.Just talk.Just so that we can betogether and alone.So that I can tell youwhat I want to do.If I get in a room with you......together, alone......I know what will happen.It'll be the same thingall over again.We started this whole thing together.We're obligated to solve it together.Please.Hello, Mr. Liggett.You brought another weary traveler.Hi, honey.Welcome home. Give me a key, Happy. IH eys, that's my business. Here pass the most beautiful... Give me a key.Yeah, yeah. Right away.You saw the accident?Yes.Your name, please.Weston Liggett. Fifth Avenue, New York City.I stopped that same girl for speeding.I wish I'd put her in jail then. They didn't make her name yet? No. Gloria Wandrous. You knew her?We were traveling north......together.You're going to read about itin the newspapers tomorrow.The family name......your picture, my picture......everything.I'm......sorry.I don't understand. What's happened? Tell me. She's dead.She lived for an hour unconscious. But she's dead. Who? That girl? Yes. Terrible. Automobile accident.She was......trying to get away from me.I'm sorry. So sorry.I don't suppose that anybody wouldthink that she was a good person.But, strangely enough, she was.On the surface, she was allsex and devilmaycare.Yet everything in her wasstruggling toward respectability.She never gave up trying.I'm going out looking for my pride.Alone.When I find it, if you're here,I'll come back.And we'll see if it......still has any value......to either of us."
Exodus,1960,"The island of Cyprus, madam.World famous for beauty and long, tragic history.Been conquered many times.Conquered by Phoenicians, Assyrians,Persians, Macedonians.Also conquered by Greeks, Romans,Byzantines, Turks.Purchased from Turkeyby your esteemed self, the British Empire.All Cyprus most fond of the British.I'm an American.Fond of Americans also.We Cypriots are fond of everybody.Shall we go through the castle now?No, I've changed my mind.Then maybe the Tower of Othelloat the harbour of Famagusta. It’s included in the tour. All right.What's the matter here?Prison ship has arrivedfull of Jews for the camps, madam. What camps? Detention camps out at Karaolos.You see, the Jews, they charter a shipfrom Europe to get to Palestine.Then the British catch the shipand send the whole bunch here.The Arabs don't want them in Palestine.The British don't want them here, either. But they got them. Stop!Get him!Maybe you can back upand drive me to this address.House of the British Commander.Now, then. Get his feet. Right.Up.Mrs. Fremont?The General's expecting you in the garden.How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?I'm very glad to see you.Please sit down.Found that here in the garden.From the colour,I'd say it belongs to the Byzantine period.The Byzantines occupied Cyprus for centuries.Gives one an idea how temporaryour claims to the world's real estate are.I'm ashamed to say I really don't knowanything about archaeology.Few people do.Didn't you once publish somethingabout the Roman ruins in Cheltenham?A very obscure something. How did you know?Tom mentioned it in one of his letters.He was very proud of your friendship.As I was of his.Will you have tea, or something livelier?Something livelier, please. Is that ice I see? Surprised?Tom got me into the habit.Now I use ice in practically everything.There we are.May we drink to Tom?Of course.I'm extremely sorry circumstancescompelled us to bury him in the field.Even sorrier I was transferred from Palestine...before I got the chance to see you.It wasn't your fault.It took me almost a week to arrange passage.But your letter was waiting there for me,and Tom's things.I really shouldn't have let him go with us.It was only a border affair.One of the Jewish undergroundshad blown up half a dozen bridges.It really wasn't important enoughto lose one's life for.Is anything?In my opinion, yes.I've known many soldiers, Mrs. Fremont,and war correspondents...and news photographers,such as your husband.But I think perhaps Tomwas the bravest man I've ever met.We have a saying in Indiana:""The braver the bird, the fatter the cat.""Perhaps.Do you recognize this photograph, General?Of course. It was his last.Do you remember how Tom got that shot?We were together.I must confess, my eyes weren't on himwhen he snapped the shutter.The aircraft came in low.We were both in the truck.I jumped down on one side to take cover,and Tom jumped down on the other side.Tom couldn't have taken coverand photographed the plane as he did.I dare say you're right.He had a strong sense of duty.He also had a strong sense of death.I felt I had to confirm what I suspectedabout the last photograph.I'm very grateful to you.That's over a year ago.How have you been occupying yourself? After I lost the child I was... The child?Didn't Tom tell you we had a child on the way?Men like Tom are often quite reticentabout things that are nearest to their hearts.I understand.It was quite late in my pregnancywhen Tom was killed.Apparently the Palestine trip was too much.I lost the baby in the hospital at Jerusalem.And then I went backto my old profession of nursing.I've just completed my tour of dutywith the US Public Health Service in Greece.Very good. What are your plans for the future?I haven't quite decided yet.I may travel a while before I go home.I have passage booked on a freighterthat sails next week to Istanbul.From there I may go to Lydia.I've always wanted to see the Vale of Kashmir.It's probably the most beautiful spot on earth.Mrs. Fremont, may I introduce Maj. Caldwell? How do you do? How do you do? Have a drink. Thank you. I'd love one. How did your disembarkation go? Smoothly.We're really up to our neck in Jews, sir.Karaolos bursting at the seamsand more to come.I still say we should send them backwhere they came from.Two loads were shipped out of Haifabound for Hamburg.I don't see why we can't do the same thing.I shouldn't like to have a handin sending a Jew back to Germany.Squeeze them in as best as you can.They're squeezed in.Short of bed space, supplies...short of nurses, short of temper,short of everything.Mrs. Fremont's a nurse.Why don't you lend a hand at Karaolos?No, General. I'm afraid I couldn't.I've really been quite tired lately.And I don't know anything about them.About the Jews?I feel strange among them.In what way?Now that you mention it, I can't think.It's just a feeling I get. Will you have another drink? Thank you, no. I really must leave.I'm touring the islandand my guide is very firm with me. I’ll take you to your car. Thank you for the drink and the talk.Drive by Karaolos on your tour.Ring me if there's anything I can doto make your stay more comfortable.I will.I'm very fond of the old man. One of the best.Makes it all the more difficultto explain his little quirk.Quirk?About the Jews.You caught it all right. I was watching.Almost makes one believe the storyone hears now and then.Probably nonsense, but still...What story?That if you gave a good shake to his family tree,you'd find a Jew up there.Please tell Gen. SutherlandI've changed my mind.I’ll be happy to work at Karaolos for a few days. Goodbye, Major. Goodbye. Do you need any help? No, thanks. Good night, then. Good night, and thanks for stopping.Ari! Ari Ben Canaan! Reuben. How are you? Fine.The car's up there.Good. We'll go directly to Mandria.We can't, Ari.He's on the other side of the island. He won't be back until tomorrow. He should be on this side of the island.British checkpoint, Jewish checkpoint.We don't allow our military personnelin the camp area...unless something extraordinary occurs.We handle the outside. The inside's up to them. Lieutenant, this is Katherine Fremont. How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?American. Authority Gen. Sutherland.Pass her at all times. Very good, sir. Thank you.These Zionist organizations,or whatever they call them...send their own people over from Palestineto administer these camps.Jews seem to respond better to their own kind.Perhaps we all do.We even give them the privilegeof approving all Gentile personnel. I hope you don't mind. Not at all. Good morning, Ben Ami. Good morning, sir.This is Mrs. Fremont,an American friend of Gen. Sutherland. How do you do? How do you do?Ben Ami is one of the Palestinianswho run this camp.Mrs. Fremont has a few days to while awayin Cyprus, and being an experienced nurse...the general thought you may findher assistance valuable.We find all assistance of value, Maj. Caldwell. Would you show him your passport? Of course.Any friend of Gen. Sutherland'sis always welcome.Convey my respects to the general,and thank him for us.Of course. Goodbye. Good luck. Call us if you need us. Thank you. Would you care to come with me? Surely.Yesterday's shiploadwill double our hospital capacity.It's very good of you to help us get organized. Leave me alone. You're burning up with fever.If you don't let us clean out the infectionyou'll die, that's all.After coming so far,you'll die without ever having seen Eretz Israel.I’ll see Palestine before you. Now leave me alone.This woman is trying to help you. Do as she says. Who are you?He's the Palestinian commander, that's who.A Jewish policeman, working for them.I know your kind from Auschwitz. You can't tell me what to do. We'll see. I’ll hold him. Just try.Dov! If you don't let them help you, you'll die.I want to die.You don't know what you're saying.I’ll take them off myself. It won't hurt.Keep away from me, all of you.Excuse me.I think I can talk to him better if we're alone.We came on the Star of David together,and I know him. He's just shy.Don't get too close to the glass.Dov Landau, you ought to beashamed of yourself. Put that down.I won't.That hurt.Not half as bad as it will hurt.I’ll teach you. I’ll beat you all over.Well? Do you let them take care of you or not?Not them. But if you want to do it, well, all right.Thank you.And don't you ever spit on me again.Just remember. It's all right, I’ll do it. How did you change his mind?Just patience and kindness.Yetta will show you around.Don't hesitate to call on me if I can help.Thank you.Now, this is pavilion number two.Excuse me.This boy has a skin infection called impetigo. He needs sulfathiazole on those scabs. If the camp has no such drug?Leave him alone.That will spread it all over his body. You think so? I know it. It's terribly contagious.My dear, it's this way.If you have no sulfathiazole...and no ammoniated mercury ointment...which was the earlier pharmacology,you soften the scab with soap and water...and gently remove it like this, you see?Then expose the lesionfor five minutes to the sun.That's also a cure. You're a doctor. By coincidence.It was stupid of me to interfere.I'm a nurse. I’ll be working here for a while.Please forgive me.Dr. Odenheim, it's time for you to rest.You've been up all night. I know how to do this. He taught me on the ship. Thank you, child of light.I’ll find you something to wear over your dress,a gown or an apron.Thank you.My name is Katherine Fremont. I'm a nurse. You can call me Kitty. My name's Karen Hansen.Hansen? Then your mother was Jewish? Yes, and my father. Reuben. Shalom, Ari. David, how are you? Shalom, Ari. Mr. Mandria, this is Ari Ben Canaan. Welcome.Very pleased to meet you.We've heard good things about you in Palestine. Rumours. But I like them. So do we.Please sit down. Cigar? No, thanks.Well, David,how many people have you got by now...in that barbed wire jungle of yours?Over ,.And they're building for , moreon the other side of the island.How many arrived yesterdayon the Star of David?Six hundred and eleven.We're going to take the same  off the islandand land them in Palestine. Six hundred and eleven? He thinks he's Moses.We haven't been able to breakmore than  or  at a time out of Karaolos.This will be a new experience.One thing more. There's a time limit.Today is Tuesday.We'll stage the break next Monday. Next Monday? Why not tomorrow?Ari, we cannot do it.The United Nationswill vote on the Palestine issue...before the end of this session.Between now and thenwe have to show the world...thousands of homeless European Jews...are not going to accept any solutionthat bars them from Palestine.A mass escape of the very same peoplewho arrived on the Star of David...is worth more than a million speeches.But this isn't the Red Sea, Ari.It's the Mediterranean.Right. Smite these waters as you will,they do not part.That's why you'll have to get us a ship.I want a legitimate freighter...with legal registry and real cargowe can unload here in Cyprus.A ship for six...That's a wonderful idea.Brilliant.But the expense will be brilliant also.Not too brilliant.You know, our treasury is based on donations,and right now we're rather low. Well, can you deliver or not? I’ll do my best.We Cypriots are with you.For the Jews, Mandria will do everything.The Jews have paid you well for your efforts,Mr. Mandria. Ari, you've got to understand... No, Reuben. I say it.Do you believe that I, Plato Mandria,would do this for money?Do you think I'd risk years in prison for money?I tell you, it has cost me over £,since I work with the Haganah.You owe him an apology, Ari.I do apologize, Mr. Mandria.It was a stupid remark.Not necessary.If I apologize each time I get stupid,I'd spend a lifetime on my knees. Also, we'll need  lorries. , he says. Why not ,?The British have requisitioned every car,truck and lorry on this island.Haganah makes mistakes just like anybody else.This is one of them.David, I want to hear every objection,every criticism, every suggestion, but only once. Now the boat project is under way, right? Almost accomplished.I will send a telegram to a shipbroker in Athens. Don't the British monitor telegrams? Naturally.But some of the monitors are Cypriots.They'd like the Britons in Britain,the Jews in Palestine...and the Cypriots in Cyprus.Not, mind you, that I'm antiBritish.If I must have a master,the British are far the best.But the problem, my dear friend, is,why have a master at all?Shouldn't have hurt him, Ari. He's a real friend.Maybe, but don't let the Mandrias fool you.They work for us and say how terrible it was...that ,, Jews went into the oven.But when the showdown comes,we always stand alone.Mandria will sell us out like all the others.We have no friends, except ourselves.Remember that.You're wrong,but you'll have to learn that for yourself.Now tell me, how is Jordana?I think she's in love.You've had this letter since last night...I forgot about it.He's in love with her, so he thinks everyone is.He's right.She mention me in there?Thank you. No, thank you. None for me.How did you know I postponed my departure?Central Intelligence has a great talentfor spying on the innocent.It'll interest them to learnthat I have a plot under way.Good. Can you tell me about it?There's a child at the campI'd like to take out for a holiday.Just for luncheon,and perhaps to buy her some clothes.Then I take itsome of the strangeness has worn off?I know it was foolish to say that.But I can't help it. I do feel strange among them.Except for this girl.Somehow she's entirely different.Her point of view, the way she works...she acts, feels and speaksalmost exactly like an American.I can think of no higher praise.You're laughing at me, and I deserve it.I'm not laughing. I'm simply glad it worked. What? I wanted you to get interested...in somethingbeside your own troubles, and you did.It's interesting that you saw it so fast. Of course, you were absolutely right. I'm glad you weren't offended.I shouldn't like you to become a woman...who drifts through life, ""fair to no purpose...""...artful to no end,young without lovers, old without a friend.""Do you have a solution?If I were  years youngerI'd offer myself as a solution.The Vale of Kashmir is no goodunless you share it with someone.Places don't mean anything.Only people are important.Fill your life with people.Let Tom return to the grave where he belongs.Fred! Yes, sir? There's a child out at Karaolos...Mrs. Fremont would like released for a day.What's her name?Karen Hansen. See to it for me, will you? Very well, sir. Isn't it a little irregular? Extremely.That's why I want your signature on the passinstead of my own.Yes, sir.Thank you.Isn't she a beauty?You must have towed it across.All right, she's no beauty,but her heart is solid oak. You'll see.Ari!Hank, how are you?Hank Schlosberg from Cincinnati.He's run more ships through the blockadethan anyone.This is Mr. Mandria, who arranged for this tub. Not a bad ship. Not a good one, Mr. Mandria.For the money we pay,every ship cannot be the Queen Mary.Can this abortion make it to Palestine?On my mother's honour, she has made  trips...from Cyprus to Turkey under her last owner.That's just the trouble.We can hold her together for one more round.I want a loudspeaker system aboard.Get me a power unitand six AlmecThorston speakers.There is no such equipment for sale in Cyprus.If you can't buy it, steal it.Stock it with provisions for five days. For a twoday trip? Five days.All prepared foods, either canned or packaged.The most expensive, naturally. Have you got my jeep yet? I told you, it's impossible.A jeep is out of the question, absolutely. Need someone to overhaul the engine tank? No, my gang can take care of that. Mr. Mandria? Yes?What about that jeep there?That belongs to His Beatitude...the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Cyprus.Steal it. Paint it. Hide it till I'm ready for it.The water's wonderful.May I have another swim before my steak?Just once more,because we're due back at the camp. Is that the girl? Yes.Swims just like an American. I’ll buy you a drink if you'll forget that joke. I just had one.She is nice.Would it be too difficult to arrangefor me to take her back to America?Not from our end.We'd be glad to let them all go.So long as they don't end up in Palestine.Let me know when you've decided.I’ll get Maj. Caldwell to arrange it for you.Thank you.Karen.Coming.Would you like to go to America?Of course. Everybody likes to go to America.Then you will go.I’ll cancel the rest of my trip,and I’ll take you with me.And you can go to school there,and later on to the university.And if you like it, and want to,you can become an American citizen.You mean, go right away?Perhaps. In the next week or two.Meanwhile, I may be able to get you out of camp.I’ll speak to the general tonight. What's the matter? Nothing.You do want to go, don't you?Yes, but I mean...I must think about it a little. What is there to think about? I don't know.But it's so important, and I need a little time.You know, to think.Take all the time you wish. Kitty? Yes? Don't be mad at me. Of course not.It's getting late. You better finish your steak.Fine thing, what you want to do for Karen.She told you?She is worried about her father.I didn't know that her father was alive.When Karen was six,he smuggled her out of Germany to Denmark.After the war she went back to find her parents.The Jewish Agency had records of the dead.She found her mother on the Dachau list...together with her two younger brothers.About the father there was nothing,so naturally she hopes he is still alive.Maybe in Palestine.As a matter of fact, there is such a possibility.He was a very important scientist.The Nazis could have spared his life...in order to use his brain.But of course, who knows?It's curiousthat she didn't mention her father to me.You must understand somethingabout these children.Their past is scarred. They're ashamed of it.To have a parent who has been persecuted,or killed in a concentration camp...is a reproach to them.They feel guilty for having survived.So they pretend the bad things never happened.To take such a child is a great responsibility... even a sacrifice. It's no sacrifice.I'm alone. The insurance I gotafter my husband's death is more than enough.I didn't mean financial sacrifice,although it's a good thing to have money.No, what I meant was,you will have to make a sacrifice of yourself.These children who have lost everything...spend their lives searching for new parents.Their need reaches out to your heartas naturally as a flower turns to the sun.And they trap you.Because they've been so long without love,they demand all the love you have.Karen will drain you of love. She'll exhaust you.That's exactly what I need.I'd like to go with you, Kitty.If you still want me. Morning. Morning. Bowen, rd GT Company. What can I do for you, sir?Afraid I’ll to have to draw rather heavily on you. Please have a chair. Thank you.This does draw us down a bit.Excuse me a moment. Operator. CO, please.Won't take a minute.I hope not. As you can see, I'm in a hurry. CO speaking. Hall here, sir.I've an order at transport pool, sir, for  lorries... motorcycles,  drivers and  guards.Estimated use four hours, sir. What's this for? Transport from Karaolos, sir. Who is requesting this? Capt. Bowen. What authority? Sir Cecil Bradshaw, of the Colonial office. Yes. Countersigned Lt. Gen. Sutherland. Well, allocate it then. Yes, of course, sir. What's the query? I thought you might want...to draw extra transport from headquarters. Don't babble on, man. Give it to him. Yes, sir.And get on with it.Very good, sir.Smithers. Take this and get it filled at once. Yes, sir. We'll have you taken care of in a jiff.Can I order tea for you?Rather prefer a gin and tonic, if you don't mind. Bowen, rd transport company. Lt. Arnold, sir.I want to see the Palestinian camp commander.Right this way, sir.This is the Palestinian commander,David Ben Ami. How do you do? How do you do?We are relocating all the interneesfrom the Star of David.Here are your orders.Where are you taking these people?Their destination is not includedin your orders, Mr... Ben Ami. Yes. Thank you.These people have not recoveredfrom their last journey.I cannot permit them to travel again so soon,just because of a piece of paper.Piece of paper? This seems perfectly clear to me. Sir, some of these people are sick.You will turn the internees over at once.I'm sorry. I just cannot accept that responsibility.I’ll take the responsibility. There, does that satisfy you? Of course, I don't approve, but...I guess it makes the record perfect.Would you order himto place all his Palestinian...administrative personnel at my disposalwhile loading? Did you hear? Yes, sir.You can call on meif you run into any trouble, sir.Thanks, old chap.Well, let's get about it.Attention.All passengers from the Star of David,listen carefully.We have received ordersto evacuate you immediately.I repeat. All those who arrivedon the Star of David...are to be evacuated at once.Please prepare to board the British lorriesnow passing through the camp.Report at onceto your nearest Palestinian guard point.What does this mean? HMJFC?His Majesty's Jewish Forces on Cyprus,what else? What's going on? Military police.They're blocking the intersectionfor through traffic.I don't understand.Go and find the commanding officer, will you?I'd better look into this myself.Excuse me, Mrs. Fremont.Stay here. Sergeant, clear the way for my car. Yes, sir.I'm afraid this is most unusual.We've had no warning.I’ll check with headquarters.These orders are perfectly clear.Signed by the Colonial Officeand countersigned by Gen. Sutherland.What's this? The whole area's tied up. Who's in charge? O'Hara.Permit me. Bowen, rd GT Company.Special detail, orders of Gen. Sutherland.Here are the papers, sir.Well, Bowen, I see you're going to begetting rid of some Jews for us? Yes, sir. Shipping them back to Hamburg. That's where they belong.It's a German matter. Let the Germans handle it.Apparently the general's had second thoughts.Why do you question these orders?I didn't question.I just wanted to check with headquarters.Countersigning is not the responsibilityof junior officers.The acceptance of responsibility...is what makes senior officers out of juniors. Let them through. Yes, sir.Should have started this policy two years ago.I don't care about the Jews one way or the other. But they are troublemakers. No question about it, sir.Get two of them together, you've got a debate...and three, a revolution.Yes. And half of them are Communists anyway.Yes, and the other half pawnbrokers.They look funny, too. I can spot one a mile away.Would you mind looking into my eye?It feels like a cinder.Certainly.You know, a lot of themtry to hide under Gentile names.But one look at that face, and you just know.With a little experience, you can smell them out. I'm sorry, I can't find a thing. Must've been my imagination. Thanks.Maj. Caldwell, are they taking everybodywho was on the Star of David? Yes, ma'am, we are. Then Karen's on one of those trucks.Karen?Karen Hansen.I have Gen. Sutherland's permissionto take her to America. We were on our way to pick up the girl. How old is she?Fourteen. She was assigned to the hospital.Yes, it seems to me...Is that the girl that the...forgot his name, the camp commander,was talking about?David Ben Ami? Yes.He knew she was supposed go with me.I remember. He told methe general had made arrangements for her...so I left her behind, on my own responsibility. Very good, Bowen. Thank you very much.I appreciate your help.Convey my respects to the general.That I will. Bit of a Jew himself, you know. Not really?Good luck, sir.Remember, I've been in Palestine.I know what kind of life she'll live, if she lives.I grant you that.Besides, she must have been forced,otherwise she would've left a note.We'll get her back for you, one way or another.With her consent, of course.Who was in charge of this evacuation?Chap named Bowen, sir. Capt. Bowen. What did he look like? Look like?A well set up sort of chap.Proper bearing, decent decorations.Spoke like any of us. From what command? rd GT Company, sir. Is anything irregular? Could be.We don't list a rd GT Company on Cyprus.You should have known that.Yes, I should. Perhaps I made an error. It's human.Who issued Capt. Bowen's orders?They originated with Bradshawof the Colonial Office.And, of course, you signed them. You examined the signatures? Well, naturally, and I countersigned.I signed no such order.Neither have I seen such an orderfrom the Colonial Office.Well, those signatures must've been forged?We can't exclude the possibility.With one exception, of course. Your signature was genuine, wasn't it? Someone had to take responsibility, sir.And you took it. Now you've got it.What do you propose to do with it?That boat...That Olympia...She's not going to Hamburg.She's probably heading for Palestine.Undoubtedly.Telephone control, tell them to block the harbour.Take a look at the situation yourself.Very well, sir.Mrs. Fremont. Sir.Let me have the microphone.Attention, Olympia. Attention, out there.This is Maj. Caldwell speaking.Attention, Olympia.You have no chance to escape.The destroyer Zebra is moving into positionto block the harbour entrance.Return to dock.Otherwise we will board you.We're bound for Palestinewith an American captain and crew...and a passenger manifest of  persons.We're carrying  pounds of dynamitein the engine room with fuses attached.You let one British soldier step aboardthis ship and we'll blow her up.Have you heard me, Major?Message received.Where would they find  pounds of dynamite? Get me Gen. Sutherland. Operator. Connect me to Gen. Sutherland. Yes, sir.In an ammunition dump, you blithering idiot. Sutherland here. Caldwell here, sir.The Olympia threatens to blow herselfout of the water, sir, if we board her.I'm convinced it's a bluff, of course.Boarding party en route, sir.Call your boarding party back.Signal the Olympia.I'm asking London for instructions.If she stays where she is, no one will molest her.They've threatened to dynamitethe Olympia if we board her.Do you think they mean it?Nearly two years ago, a Haganah shipwhich we were detaining in the port of Haifa...did blow herself up.  refugees died.General, I simply must get Karen off the ship.Would you care to go on board the Olympia...and learn from the childexactly what happened? Will they let me? I’ll try and arrange it.If I succeed, you can do me a favour in return.I’ll do anything.If force, or coercion of any kind,was used to get that child on board the ship...you must promise me to tell the entire story...at a press conference which I shall arrange. Do you agree? I’ll be glad to.Reuben?Send this every  minutes,and keep on sending it. Could we interrupt, please? Yes.This is Dr. de Vries. We elevated ourselvesinto a medical committee.Good.It's our opinion the sanitary arrangementson this ship are hopelessly inadequate.Unless we makesome additional bathing and toilet facilities...we'll have a serious health problem.All right, we'll try to take care of it.There he is. This is Mrs. Fremont,from Gen. Sutherland. How do you do? Hank? Yes. We have enough scrap lumber to buildprivies on deck?  I guess so. Tenholers. Knock some showerstogether, too.  Okay. Anything else? Not for the present, thank you.This one to Haifa.You wanted to see me?Yes, Captain.""Yes, Captain."" His Majesty's Jewish Brigade.North Africa, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.The decorations are real.Is that what Sutherland sent you to find out?You lied to me about the girl.She's not at the camp, she's on this ship.And you forced her to come aboard. We don't force anybody. Tel Aviv yet? No.Go on.You're not listening.I heard every word you said.I lied to you about the girl. What else?I'm taking her off this death trap.Don't tell me what you'll do on this ship.You'll do exactly what I tell you. Tel Aviv beginning to send. Fine.How do you know the girl wants to get off?I am trying to save a Jewish child.Can't you understand that?Don't you have any respect for human life?Don't expect me to get hystericalover one Jewish child...and don't you get hysterical, either.You're late, lady. You're  years late.Almost ,, Jewish children,butchered like animals...because nobody wanted them.No country would have them.Not your country or any other.And nobody wants the ones who survived.Jewish flesh is cheap, lady.It's cheaper than beef.It is cheaper, even, than herring.You and your respect...Tel Aviv complete now.If you can find the girl, if she wants to go,take her. Take a dozen if you want to.Kitty!It happened so fast,I couldn't even leave you a note.I had to go, Kitty, to find my father.When you asked me to go to America,I didn't know, and...Kitty, we're going to Palestine.Karen, you don't know what it's like in Palestine.And the British won't let you go, anyhow.They'll have to, Kitty. They'll just have to.Because we're not going back to Karaolos,not ever.Then let me take you to Palestine.I can find a way. The man in charge, Mr... Ben Canaan?Yes.If you want to come with me,you have his permission.I couldn't leave now, Kitty.I don't know how to explain itto someone like you.But we all came here together,and now we're trying to do something.And I must stay here, Kitty.Gen. Sutherland calling the Olympia.This is the Exodus. Come in, General.I have received instructionsfrom the Colonial Office in London.No attempt will be made to board the Olympia...but the harbour will remain blocked.You may return to Karaolos whenever you wish.If you choose to remain in the ship...provisions and medical supplieswill be sent to you as you need them.Message completed.Not even now?Kitty...I couldn't.It's like leaving your family when things are bad.I know.If you want anything, let me know.Yes. Gen. Sutherland's your friend.Tell him to let us go to Palestine.They're just going to turn this shipinto another concentration camp.Go back? Nonsense.Did we escape for just ourselves alone? No.We've done it for hundreds of thousandsof Jews all over Europe...who couldn't get out.Also it makes news. World news.I want your attention for a minute.Now you all heard Gen. Sutherlandon the loudspeaker.You must now make a decision.You can go back to Karaolos...The only way to go back to Karaolosis by crawling!or you can stay aboard this ship.Who are you making the propaganda for?Them or us?Quiet, please. There's another possibility.You were picked by Haganah for this ship...so that your escape to Palestinewould have some meaning to the world.If you still want it to have some meaning...if you want to finish what we began,you can go on a hunger strike.Now you're beginning to make a little sense!We shall tell to the British,""We spit on your food.""And the little food we've got here,we shall throw overboard.We are going to Palestine,or we're going to die right here.Listen, please.Now just stop and think for a minute.To go on a hunger strikeis a very serious business...because once you strike...it can only end when you have wonor when you are dead.What is so unusual about the Jews dying?Is that anything new?I stay right here.There is no excuse for us to go on living...unless we start fighting right now.So that every Jew on the face of the earth...can begin to start feelinglike a human being again.You heard what I said.Fight, not beg!Fight!Wait a minute.Everybody aboard this ship...agreed to accept Haganah discipline.I am now giving an order.We will sit down...and we will maintain silence for  minutes.Each one of us will listen to his own heart...and to his brain, too.And then we will vote.We will now maintain silence.I saw the people on that ship.They're not dangerous.They're just poor, miserable people.Why can't you let them go?You must understand that we Britishhave shown, throughout our history...an extraordinary talentfor troublesome commitments.Palestine is a British mandate imposed upon us...by the League of Nations...which makes us responsiblefor keeping peace in the area.The Arabs simply won't keep the peaceif we allow further Jewish immigration.I don't know much about the mandate.But I do know the Jewswere promised a homeland in Palestine.During the First World War,Britain needed and accepted Jewish support...from all over the world.In return...the Balfour Declaration of made such a promise.That promise was reconfirmedduring World War II.This chap Ben Canaan probably wasn't lyingwhen he said he fought with us.Thousands of Palestinians did.How can you promise somethingand then not deliver it?England was fighting for her life in .Nations are very like peoplein such circumstances.They make promisesthey're not immediately able to fulfil.During that same crisis,we made the Arabs certain assurances.Hence, they have their claims, too.The Arabs are fanaticson the subject of Jewish immigration.Just now, we need their goodwill. How is it ever going to end? I don't know.The whole question nowis before the United Nations.I hope they solve it.The sooner I stop operating detention camps,the happier I’ll be.That goes for every British officerand soldier I know.Thank you.Yes?The devil.Of course.Send a boat alongside at once.I’ll join you in  minutes.They want to send  people back to Karaolos.The rest have declared a hunger strike. Can I drop you at your hotel? Of course.a few news bulletins, and an announcement.The evacuation of , British womenand children from Palestine...was ordered today by the High Commissioner.The United Nations Commission on Palestinestill has not submitted its report.The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem...who sat out the war as Hitler's guest in Berlin...has met in Aley, Lebanon,with representatives of the Arab nations...to coordinate action against Palestinian Jews...in the event Partition is granted.The UN Commission on Palestinehas arrived at Flushing Meadows...and is now preparing its finalrecommendation for the assembly.News of the hunger strike aboard the Exodus...received frontpage treatmentthis morning throughout the world.The British embassy in Washingtonis already being picketed.Now Dr. Odenheim has something to say to youfor the medical committee.It is very importantthat we save our supply of fresh water.So we must ration it. Every four hours, one cup.On the other hand,everyone must wash his body daily.This will be done with seawater.Your platoon leader will callwhen your turn comes.It is advised to conserve your energy.So all necessary physical workshould be divided...among as many people as possible.If at any time you should feel lightheadedor dizzy, do not be frightened.It is, in no respect, serious.Just sit downand lower your head between your knees.All of us, of course, feel stomach pangs. They are uncomfortable, but not dangerous. That's right.Final point...people can live a long time without food,a very long time.Attention, everybody.Here is the news,and some of it, I'm sorry to say, not good.Dov Gruner and three other leadersof the Irgun in Palestine...were hanged today in Acre prison.The United Nations Commissionon Palestine is still delaying...its recommendations to the General Assembly.Winston Churchill has called onthe Labour government to end what he calls...""...this squalid war against the Jews,""with all possible speed.  Americans picketed... Your water, gentlemen.UN headquarters in Flushing Meadows,demanded release...Your platoon's turn to bathe, Mr. Lakavitch.Your turn to bathe.Mr. Smolikov, will you please do me a favour?Refresh yourself with my bath,and then, little bit later, I’ll take yours. All right. Thank you.Sorry, Mr. Lakavitch. You know the rules. Can't you see the position? No exceptions.I think you carry this bathing too far. No exceptions, Mr. Lakavitch. Fanatics!establishment of a Jewish statein the Holy Land.Thirteen leaders of ourNational Committee in Tel Aviv...have begun a hunger strikein sympathy with the Exodus.When more news comes in, I’ll report it.That's all.Have you time for me, Ari?Always, Dr. Odenheim. What can I do?We made a mistake...a bad mistake in letting the childrenbe a part of this.A child's body grows every hour.They need food more than adults.Their blood requires more sugar.What should we do about it?When a mistake is made, you admit it...you analyse it, and you correct it.Doctor, don't you feel well?Who cares if an old man feels well?Major! Who the devil are you? Jorgenson, of the UP. Thanks, Major. All right.What is this? Information, sir. Information for whom?For the tourists, of course.One of our many special services.And I suppose these are tourists?No, sir. These people are contributors.We are collecting donations for the Red Cross.Forgive me.What did you say?What were you two talking about?I said to him:""These are nice fat ones,for this the archbishop will bless you.""He said to me, ""I do my share.""Word for word, a literal translation.Don't try to deceive me.You're collecting all this for the Olympia. You see through me like a piece of glass. Complete waste of time.They won't accept food from us, nor from you.True, but they will acceptfrom the Red Cross when they sail.Perhaps you're right.What do you mean, ""when they sail""?It was my poor way of expressingconfidence in British justice.Good day.You'd better go up and tell them.Give me a hand here.Let us through, please.It gives me great pain to inform youDr. Odenheim has suffered a heart attack.He is dead.Shall I send it out?Why not?Professor Dr. Samuel Odenheim...head of the first clinic for Internal Medicine...at the University of Vienna,author of many medical textbooks...died today in the harbour of Famagusta...on board a cramped freighter going nowhere,because there wasn't room for him on this earth.Ought to make news somewhere.Attention, please.Prepare all children under the age of ...for return to Karaolos. This is an order. Out to the ship once more? Yes.You know, they're in their nd hour,and starting to crack already. I didn't know that. Fading fast.They never would have started this nonsense...if Ben Canaan hadn't held a gun to them. Do you really think so? Undoubtedly.Poor, ruddy beggars.I don't see how you stand them.Then let me ask you this, if I may.Do you have the power to call off this strike?I have.If a compelling reason turned up. Why?Then call it off.I've been talking to Gen. Sutherland.He's a humane man,but there's nothing he can do.You've made the issue so flatlythat no one can help you.I know it, I feel it.Either you compromise, or you lose.We won't lose.If the British give in and let us go, we've won.And if we starve to death aboard this ship,we've still won.They'll wait.They'll wait until you're too weakand then come aboard and take you off.It doesn't take much strengthto set off  pounds of dynamite.You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?Of course.Without any regardfor the lives you'd be destroying?With every regard in the world for them.I don't understand.Each person on board this ship is a soldier.The only weapon we have to fight withis our willingness to die.But for what purpose?Call it publicity. Publicity? Yes, publicity.A stunt to attract attention.A letter to the newspapers.A helpwanted ad to the official journalof the United Nations.""Wanted by  men,women and children, a country...""...a native land, a home.""That's all they're dying for.Just to call attention to Israel...without ever having seen it themselves.Does the vulgarity of it shock you?You can't fight the whole British Empirewith  people.It isn't possible.How many Minutemen did you havewhen they fired...the ""shot heard round the world""? I don't know. .Look, please understand me.I wish you could win.I wish it were possible for youto have a country of your own.But it isn't.You're offering the lives of all these peoplefor something that can never happen.I know. I've been in Palestine. When were you there? A year ago.Mr. Ben Canaan, even if you get a partitionand a free Jewish state...the Arabs won't let you keep it., Jews against  million Arabs?You can't win.You think I'm a fool.But I came to appeal to youto call off the hunger strike...and avoid a tragedy.Why don't you appeal to Gen. Sutherland?What can I tell him?Tell him what God said to Moses:""Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,'Thus sayeth the Lord:""'Let my people go, that they may serve me.""'Exodus, Chapter , Verse .We have been asked to talk to you,Mr. Ben Canaan. Do you have time? Of course.Excuse me.We have made a decision among the mothers.To send the children back to Karaolos nowwill show weakness.The British will seethat we are not serious people aboard this ship.It doesn't matter what the British think.I cannot take the responsibilityfor letting children starve to death.We will take the responsibility.We will not send them back,and we will not go back with them.I'm sorry, Mrs. Frankel.The children must go back.You go back if you want to with them.Now, that's a Haganah order.You're an important man,Mr. Ari Ben Canaan, but you know nothing.Look at these babies of mine.Born behind barbed wire.For the first time they don't have tolook out through a fence like little animals.They are free now, and nobody...no Englishman, no Haganah,will ever lock them up again.Look at Mrs. Hirschberg here.Hers will be the first,when she has no more milk to give. Tell him. I will not take him back to Karaolos.He will go to Palestine with me,or here on this ship, we will die together.I will not take him back.When are you going to stop this thingand let them go?Unfortunately, I can't answer that.The affair's entirely in the hands of London.But you don't like what's going on.You know how wrong it is.Why don't you say so?Why don't you make a public statement about it?I can't do that, Kitty. I'm a soldier.I know you're a soldier, but you're also a Jew...and all these people out there are Jews, too.I don't like to disappoint you,but I'm not in any degree a Jew. But I thought... I know the rumour.There had to be some explanation...for my attitudetowards this unpleasant business. I'm sorry for flying off like that. You're getting to be quite a Zionist.As a matter of fact, I'm glad you did fly off.You asked how I, as a Jew,could let this happen to other Jews.Now I find myself askinghow can any man let it happen?Jew, Gentile, Buddhist, Mohammedan...no matter what he is.Signal the air base.I'm flying to London within the hour.You know, you're an interesting woman,Mrs. Fremont.Sutherland won't let one memberof the press come aboard...and you shuttle back and forthlike a carrier pigeon.I know you suspect me,and I know nothing I say can make you trust me.But I wanted to tell youthat Gen. Sutherland has left for London.He understands your situation,and he is trying to help.Thanks.Is that all?I heard of Dr. Odenheim's death.I'm a trained nurse,and I worked with him at Karaolos.If I can be useful, I'd be glad to stay aboard.Without food?I think I can go without food as long as you.I'm glad to have you on board, Mrs. Fremont.Glad to be aboard, Mr. Ben Canaan.Whatever move you make,you were dead  minutes ago.I asked for an opinion from Romania?Do you think the British will give in?We'll give in first.These schlemiels.Maybe they think they've been hungryonce in a while.They don't even begin to knowwhat real starvation is.If you hate these people so much,why do you want to go to Palestine with them?Because there, Jews fight instead of talk.When I get there, I'm going to join the Irgun.They know how to do it.I'm going to blow up everyBritish installation I can find.I'm going to kill Englishmen...and kill and kill them...till there won't be any more. But the British aren't all bad. They're rotten, the whole bunch of them.The British, all the Russians, the Poles... Not the Danes. When I was there... Them, too. Don't tell me.That's not true.The Hansens were Christians,and they adopted me.One little exception. That proves something?There are lots of exceptions.You just listen to me for a minute.When the Nazis marched into Denmark...they ordered every Jewto wear a yellow armband...with the Star of David on it. And when they... That's the worst thing that can happen? I said, listen!You don't know what you're talking about.The next morning, when every Jew in Denmarkhad to wear his armband...King Christian came out of Amalienborg Palacefor his morning ride.And do you know something? He wore the Star of David on his arm. But why should...And you know something else?By afternoon,everybody was wearing Stars of David.Jews and Danes, and, well, just everybody.Why'd they do that?If you don't just know why they did it, Dov...well, maybe that's what's wrong with you. Get the Olympia. I want to talk to them. Yes, sir.Control Headquarters calling the Olympia. Do you hear me? This is the Exodus.Stand by for Maj. Caldwell.You are no longer interestedin your last rook, Mr. Lakavitch?We pause for politics?Gen. Sutherland, at his own request,has been relieved of his duties on Cyprus.I have just received a messagefrom the Colonial Office. I quote:""His Majesty's Government,having no desire to witness needless suffering...""...grants permissionfor the Olympia to sail to Palestine...""...and to disembark its passengersat the port of Haifa.""That is all.Ari Ben Canaan!Well, happy landing, Mrs. Fremont. You'll find your luggage at customs. Thank you.Have you seen Mr. Ben Canaan?I want to thank him for letting me on the ship.He and the other Haganah guyswent over the side two hours ago.Too many British soldierson the reception committee. Karen? Have you seen Dov?No, not since he left the ship. He was assigned to Gan Dafna. He'll show up.I'm going to the American consulateand then to the Jewish Agency.As soon as I find anything,I’ll come to Gan Dafna.Gan Dafna, all aboard. Bye, Karen. If you see Dov, tell him where I am.Inside.This is no accident, he's got the addresswritten down. Fetch the car.Here, you dirty little Irgun swine.Hello?Shalom.Yoav, take the dog out.Again?A boy about  just went into Asa's house.They took him in a police car. Get a look at him. What's your name? Karen. What's yours?Edna. Come, we'll go up and eat something.Now, if you will please resume a little order...I will introduce a manwho has done more than any other...to establish our village of Gan Dafna.Only  days ago...he was in London, negotiating with the British.Today he is home again.I have the honour to presentMr. Barak Ben Canaan...member of the Executive Committee...of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.My dear young friends, I know you're very tired.You've had a long trip,so I'm not going to make speeches.It's good to have parties like this.But it's also good to know what you're here for.You are here to learn. You are here to work.You are here to builda Jewish homeland in Palestine.It says on the banner ""young heroes."" Very fine.But here at Gan Dafna you will findthat even the biggest hero...must work in the fields,just like the littlest coward.Boys and girls,when I came to Palestine  years ago...it was not a musical receptionwith little cakes served.I came walking, with my little brother...all the way from Russia.And over in that valley,the swamps, and mosquitoes so big...they were picking fights with the sparrows.Now we have changed those swampsinto such fields.On a quiet night, you can hear the corn grow.Oranges so big...five already make a dozen.Over there you see the Arab village of Abu Yesha.In those days, my old friend Kammal...may God rest his soul...was mukhtar of the village.And then one day,he donated to us this ground...on which you stand, for a youth village.So, we began to build this place.And again it wasn't a matterof little cakes and music.It meant more sweat, more work.Look about you.You will see Arab children here.Three of them, grandsons of that same Kammal...the mukhtar who gave us this land.It grieves me that he isn't with us todayto see all this.But he's been gathered to the bosom of Allah.Speak always that name with respect.With us, instead,we have the son of Kammal, Taha...an honour to his father's memory.Raised part of the time in my house,with my own dear son, Ari...and with my dear daughter, Jordana,who sits beside him in this place.I want you to give particular attentionto what he's going to tell to you.Here is Taha, son of Kammal, since five years...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.Thank you, Barak Ben Canaan.Village president, Dr. Ernst Lieberman.In this valley of Jezreel,we dwell together as friends.It is natural that we should live in peace.Since even our words for itare almost exactly the same.We say salaam...and you, shalom.Let us seal our friendship foreverwith that most beautiful of Hebrew toasts.L'chaim, to life.L'chaim!Come on.Dov Landau.Immigration says you're legal,so we've no reason to keep you.The Jewish Agency sent a bus ticketand lunch money.You're assigned to Gan Dafna.You take my advice and go there.Don't hang around Haifa. You'll get in trouble.Don't wander into the Arab section.Or you'll run into the Mufti's gangstersand they'll kill you, son.They'll slit your throat.And keep away from the Irgun. And then, after the ghetto was destroyed? I hid in the sewers for five months.Eating what?When I couldn't sneak out at nightand steal garbage, I killed rats.And then one night they caught me. And they sent you to Auschwitz? Yes.To what work were you assigned in Auschwitz?I told you that twice already.It was mostly clean up. Cleaning up what? The camp area.That's all there was to do.That and working in the kitchens.And when Auschwitz was liberated,you walked to Germany?You asked me that already, too.May I talk with the young man for a moment?So you want to blow up British installationsfor the Irgun?Yes.You're an expert dynamiter, true?Just try me.There's still a point or twowe do not completely understand. Will you assist us in making them clear? Sure.And make certain to tell the truth?Why shouldn't I tell the truth?This is always hard to answer.First, I will ask you, please,to recreate for me again how it was in Auschwitz.Now, think most carefully about it,and describe it to me. Describe what? Whatever you like.For instance, how it was that peoplewere chosen to live or to be killed.First you undressed...and then they clipped your hair.And then you all lined up,and you went to the station room.So the way you remember it,they were men, women, children...all together and all naked.Yes.And then the doctors examined you...and told you what gate to take.There were three gates.If you were to be killed,then you went through the left gate.Which most of them did.Yes. Most.But if you were strong enough to work,then you went through the right gate.Which you did.Yes. And then they assigned you to... You said there were three gates.Who went through the third gate?Girls. All the girls? No.Only if they were young and pretty.What happened to them?The SS guards kept some of them.The rest were sent around to army camps...for the soldiers.You have a good memory.Now, those who wentthrough the left gate to be killed...how was the killing accomplishedin Auschwitz?They went in to take showers,, or , at a time.And the doors were locked.And then came the gas.Very professional. One thing I overlooked.You say you got this dynamiting experiencein the Warsaw Ghetto fighting Nazis.That's right.You blew up quite a few Naziswith this dynamite?All I could.Good.Now, return to Auschwitz, please.From the gas chambers, the bodies went where?The ovens.At Auschwitz,they had crematoriums only at the last.Before the installation of the ovens,what happened to the bodies?They buried them.How?In trenches and holes. And who dug the holes? I don't know.I ask you again, who dug the graves?I don't know.They had demolition squads.At least sometimes they did.To blow holes in the ground...then dump the bodies in.That is correct.Now may I tell you something, Dov Landau?At no time did the Jews use dynamitein the Warsaw Ghetto.They had no dynamite.Do you remember better now?Maybe.So it was not possible for you to learnthe use of dynamite in the Warsaw Ghetto.You learned about dynamite in Auschwitz...making mass graves to receivethe dead bodies of your people.True?Yes.Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them.And you saved your own lifeby working in that camp as a Sonderkommando. Correct? Yes.It was the duty of those Jewswho became Sonderkommandos...to shave the heads of other Jews.Yes.To remove dead bodies from the gas chambers.To collect gold fillings from their teeth.Yes!What could I do?We take into consideration that you wereless than  when you entered Auschwitz.Even so, we must have the truth.Is there anything else?Yes.Then tell us.No, I won't tell you.Please, don't make me tell you.Kill me. I don't care. I won't tell you. Tell us.They used me.They used me...like you use...a woman.You will repeat for me the following words:""I, Dov Landau...I, Dov Landau...""...do give my body, my brain,my soul and my being...do give my body, my brain,my soul and my being...""...without reservation or qualification...without reservation or qualification...""...to the freedom fighters of the Irgun.to the freedom fighters of the Irgun.""Under torture, even unto death...Under torture, even unto death...""...I will never divulge the nameof a fellow member of the Irgun.""I will never divulge the nameof a fellow member of the Irgun. You wanted me? Yes. So? I've got to see Akiva. Where is he?We tell Haganah where our leaders are hiding?Forget Haganah. Akiva's my uncle.And Barak Ben Canaan is your father.We trust him as we trust the Grand Mufti. His son's different? Just tell Akiva and let him decide. I don't even know if he's in Jerusalem. So tell him anyway.If I can find him,where can I telephone you this evening?I'll be here on the terrace from : on.Do you like the view here?Mr. Ben Canaan. Are we both eating alone? I am. Or I was. Won't you sit down? Thanks.I know all the good things on that menu.May I order for you? Would you like a drink? I had one at the consulate.I had another one when I came to my room.Have another one. Dry martini. Two very dry martinis.Excuse me, sir.I'll take the hors d'oeuvres, clear soup...fillet of sole...salad...and some of your very good Chablis.We'll order dessert later.Yes, sir.What were you doing at the consulate today?I've asked them to help me find Karen's father.Yes, the girl. Please forget what I said...about getting hystericalover the life of one child.I didn't mean it.I know you didn't.What happens if you find out her father's dead?Then I'll take her back to America with me.If she likes it there, I may adopt her.Won't your husbandhave something to say about that?My husband was killed a year ago...in a border skirmishnear the Sheikh Hussein bridge.You mean, here in Palestine?He was a news photographercovering the Near East.About the girl's father, if you like,I can put some of our Haganah boys on it.The British High Commissioner to Palestine.Taken over the whole south wing of the hotelin British general headquarters. Don't you feel uncomfortable here? I guess I'm as safe here as any place else.Besides, I spent  months in prison.Tell me about yourself.Where do you come from?I don't come from anywhere. I'm a sabra.A nativeborn Palestinian.My father was born in Russia.He has a farm near Moshav Yad EI. Do you like farms? I was raised on one.I'd like to show you ours.That'll be a little difficult.I've rented a car and I'm drivingto Gan Dafna tomorrow to visit Karen.That's only a few miles past Yad EI.I'm going up myself in the morning.Do I know you well enough to ask you for a lift?I think so. My name is Kitty. Ari.Thank you.I'll teach you a Hebrew toast. L'chaim!I know it. To life.Good for you.A year's a long time in the life of a pretty woman.Have you found another man? Nothing serious. Why not?Many reasons.One of them is that my husband's workfilled his whole life.I presume that's good,at least most men seem to think so.But I feel a man who has nothing but his workis only half a man.And you want a whole one?Exactly.The other half of his life must be a woman.What else?What else?Excuse me, sir. Telephone for you, call, please.Excuse me. I'll be right back.Come with me.Now? I have to go back to the terrace. I want... You want to arrange to have us followed.Let's go.Ari.Come in.Sit down.You must have some tea.There's an extra glass around here somewhere.You look better than ever, Uncle Akiva.It's an active life.You've been active yourself recently.This Exodus businessshows in your heart you're really an Irgunist.Two hundred pounds of dynamite?Immediately,the British draw proper conclusions.Now, it's no accidentthat brings you here tonight. May I speculate? Of course.The Irgun has been blowing uptoo many British installations.We behave rudely to our British guests.So the leading intellectuals of the Haganah,after endless meetings and much debate...have at last reached a decision. Correct? It's close.They say, ""Send Ari Ben Canaan"".""The old criminal's getting soft in the head"".""He loves the boy.Maybe Ari can stop his indelicate activities."" Also correct? Also.But they want something more.If the UN votes for Partition,we'll have the Arab world on our backs.Our only hope is an alliancebetween Irgunand Haganah.An alliance to fight? Of course.The minute Haganah adopts our policyof fighting instead of talking...an alliance between us becomes automatic.You're not being fair.When it comes to fighting,Haganah has lost more lives than Irgun.We fight to defend ourselves, or to capturepositions that we can occupy and hold.When you attack it's just to spread terror.Your duty is done.You have given me the official line.But what about you, Ari?Forget Haganah for one moment,and tell me what you think.I think these bombings and these killingshurt us with the United Nations.A year ago we had the respectof the whole world.Now, when they read about us,it's nothing but terror and violence.It's not the first time this happens in history.I don't know of one nation,whether existing now or in the past...that was not born in violence.Terror, violence, death.They are the midwiveswho bring free nations into this world.Compromisers like the Haganahproduce only abortions.Before you have a country,you have to have people.That's the job we've done.Tens of thousands of people smuggled in...with the whole British Navyblockading the coast.The population we've builtis our most valid argument for independence.How can we ask the UN for a just decision...when we keep blowing up thingslike a bunch of anarchists?You have just used the words ""a just decision.""May I tell you something?Firstly...justice itself is an abstraction...completely devoid of reality.Second, to speak of justice and Jewsin the same breath...is a logical uncertainty.Thirdly...one can argue the justiceof Arab claims on Palestine...just as one can arguethe justice of Jewish claims.Fourthly...no one can say the Jews have not had...more than their share of injusticethese past  years.I therefore say, fifthly...let the next injusticework against somebody else for a change.You just changed the subject on me.You noticed.I suppose that means more bombingsand more killings?I'll put it this way.Let the National Committee keep on tryingto talk the British out of Palestine.We have no objections.We will continue to bomb them out. Now tell me, how is your mother? She's fine.And little Jordana?Little Jordana just won her secondmarksmanship medal with the Palmach.And that young rascal, David Ben Ami,she's still interested?She can't wait till he gets back from Cyprus.And Barak...still counts my name among the deadon Yom Kippur?Ten years.It's a long time to be deadto the only family you have.Doesn't he understandI must work for Israel in my way...just as he works for it in his?You can't talk to him about it. I've tried.Of course.It's not much of a home, is it?With only Rose's samovar to make a memory real.Every time I come home,I stop here to look for a minute. You want to look with me? Sure.It's beautiful!The Valley of Jezreel.If you dug straight down far enough there,you'd find the ruins of Meggido.You'd find the very same paving stonesthat Joshua walked on when he conquered it.That's Abu Yesha. That's an Arab village.To the left is Gan Dafna. Do you know your Bible? In a Presbyterian sort of way.That's Mount Tabor.I remember.Where Deborah gathered her armies.That's where she stood when she watchedBarak march out to fight the Canaanites.""So Barak went down from Mount Tabor,and , men with him.""It's in the Book of Judges.The Canaanites had  iron chariots...but Barak had men., years ago.That's when the Jews first came to this valley.It wasn't just yesterday or the day before.Isn't your father's name Barak?In Russia, he was Yakov Rabinski.But when he came here,he took the name of Deborah's general.He called himself Barak Ben Canaan.Barak, the son of Canaan, and this valleybecame a Jewish land once again.He can give you the date every clumpof trees was planted there, to the month.Don't get excited.We're not debating now.I'll grant anything you say.I just wanted you to know that I'm a Jew.This is my country.I do know. I understand.Sometimes it's not that easy.It's the easiest thing in the world, Ari.All these differences between peopleare made up.People are the same,no matter what they're called.Don't ever believe it.People are different.They have a right to be different.They like to be different.It's no good pretendingthe differences don't exist, they do.They have to be recognized and respected.I recognize them. I respect them.Don't you understandthat you make me feel like a Presbyterian...when you can't, for just a minute or two,forget that you're a Jew?You're wrong, Ari.There are no differences.Ari, my boy.Papa, this is Mrs. Fremont.Shalom, Mr. Ben Canaan.Welcome to Yad EI, Mrs. Fremont.If you'll excuse me, I will tell your mother.Mama! Mama, where are you? I'm here, Barak. Have you hurt yourself? No. Ari is home. Ari? He's downstairs! Wait a minute. He's got a girl with him. A girl? An American girl. How do you know she's American?Sarah, I travel. I can recognize national types. What is her name, Barak? Mrs. Fremont.Mrs? So, where is her husband? Why does she go chasing after my Ari? Whether she's chasing him, I don't know.If you ask me, ""Is Ari chasing her?""Frankly, that is a possibility.For you maybe. Not for my Ari.Better stop talking like a goat.My Ari comes home and there's not a thingin the house to eat, not a bite.Hello! Rebecca.Now, say ""ah.""Yes? What a nice surprise. Tell my daughter, Jordana.Of course.No trouble at all.There. You're all right.Jordana, your brother Ari is at Yad EI,I just spoke to your papa.Ari? Take this for me.Now, young ladies and gentlemen...can you give me a little style?It's not fair keeping David in Cyprus so long.He could be doing something just as importantright here in Palestine.That's exactly what he says.But he tells me in his letterthat he may be gone another year.I know Haganah would call him back,if you would only use your influence.Any girl that falls in love with a Palestinian boyhas a long wait coming. A nice piece of strudel, Mrs. Fremont? I couldn't.Mrs. Fremont, you're a very pretty girl,but you could stand a little weight on you.Also your colour is not too good.If it wasn't for me, David wouldn't be in Cyprusworking for Haganah.He wanted to join the Irgun. You know that.I saw Uncle Akiva in Jerusalem.He sends you his love.You will not mention that name in my house.Father, he's all alone. He wants to forget what happened... To me, he is dead.At this moment when the very existenceof a free Israel hangs by a thread...before the UN, he presents us to the worldlike a bunch of murderers! He has a right to do... He is dead!I don't remember his name,I don't remember his face, he is dead!Barak.I have to get to Gan Dafna, now.That is if you are ready, Mrs. Fremont? You should see it before dark. Sorry you have to leave so soon. Maybe I'll wrap your strudel. No, don't bother.Goodbye, Mrs. Ben Canaan.And thank you for the good food.Bye. I hope you'll come back soon.The next time maybe a little hungrier. Goodbye. Goodbye.Barak, you should be ashamed of yourself,in front of a stranger.And do you know something else?I've been elected to the Rooms Committee,Bungalow . Already? Yes. You remember Edna, the girl with freckles? I think so.She's helping me with Hebrew,so I can catch up with the others. Hebrew? Yes. We have a language of our own now.And there's something else, too.When you're , you join the Palmach.They're soldiers, and everybody joins, also girls.I didn't show you the statue of Dafna.She was a young soldier.The Arabs captured her and they tortured herto find out things from her.But she wouldn't tell.So they sent her back to Yad Elin a sack tied to the back of a mule.They cut off her hands and her feet,and they gouged out her eyes.But she wouldn't tell them anything. She was very young. Seventeen.She and Ari Ben Canaan were in love.They grew up together.They were sweethearts all their lives.That's why Ari never got married.They named the village after her.And there's something else, too.Dr. Lieberman knows my father.I mean, he's read my father's books.He knows who my father is.That's wonderful. We have to go to supper now. I'm sorry, I couldn't eat a thing. I had too much at Yad EI. Then I'll come back afterwards.You're just going to love it here, Kitty.What's the matter? You act like a stranger.I feel like one.I guess I'd feel the same way, too,if I suddenly found myself in Indiana.You just don't understand us yet.Stop saying that.I can understand just as well as you can.I didn't come here to fight with you.I have to get to Jerusalem.I came to say goodbye.Ari.What?I had an accident on the road today.It wasn't your fault...but I'm going to drive more carefullyfrom now on. You don't really mean that. I do.You were right.We are different.I've been feeling the difference all afternoon.I feel...outside.The way your mother and father...They were perfectly charming,I don't mean that, but...the way they looked at me,the way your sister talks to me...It doesn't make any sense to discuss it,no sense at all.If it doesn't make any sense to discuss it,we'll just forget it.If I get any word on the girl's father,I'll let you know. Goodbye.Goodbye. Hello. Hello. How have you been? Fine, thank you. Hello.Karen, you do understandthat it's been a long time since you've seen him.He may have changed so much,you won't recognize him. I'll recognize him. Good. Doctor? Yes? Dr. Engel, Mrs. Fremont. Good day. And Karen. How do you do? The young lady understands, does she not? Yes, we told her everything.That's good.

I can show you...That town is surroundedby , British soldiers.,. , are pulling out tomorrowfor Jerusalem.Acre isn't a prison, it's a fortress.It hasn't been successfully attackedsince the Crusades.He picks a place in the middle of an Arab city,surrounded by the British Army...and says to us, ""Go fight.""Napoleon bombarded it for  days.Napoleon didn't have  men inside. You have. What about the  Arabs in that prison? We waste Irgun blood to free Arabs?If you turn  Arabs loose, they are goingto run in  different directions.Each'll have a detachmentof British soldiers on his tail.I will not listen.I do not trust anybody from the Haganah.If we can't trust each other,there'll be no Israel, even if Partition is voted.Akiva is Ben Canaan's own blood.This is no trap.How many Irgun does your plan call for?Twentysix, divided into four attack groups... and Dov Landau. What do you want with Dov Landau?Akiva's execution is six days away.We need a man inside Acre prisonby tomorrow night. Landau must surrender now. He'll be sentenced to death.Akiva is your uncle. Why don't you surrender?Because Landau will be sentencedwithin a few hours...and sent to Acre.It'd take weeks for me or anyone else.It must be Landau.If we can agree on a plan,and if Dov is necessary...and if we can find him,I will give him the choice.But I will not order him to do it.Please, tell us what you have in mind.Stars are British command posts.Numbers are outside detachments.Letters are inside groups.There is a Turkish bath housethat adjoins the south prison wall.Hammam alPasha, I know it.I'll take a man to the first detachment.You occupy the baths, move to the roof...and dynamite the prison wall here.Inside groups will move against the yardand the cell gates.

They'll never catch him.But I just keep thinkinghow scared he must be right now. Dov? Why, yes. He gets so scared.Why, inside, he's just scared all the time.You know, perhaps later on,we'll be able to get Dov to America, too.Kitty.I cannot go to America with you.I must stay here.Mrs. Fremont.Will you come to the hospital right away?It's an emergency. Please, hurry.A British search party has just turnedYad El upside down. Mother telephoned. They must be coming here next. We're almost finished.We must get him out of here.His right lung is punctured.If he's moved, the chances are  to he'll haemorrhage, and that would mean death.Of course, you're his sister, Jordana.It's for you to decide.No stranger has been here.However, everything is open to you.We are happy to accommodate.Sir. Mr. Coats. Quite an arsenal they've got piled up here. Pretty little collection.What's wrong?Nothing's wrong, but you must lie still.But I'm the only doctor they had.You can't leave all these childrenwithout a doctor.Don't worry, children, I'll be back.Dr. Lieberman's been arrested.They found weapons in Gan Dafna.Here's the adrenalin, they have no plasma.How is he?I opened the wound. It's draining.Will he live?I don't know.His temperature's .If it keeps going down,we may have the infection checked.If not, it means it's spreadingand forming pockets all through the chest cavity.When the Syrian Arabs murdered my fatherin his own mosque...Ari's father saved my life and my heritage.Ari and I used to live together in Yad EI.We shared the same room.To me, his house was life itself.Now to think that...my house may become his tomb.I can't find his pulse.Norway votes...for Partition.Pakistan...against. Who cares? How is it now? for Partition,  against, and  abstaining.If we get over the next , I think we're in.Republic of Panama...for.The Republic of Paraguay...votes...for Partition.The Republic of Peru...for.The Philippine Republic votes...for.We've got twothirds. I'm going to announce it! But we haven't got the final vote yet. What's the difference? We won!The Polish People's Republic votes...for.Although the vote is not yet complete,I can now tell you...that in  months and  daysfrom this moment...on May ......the British will leave Palestine forever!Please, don't make a demonstration yet.Because I've still to read this statementfrom the National Committee.""The final vote of the United Nationson the question of the Partition of Palestine...""...into an independent Jewish stateand an independent Arab state...""...is as follows:"" for...""... against,  abstentions.""We would wish the hour of parting between us...and England...to be one of honour.We must record that in most instances...British soldiers carried outthe unrelenting policy of their government...with tact and compassion.There are many cases on recordof British soldiers and sailors...risking their lives to save Jewish refugees.And to the Arab population of Jewish Palestine,we make the following appeal:The Grand Mufti has asked youeither to annihilate the Jewish population...or to abandon your homes and your lands...and to seek the weary path of exile.We implore you...remain in your homes...and in your shops...and we shall work together as equals...in the free state of Israel!What's wrong? You've won your freedom. I've lost mine. We never had freedom, you or I.All our lives we've been under British rule.We'll be equal in the free state of Israel.The resolution guarantees it.Guarantees are one thing, reality's another.They've made my lands and village part of Israel...These are still your lands. They always will be.I'm a minority.We've always been friends in this valley, Taha.Minority, majority,we've proved it makes no difference.If it makes no difference,why have you fought so hard?Because we had hundreds of thousandsof people with no other place to go. Where shall my people go? Why should they go anywhere?This is their home as well as ours.Don't you see? We have to prove to the worldthat we can get along together.If we don't, then the British are right,we cannot govern ourselves without them.Excuse me.All our lives we've understood each otherand loved each other.Now, when it means everything, I can't reach him.You'll make him understand, Ari. I know you will.You know, you're wonderful.I look at you...and I ask myself, what are you doing herein the middle of somebody else's fight?You should go back to America.You've had your civil war.I'm going to stay.I'm going to stay as long as you'll have me.I love you, Kitty.My father gave them the landupon which Gan Dafna stands.My children go to school at Gan Dafna.I am the mukhtar of this villageand will not attack.We know you are the mukhtar.Understand the Grand Muftihas publicly committed himself...and every Arab man, woman and child to die...rather than accept the partitioning of Palestine.His Holiness does not recognizethe decision of a few elderly gentlemen...at Flushing Meadows,who call themselves the United Nations.As you are a Moslem,you cannot recognize it either. What does this have to do with attacking? Gan Dafna commands the Jezreel valley.The Mufti must pass through this valleyon his way to Safed.He's made Safed his provisional capitaluntil the last Jew is exterminated. There are , Jews in Palestine. Temporarily.The Grand Mufti was our guest in Berlinduring the war.Since I and my group of friendsare now his guests...we have placed our experiencein handling Jews entirely at his disposal.I have  Arab storm troopers in my command.You will supply  menby tomorrow at midnight to join them.We will give you the arms.My people are shepherds and farmers,not fighters.The  men of whom I spokewere trained by myself, personally.They will see that your villagers fight like lions.I'm leaving three of my officersand six of my men behind...to assist you in gathering your forces together.My village is just as well situatedto control the valley as Gan Dafna.Must we slaughter defenceless childrenfor what we don't need?We've chosen Gan Dafnabecause we want a quick victory.I'm not going to take chances.Well, you must now excuse me.I have to deliver a message from the Muftito the British commander at Fort Esther.I'm travelling under a flag of truce.I shall return later.We'll be your guests tonight.I understand you have other guests in the house. A Jewish couple. The woman is an American.See to it that they are here when I return.I wish to interrogate them.Personally. Ari, you must leave here right away. Why?Don't ask why. Leave. Don't let anyone see you. Go through the olive grove. What happened?You must evacuate Gan Dafnaby midnight tomorrow. I don't understand. Don't ask questions, just do it.If the children aren't out of this valley,they will be butchered like sheep.If the Mufti's men are in the houseor if they're attacking Gan Dafna, tell me.Haven't I told you enough already?Do you want me to dishonour myself completely?Goodbye.They're the same gangsterswho murdered your father. You can't get involved with them. Ari, I know what I'm doing.We grew up as brothers.If there's trouble with the Mufti,let's face it together, as always.I'll get word to the Palmach.We'll defend Abu Yesha and Gan Dafnainstead of surrendering them.I cannot do it.Today, more than ever before,I realize that I'm a Moslem.I cannot go against my own people.I cannot kill another Arab.If you were ever my friend,prove it now by leaving this house.May Allah watch over you all the days of your life. Who goes? Dov Landau.I knew they wouldn't catch you. Who's in charge? Jordana Ben Canaan.Only, she isn't here now.She went to Fort Estherto try to make them give our guns back. Have you got headquarters set up here? In the dining hall.Don't hold a Molotov like that.Here, hold it like this.We've less than  heavy machine gunsin the country.Most of our ammunitionisn't accurate beyond  yards.Now, the Palmach have about , other arms...and the Irgun, another ,. From now on, we work together. Something coming through.Haganah Safed calling.""We've had an Arab uprising in progresssince sundown.""We have  rifles...""... homemade Stens...""...one machine gun and one mortar...""...plus handmade grenades.""We still hold the centre of the city...""...but we're heavily outnumbered."" Ari, how are you? I'm fine. How many guns have you got? Eight.And about  Molotovs.The British confiscated the rest.I know. I heard.Jordana went to Fort Estherto try to get them back.There's a detachment of Palmachs on the way.But the Jerusalem road has been cutin a dozen places.I sneaked ahead to let you know.The order is for every kibbutz and moshavand village to fight to the end.Nothing's to be surrendered. Is the transmitter working? Yes.Then send this:""Gan Dafna expects an attack in forceby tomorrow night.""If the Palmach is on the way, tell them to hurry.""We have  children here and eight guns.""That's all.Keep on sending that.The commander refuses to return our weapons.He said it would only provoke violence.And he won't interfere in local problems,except to punish troublemakers.I suppose that means us,if we try to defend ourselves.They must know thatthe whole border's alive with armed Arabs.I think the Mufti's men havetaken over Abu Yesha.Taha warned us to evacuate herebefore midnight tomorrow.How many children do we have here under ?About .We'll have to get them to Beth Amal tonight...and secretly, so the Arabs don't know.We'll go around the valley instead of through it.That's near the border, but we must risk it.We'll go through Ein Orand down the other side of Mount Tabor.You can't go down the other side of Taborin daytime, much less at night.You'll kill half of them.I'd rather lose half of them therethan all of them here.With luck we'll be back by sunrise.That means the older childrenmust handle things until we get back. What if they attack tonight? That's a risk we'll have to take.Dov, you organize outside the fence.Jordana, you take the inner area.Make it look as thoughwe've got , people here.Let's get to work.Get dressed. Hurry up.Get up, get dressed. Report to the dining hall.Will you help me?I want you to stay here.If anything happens, they'll need a nurse.Have you forgottenevery yearold girl in Gan Dafna...is a nurse, and a good one?Stay here, anyway.I don't want you mixed up in this.Either I'm with you, or I'm not with you.This is your choice,and this is the time to make it, right now.All right, you come along, then.That's a Haganah order.Now...I want you to walk two by two,holding hands so that nobody gets lost.We're going very close to the border.So from when we leave...until the time we get to Beth Amal,nobody says a word.Nobody coughs, nobody sneezes,nobody cries, nobody even whispers.Do you understand? Will you promise? We will. No, say it. We promise. Not one word. Not one word.Mr. Ben Ami, how many men did you bring?Only two to a truck,but from the outside it looks like an army.Where is Jordana?David! I'm so glad to see you. Halt! Stay where you are. It's me, Dov.Watch out. What are you doing out here? Sixty Palmachniks just came. I know, I heard the trucks. So you can come back now.No, I don't go backuntil somebody relieves me of this position.Stay down.There are Arabs out there.Ari said they won't attack until tomorrow night.I killed one about three hours ago.Down there.Dov...you have a beautiful name.Sometimes I whisper it to myself. You'd better go back. When you do.I'm  years old now. I'm not little anymore. You shouldn't have come here in the first place.But, Dov, you're always fighting.And you're always in a placewhere you might be killed.If anything should happen to youbefore I told you how much I love you...I just wouldn't want to live anymore.Please, love me.I'm not afraid. Honest, I'm not.When things are all over, I'm going to marry you.You'll be Mrs. Dov Landau.You're going to have respect. They will tip their hats when you go by. And I will smile. I told you to go back twice already. Dov!From now on, you do what I say.You understand?Now, keep down.Be careful. Take cover wherever you can.Shalom, Dov. I've come to relieve you. Is Ari back? Yes.He got the children safely to Beth Amal.It's been very quiet the last few hours. Shalom.Shalom.We are going to attack Abu Yeshabefore they move.Good. We'll never be strongerthan we are right now. Have you seen Karen? I sent them all to bed hours ago. What's my assignment? Patrol Gan Dafna while we move out.Let's be sure they don't surprise uswhile we surprise them.David will jump them from behind...and my group will attackdirectly through the olive grove.David, you'd better take Jordana with you,she knows the village.Nothing seems to be moving over there.The muezzin hasn't calledfor the morning prayers, either.Cover us.Somebody come and help me cut him down.What's the matter?This is Taha...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.And this is Karen...Secretary of the Rooms Committee,Bungalow , Gan Dafna.We have no kadi...to pray for Taha's soul.And we have no rabbi...to pray over Karen.Taha should have lived a long life...surrounded by his people and his sons.And death should have come to him...as an old friend...offering the gift of sleep.It came, instead, as a maniac.And Karen, who loved her life...and who lived it as purely as a flame,why did God forget her?Why did she have to stumbleonto death so young?And all alone?And in the dark?We of all people...should no longer be surprisedwhen death reaches out to us.With the world's insanityand our own slaughtered millions...we should be used to senseless killing.But I am not used to it.I cannot and will not get used to it.I look at these two people,and I want to howl like a dog.I want to shout ""murder""...so that the whole world will hear itand never forget it.It's right that these two peopleshould lie side by side in this grave...because they will share it in peace.But the dead always share the earth in peace.And that's not enough.It's time for the living to have a turn.A few miles from here,people are fighting and dying...and we must join them. But I swear...on the bodies of these two people...that the day will comewhen Arab and Jew will share...in a peaceful life...this land that they have always shared in death.Taha, old friend...and very dear brother.Karen...child of light...daughter of Israel...Shalom."

He said, ""Snowden"". Snowden's dead. Why is he talking to a dead man? He's Captain Yossarian. He's crazy. Who says so? I do. Cos I hate that son of a bitch? Who? Colonel Cathcart. I didn't ask you, Orr. Colonel Cathcart isn't here. Who said anything about him? Colonel Korn isn't here. Who said anything about him? What son of a bitch do you hate? What son of a bitch is here? You don't make any sense. You've got a persecution complex. Damn right. You admit it!I admit I'm being persecuted.By them! Who specifically is ""them""? All of them! Who do you think? No idea!

Then why are they shooting at me? They're shooting at everyone. What difference does that make? Suppose everyone thought like you? I'd be a fool to think different. You need your head examined.There's nothing wrong with it. Look at it once, will you? Yossarian, your head is OK.Please, don't do that. Doc? What? I want you to ground me. Don't start that again.Doc, I don't want to fly any more.It's dangerous.Listen, I told you...Let's get out of here.I've flown  missions. Now that nuthas raised the number to .In any other outfit I would've beenrotated after . Help me out.I'm due for rotation myselfin a couple of months,if I don't cause troubleor break any rules.One of the rules says I can't groundanyone just because he asks me to.Can you ground someone who's crazy?Of course. The rules sayI have to ground anyone who's crazy.I'm crazy! Ask anybody.Ask Nately, Dobbs, McWatt... Orr, tell him! Tell him what? Am I crazy? He's crazy. He won't fly with me.I'd take good care of himbut he won't. He's crazy, all right. See that? They all say I'm crazy. They're crazy. Ground them. Why don't they ask me to? Because they're crazy! Of course they're crazy.You can't let crazy people decidewhether you're crazy or not. Is Orr crazy? Of course he is.He has to be, if he keeps flyingafter all those close calls. Then why not ground him? He has to ask me. That's all he's gotta do? Yes. And then you can ground him? No. Then I cannot ground him. There's a catch. A catch?Sure, Catch. Anyone who wantsto get out of combatisn't really crazy,so I can't ground him.Let me see if I got this straight.In order to be grounded,I've got to be crazyand I must be crazy to keep flying.But if I ask to be grounded,that means I'm not crazy any more and I have to keep flying.

Where did you get the egg?In Malta, sir, where there areenough chickens to lay fresh eggsfor every officer in the squadron,at five cents apiecefrom the mess fund.With a clear profitof two cents per egg.For whom?For whomever sells the eggsto the mess.And who may that be, Milo? Oranges from Marrakech, pecans... Pecans?And in Palermo, ten thousand gallonsof the finest Italian olive oil.The Sicilians need blankets.It would be a fair trade.There's an interested partyin Sardinia.All we need is the cooperationof the countries we're dealing with. What countries? The African nations, sir,in the Greater Mediterranean area.What we need is an additionalassignment of personnel,a little time and a plane. What plane? One of ours, sir. If I had one,I could get the gasoline to Maltaand bring the eggs back.All right.And if I was taken off combat dutyuntil I get this into operation...But...I know I'm justan acting mess officer, Colonel,but it requires my full attention.It's to everyone's benefit. Take whatever you need. Thank you.What I hope to do is to give the menthe finest cuisine in the world. Isn't that something to shoot at? Yes, Milo, it certainly is.With your permission, I'd like toshow you something I've had printed. What is it? Just an idea, sir. It's a share. A share?

Major Duluth is dead.I'm distraught to hear that.You may be distraught but he's dead.Shot down over Perugia today.That'll teach him to go on missionswhen he should be in the office. I don't see... We need a new squadron commander.And you're the only major availableon our headquarters staff.No, Major is my name, not my rank.That's close enough for me, Major.Consider yourself a major.I don't know anythingabout being a commander.We all haveto make sacrifices, Major.Sir, I'm in Billeting and Laundry!I know that, sir, but we allhave to do our part, I guess.Well, I don't like my part.Sergeant, I'm going to takethe rest of the afternoon off,and lie down in my tentand think about things.Sir, there's someonewaiting to see you. Now? Yes, sir. Who is it? Captain Tappman, Group Chaplain.What does he want?Something to do withCaptain Yossarian.Look, Sergeant...My job is tough enoughwithout having to deal all the timewith people who want something. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir.I suppose you're wonderingabout this.No, sir.It's not my place to wonder. Did you know people stare at me? No, sir.They're thinking,""Who is that Major Major,""that he gets to be commanderwithout ever having flown?"" I don't think people think that. Well, they are.When I have this on,they don't know who I am.Did you know, in the Middle Ages,princes and kingswould put on disguisesand walk around their subjects? I didn't know that. You don't know everything. No, sir. Why did they do that? Why did who do what?Why did they walk around in disguise?How the hell am I supposed to know?I'm not some historian or anything.I'm just a guy trying to do his job.Good afternoon, Sergeant. What is it now? What do I do with the Chaplain?I don't want anyone to comeand see me while I'm in my office.What do I say to peoplewho want to see you? Tell them to wait. For how long? Until I've left. Then what? I don't care. I send them in after you've left?You won't be here, then, will you?Also, I don't want you coming inwhile I'm in,asking meif there's anything you can do.When should I askif there's anything I can do?When I'm not there! What do I do then? Whatever has to be done.I'm sorry to have to talkto you this way, but I have to. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Thank you, for everything. Thank you, sir. The Major will see you now, Father. Thank you. You don't have to call me Father. Sergeant Towser speaking.Will you go in?Yes, sir. I have it here, sir. There's no one here. Where?In Major Major's office. When? When you go to see him.What I mean is you can't see himwhen he's there,when he's in his office.I've tried. Several times.When can you see him? Ever?Yes, indeed, you can see him,when he isn't there.That is, he'll see you, all right,but only in his office,and only when he's not there.The other times, when he's in...he's not thereto be seen.Except when he's out.What the hellare you talking about, Father?Get your ass in here, Padre.Are you describingsome mystical experience?There are some peculiar thingshappening.You haven't had any ecstatic visions,have you?Didn't see a burning bush,hear voices, anything like that? Nothing as extraordinary as that. I hope not.We have to keep our supernaturalepisodes down to a minimum. We have a war to win. Absolutely, sir. May I ask where we're going? Where we're going?You are goingto Colonel Cathcart's office. Now? That's the general idea, Padre.Is there anything wrong?Have I done anything?I don't know. Are you andCaptain Yossarian up to something? I don't know what you mean. Then who does? I don't know, sir. You don't know much about anything. No, sir. Sir? What is it?It's not necessary to call me Father.I'm an Anabaptist.Thanks for the correction. Thanksfor setting me straight on that. I just thought you'd like to know. You're a captain, right? I'm a Lieutenant Colonel. Correct? Yes, sir, it is.Then I can call you anything I want,unless you have some objections. Out! Thank you, sir.Sir, do you think now...? Morning. Anything I can get you? Morning, Lieutenant. What? Do you need any supplies? No.Whisky, silk stockings,building materials, fresh fruit?The Colonel loves fresh fruit.What about religious supplies?I know I can get hold of an entireshipment of religious relics.Blessed by the Pope himself.The stuff includes the bonesof some of your top saints. That's very kind of you. If you need anything, ask for Milo. I was never issued a blanket. Anything at all, now!I think the Colonel wants to see me. He does? I believe so. I'm... Chaplain Tappman. You're Chaplain Tappman?Have a seat. I'll tell the Colonelyou're here, Father.It's not...You'd better get some dry things.I will. As soon as the Colonelis through with me.They just picked me upout of the sea. I drifted for almost three days. You should report to the hospital. You could catch pneumonia. Not me. This is my fourth time. How do you mean?I've put down in the Mediterraneanonce, once in the Adriatic,then I crashlanded one planeand I bailed out once. You're very lucky. That's what some folks say.Yossarian says they're gonna starttaking it out of my salary.He's a friend of mine.Do you know him? As a matter of fact... Captain Tappman! Perhaps you shouldn't fly any more. It's good practice. Tappman, the Colonel is a busy man. Yes, of course.We don't see much of youaround here lately.Well, sir, I try to stay outof the way as much as possible. I may make the men uncomfortable. Nonsense!I can't imagine any man not enjoyingthe benefits of your presence.Unless they're atheists. Not much chance of that, though. I don't know, sir. Isn't atheism against the law? No.It isn't?Then it's unAmerican, isn't it? I'm not sure. Well, I am.If I find any atheists on this base,you can bet they'll soonstart believing in something.That's not whyI called you in, Chaplain.I want you to take a look at this.Page .Don't read the whole thing. You canget the point from the photographs.There's a fullpage pictureof a colonel in Englandwhose chaplain conducts prayersbefore every mission.I see no reason whyThe Saturday Evening Postshould not be interestedin the story of my outfit.Think up some nice snappy prayersto send the men out feeling good.Can you do that? I'll try. Well, good! Let's get to it!Is there something else?Sir, it may be none of my business,but some of the men areparticularly upset about the factthat you keep raising the numberof missions they have to fly. You're right, Chaplain. I am, sir?That it's none of your business.And it's none of theirs either.Their business is to fly missions.Your business is to think ofsome catchy prayersthat'll get me into The SaturdayEvening Post. Good afternoon! Excuse me. Excuse me, Padre.He says the men are upset because Ikeep raising the number of missions.It's that Captain Yossarian. He'salways bitching and making trouble. What can we do about it? What would General Dreedle do? He'd crush him. Tear him apart! Smack him in the face! Jab him in the kidneys!Kick him in the balls!Keep your head downbetween your legs.Try to breathe deeply and evenly.I'm sorry, Captain.I know how that must feel. I don't think so. Try not to talk.Just think about nice things.Think about how lovely it is here,how lovely it would be if someonedidn't always try to spoil it. Why do you always try to spoil it? Because I love you.I know that, Captain. I know that.But this is wartime.We've got a job to do, Soldier.We just can't give in to ourselves.Think how it is for me.One of a handful of womenon an island with thousands of men.Men who are giving up their livesfor our country, for me.Think about... Captain Yossarian! What are you doing? Listen, I'm gonna die.What is it?What's the matter?The name of the town is Ferraraand it's right around here.It's a very pretty town,on the coast. You all right? It's her, it's her! Who? Dreedle's WAC!If you do your job well, there won'tbe anything left of it, anyway.Intelligence reports indicate youshouldn't have to worry about flak.We were hoping for somenew recon photos of the area.Unfortunately they haven't arrivedbut then, no news is good news.You may ask how come we're outto destroy a town with no industry,no enemy bases,no strategic value to anyone.As you were. Good morning, gentlemen.We're honoured to have GeneralDreedle at today's briefing.Don't pay any attention to me.Just carry on. Don't pay any attention to Dad. Will you clam up?Don't call me Dad. Go ahead with your briefing, Major. Yes, well... Thank you, sir.I was just tellingthe men here that... Don't tell me. Tell them! Tell the men, Danby.Yes. I was just explainingwhy we're going to obliterate... What about a chair? Sir? A chair. I beg your pardon, General?A chair!Doesn't anyone know what a chair is?!Can't you see a lady is standing?A chair for Dad's gir... for the lady!Carry on.We're now going to synchroniseour watches.We've all done this before, so Idon't think we'll have a problem.If everyone will be kind enough tolook down at his watch, we'll begin.It is now : hours minus ..., , ...Somebody's gonna get it!All right, at ease!There'll be no more moaningin this outfit.The next man who moansis going to be very sorry.Who is this man? Major Danby, sir. Danby. DANBY. Take him out and shoot him. Sir? I said take him out and shoot him. Take Major Danby out and shoot him.I think you'd better wait a minute,Dad. I don't think you can shoot him.Why the hell can't I? Why not?You mean I can't shootwhoever I want to? Is that a fact? I'm afraid it is, Dad.You think you're pretty smart,don't you?Just because my daughter married youfor God knows what bizarre reason...No, Dad, it's just...Let the insubordinate son of a bitchgo, but get him out of here. Better do something. All right, men. I think we...owe a vote of thanks to the Generalfor visiting us and cheering us up.In his honour, I'd like to make anannouncement which may interest you.I know you're all anxiousto do your part...Here it comes.As of now,the number of missions requiredbefore you are eligible for rotationis raised to .I know we'll all do our best.Why are you smiling,you silly bastard? Now I won't have to go home. You what?I can stay.I don't have to leave her. What are you saying? I love her.I do. I really do. I've never feltlike this, not even for my mom.Men don't fall in lovewith girls like that.Men always fall in lovewith girls like that.One or the other.I'm gonna take her backto Long Island with me.You don't really love her.You think you love her.How can you tell the differencebetween loving herand thinking he's in love? You have to be objective. Who's objective? I am cos I'm not in love with her. You mean you think you're not. That's right. So how can you tell the difference? Wait a second... Look! Look what Aarfy's got. Say goodbye, McWatt. Come on!My dear...My dear, we had a lovely day.Did you see what he did?Make him tell you what he did. What'd you do, Aarfy? Nothing. Nice girl. Very nice girl.She wanted us to go home with her.She was gonna show us a good time.We had a good time. We sawthe Colosseum and other swell sights. Why didn't you take her home? I can't take advantage of a kid. Old Aarfy's got some principles. You've got a diseased mind.She just wanted to jumpin the sack with somebody.She's mixed up.I gave her a good talking to.He did!I straightened her outand sent her home. You crazy bastard! You're beneath contempt. He's got a dirty mind. I don't see it that way. They want us to go home with them. For how much? $! Who's the little runt?Nately's whore's kid sister.I wanna spend some time with my girl.I'll pay for all of us.Give her the  bucksand send the other two away.She'll be angry with mefor making her work.She said that if I really loved her,I'd sleep with the other two.I swear, you fellas...!Come on, Yossarian, let's go!Go on, you go. What's wrong? What isn't wrong? Two more missions and we go home. You know what's gonna happen.No. A whole bunch of replacementpilots came into Naples yesterday. Who says? Milo.He just came from therewith loads of coconuts.We'll never see those replacements,or those coconuts.Cathcart wouldn't dareraise the number of missions again.Who's gonna stop him?Somebody will.Come on!Wait for me!All right. I want to get this clear.As I understand it,we're giving these men medalsfor doing a lousy job. Is that right?That's not quite the situation.When I want an answer from you I'lllook at you  as seldom as possible. I think I can explain it. You'd better.Yesterday's mission was to bomba town called Ferrara. Why Ferrara? What do you mean, ""Why Ferrara?"" Do you know what Ferrara is? It's a town on a hill. Do you know what's in that town? Five minutes to target. What's in it? Nothing.Nothing's in it.No Germans, no munitions,no railroad crossing,no harbour, nothing. Nothing at all? No. Except people. Italian people.And a monastery.Yossarian, maybe it's some kindof strategy thing. What the hell are we doing? It's not our business to ask. Whose business is it? Four minutes to target. Are you ready to take us in? Get ready to dump. We're not there yet! Get away from there, Aardvark!Come on, you'll screw upthe whole mission! Get ready to turn! What are you doing? Cut it out, Yossarian! Get ready to turn!A direct hit... on the ocean?Yes, sir. A marvellous bomb pattern.We have aerial photographsif you'd like to see them.We're decorating men who dropped tons of expensive bombs on the Mediterranean? If you consider the alternative...The alternative is that we takethe whole crew and shoot 'em. Might be a problem there, sir. All right, I know.If we can't shoot the bastards,we can courtmartial them,see that they rot in some stockade.We felt that a courtmartialmight get unavoidable publicity.If it got around that we used oneof our missions to bomb the ocean...You don't have to sayanything more, Colonel.""For distinguished duty in the faceof overwhelming... "" something... Odds. ""... odds,""this Air Medal is awardedto Captain JS... "" McWatt. ""... McWatt. ""Come on, come on.All right, McWatt.What are you waiting for, a kiss? Get back in there. And on the double!""For meritorious action""in the face of concentratedenemy fire, Captain... "" What's this? Come on, dumbo.Unless I miss my guess, Captain,you're out of uniform.What are you looking at?Get back in the car,you smirking slut.Why aren't you wearing clothes,Captain? I don't want to. What do you mean? Why don't you?I dunno. I just don't want to. Why is he naked? He's talking to you. Why is he naked, Major? Why is he naked, Sergeant?A man was killed in his planeand bled all over him.His clothes are in the laundry. Where are his other uniforms? In the laundry, sir. Where is his underwear? In the laundry, sir. That sounds like a lot of crap. It is a lot of crap, sir.Sir, this manwill be punished severely.What the hell do I care?If he wants to receive a medalwithout clothes on,what business is it of yours? My sentiments exactly, sir. Here's your medal, Captain. You're a very weird person. Thank you, sir. You are giving me this? Yes. Perché? Because you're beautiful,and because your name is Luciana.It was my mother's name.But my real name is Eleonora Rosanna.I only call myself Luciana.My motheronly called herself Luciana.Her real name was Eleonora Rosanna. I don't believe you. I don't blame you.What you get this for?Will you believe meif I tell the truth?I was awarded that particular medalfor killing fish. You have killed many fish? Yes, I am one of the biggest...I am the most renowned killer of fishin the US Army Air Force.I dance with youbut I won't let you sleep with me. Who asked you? You don't want to sleep with me? I don't wanna dance with you. You crazy? Watch where you put your hands, GI. My name is Yossarian.Watch where you put your hands,Yossarian.It's... What's his name, the new gunner? Snowden. I'm cold. OK. You're gonna be OK.Cold. Cold. There. Starting to hurt me.Hang on. I'll get you some morphine. You prick! Hi! What's up?It's good to see you.When did you get out of the hospital?We've got a couple of thingsto talk over.How you feeling? I'm sorry I didn'tvisit, but I've been in Naples. I wanna know about that parachute. What parachute?The one I use if I needto jump out of the plane.That parachute! You haveto remember that your parachutewas just one of  or  parachutestaken over by the Syndicate.I don't care about the Syndicate.I don't want your tomatoes!They're not my tomatoes, they're theSyndicate's tomatoes. Our tomatoes.Just as these are our statues.In fact, that's whereall the parachutes went.You traded my parachute for statues?No, in point of fact. I tradedour diesel engines for the statues. I don't have any engines! I said ""our"", not ""your"".I got the enginesfor two planeloads of lumber, pairs of shoesand the parachutes.The men aren't gonna be happyabout what you've been doing.Don't they understand? We're gonnacome out of this war rich.You're gonna come out rich.We're gonna come out dead! What does he want? Who?Hungry Joe. What is the matter? I got a feeling. I think it is. What? Come on. What is it?I don't knowbut if it's what I think it is...It's just McWatt.The bastard's been doing it to mefor months. He's jealous of her. Because she likes you better? She likes him better. Why doesn't she go out with him? Because she can't stand him! Good old McWatt. Why?He's carrying me on his manifest.Every time he goes up,he files my name as a passenger.I get my flight paywithout having to go up in a plane. Look! What is he saying?He's coming back! Who was it? Hungry Joe.We'll have to requisitiona new photographer from Group.Is there anythingI can do?McWatt's still up there. Doc Daneeka's up there, too. I'm right here.Come on down, McWatt.Probably afraid to come down.He knows the trouble he's in.He cut his engine.Why doesn't Daneeka jump?He's got a chute.I'm right here, Sergeant.I'm not in the plane.Jump, Doc, jump!Jump. Jump, Doc...Please, jump.Jump. Jump!Poor Hungry Joe. Poor McWatt. Poor Doc.Poor Doc.I'll need a full report on this,Captain Yossarian.I haven't seen you in some time.Not since...Snowden's funeral. Do you want to say something, sir? What?I just wonderedif you wanted to say anything.No, I didn't actually knowthe young fellow.It was his first mission.Did you know him, Danby?I don't think I ever heard the name.What was it?Snowden, I think.I'll just read something.Yes, you do that. Something wrong? No, I just thought I saw something. A naked man in a tree? Yes, that's it.That's just Yossarian.Well, in that case...""The Lord is my shepherd.""I shall not want. He maketh meto lie down in green pastures... "" I've been looking all over for you. You should've looked for me here.I don't want to butt in, but whyaren't you wearing your uniform?I don't want to.I want you to do something for me.I want to serve this to the men.Taste it and let me knowwhat you think. What is it? Chocolatecovered cotton. Are you crazy? No good? You didn't take the seeds out! Is it really that bad? It's cotton! They've got to learn to like it. Why? I saw an opportunityto corner the market in cotton.I didn't know there'd be a glut.I've got warehouses full of itall over Europe.People eat cotton candy. This isbetter, it's made out of real cotton. People can't eat cotton! They've got to, for the Syndicate.It will make them sick. Try ityourself if you don't believe me.I did, and it made me sick.Look at that. Looks like a funeral.They're burying the kidthat got killed in my plane. What happened to him? He got killed. What? I said he got killed.I'm sorry. He was your friend? Maybe. I don't know. He was very old. But he was a boy.He died.You don't get any older than that. Where do you work? I'm not a whore.I didn't say you were. I work in big American company. Me, too! You want to see me again? Why? Why not?You think I'm beautiful? I think you're perfect. That's not true.It is true.See this? Jesus, how did you...? Air raid. Germans? Americani.You do not want me now?What are you talking about?I want you now. I want you to marry me. You crazy. Why? You can't want to marry me. Why not? I'm not a virgin. So? Nobody wants a girl who isn't. I do. I wanna marry you. Not possible. Why not? Because you're crazy. Why am I crazy? Because you want to marry me.You won't marry me because I'm crazy.I'm crazy because I wanna marry you? You're crazy. Why?Because I love you.How can you love a girlwho is not a virgin?Because I can't marry you.Why you can't marry me?Because I'm not a virgin? No, because you're crazy! You're crazy! You all crazy! Why are we crazy?Because you don't knowhow to stay aliveand that's the secret of life.But we have a war to win.But America will lose the war.Italy will win it.America's the strongest nationon earth.The American fighting manis the best trained,the best equipped, the best fed...Italy, on the other hand, is oneof the weakest nations on earthand the Italian fighting manis hardly equipped at all.That's why my country is doing sowell while yours is doing so poorly.That's silly! First Italy wasoccupied by Germans and now by us. You call that doing well? Of course I do.The Germans are being driven outand we are still here.In a few years, you'll be goneand we'll still be here.Italy is a very poor, weak countryyet that is what makes us so strong,strong enough to survive this warand still be in existencelong after your countryhas been destroyed.What are you talking about?America's not going to be destroyed. Never? Well...Rome was destroyed.Greece was destroyed.Persia was destroyed.Spain was destroyed.All great countries are destroyed.Why not yours?How much longer do you thinkyour country will last? Forever? Forever is a long time, I guess. Very long. Please, we're talking. We go to bed now?Would you go put some clothes on?You're practically naked.I wish she wouldn'twalk around like that.It is her businessto walk around like that. But it's not nice. Of course it's nice.She's nice to look at.This life is not nice.I don't want her to do this. When we go to America, Nately? When we go to America, Nately?You will take her to America?Away from a healthy, active life?Away from good businessopportunities? Away from her friends? Don't you have any principles? Of course not. No morality? I'm a very moral man.And Italy is a very moral country.That's why we will certainlycome out on top againif we succeed in being defeated. You talk like a madman. But I live like a sane one.I was a Fascistwhen Mussolini was on top.Now that he has been deposed,I am antiFascist.When the Germans were here,I was fanatically proGerman.Now I'm fanatically proAmerica!You'll find no more loyal partisanin all of Italy than myself.You're a shameful opportunist!It's better to die on your feetthan to live on your knees.You have it backwards.It's better to live on your feetthan to die on your knees. I know. How do you know? Because I am  years old.How old are you?I'll be  in January.If you live.How are ya, how are ya?We gotta go back.All the leaves have been cancelled.Hello, my dear.You give me a dollar? I pay you backwhen we get to America.Just one... Just one.One! Gimme that.Come on, Dobbs.Milo's gonna fly us back. Why are the leaves cancelled? I don't know.Milo says the base is onsome kind of alert.Cathcart raisedthe number of missions to .He's mad because Captain Orrlost another airplane. Where? Ditched coming back from Bologna. Went down in the Mediterranean. AirSea Rescue out there?They picked up everybody but Orr.Will you fellas stay awayfrom the airstrip tonight? What for? Just do as I say. Stay in your tents. Why? There it is. What?Orr's plane!He'll find his way back.He always does.He'll turn up. He'll sneak inwith that rattoothed giggle.Aarfy, if anything happens to me,will you take care of my girl? Listen to him, his girl! Don't worry.Nothing's gonna happen to youthat won't happen to the rest of us. I'll be through in a minute. No, you won't. You always say that,then I watch you fit some tiny thinginto that masterpiece of junk. Then I guess you haven't seen it. You guess I haven't seen what?A little square gasket,about this big. Have you seen it? I'll have to start all over again. Please don't do that. Why? It gives me a terrible pain. Why? Why what?Why won't you fly with me?What's that got to do with the painthat you and your bolts give me?It's got everything to do with it.Are you trying to tell me something?Just that if you were smart,you'd fly with me. You've cracked up three planes. Four. I'm a good pilot. I don't want to end up in the sea. You'd thank me. For drowning me? For finishing this stove.Winter's coming.You'll have heat, hot water...You'll be able to boil eggsand everything. Me? Where are you gonna be? I dunno. Here and there.No one wants to fly with you.You're a oneman disaster area. They're crazy. I agree with them.You're crazy. Orr? He's dead. Who's ""he""? He's just a kid from my home town.He just died. They camefrom the States to see him. Get in the bed, will you? What?His mother, father and brother flewout here. They know he's dying. What do you want me to do? Be him.Just for a few minutes,then they'll go.They came , milesto see you before you die. I'm not dying! Of course you are. We all are.They'll know.They came to see their son.They'll take what they can get.One dying boyis as good as another. Or as bad! It won't work. These people have come a long way.I don't want to disappoint them.I'm sentimental about old people. What if they start crying? They probably will start crying.I'll wait outside and if it getssticky I'll come in and break it up.It's not gonna work.Do this for meand I'll do something for you. Will you ground me? I can't.You can fill out a slip saying I'mon the verge of a nervous collapse.Sure I can.But there's a catch. Catch. Group won't approve my action.They'll put you back on combat statusand send me to rot in the Pacific. My God, here they are. Start dying.Do this for me and I'll send youto Rome on a fiveday R and R.He looks terrible. He's sick, Pa. Harvey. My name is Yossarian. His name is Yossarian, Ma.Yossarian, don't you recognise me?I'm your brother John.Don't you know who I am? Sure I do. You're my brother John. Pa, he knows me.Yossarian, look, here's Papa.Say hello to Papa. Hello, Papa. Hello, Harvey. His name is Yossarian, Pa. He looks so bad.He's very sick.The doctor says he's gonna die.Ma, his name is Yossarian.She doesn't remember things too good.It's OK. She can call me Harveyif she wants to.Don't worry.Everything's gonna be all right.I know.We came from New York. We wereafraid we wouldn't get here in time. In time for what? To see you before you died.What difference would it make?We didn't want you to dieby yourself.What difference would it make?He's getting delirious.He keeps repeating the same thing.It's not Harvey, it's Yossarian.What difference does it make?He's dying.Listen, kid, it's not bad.I'm gonna put a tourniquet on it.There. It's good.It's a good bandage.Cold.Cold. God.It's gonna be OK, kid.We'll be home soon.Does the leg still hurt?You in there? Is that Orr, you son of a bitch? It's me, Nately.Nately. What's happening?Jesus, it's : in the morning.It's Dobbs, we've got to stop him.He's gonna kill the Colonel.Cathcart?Dobbs is gonna kill Colonel Cathcart?What's the matter with you?Nothing. It's the first sane thingI've ever done. They'll get you for murder! Old Cathcart's the murderer! Come on, gimme the gun! Take it easy. You just got a few more missions. You're crazy!He'll raise the number againand you know it!He'll keep us flying missionstill we're all dead.What do you care?You don't wanna go home,you're in love with that whore.You're talking about my fiancée.The fiancée any guywith ten bucks in his pocket,who's happy to risk a dose of diseasefor  minutes of phoney moanson a dirty mattress!I think I hurt him.He'll be all right.Here he comes! Gimme the gun! No, listen!If he raises the number again,I swear I'll help you kill him! Really? I swear it.That's very reasonable of you. Something's going on. What do you mean?Milo and the Colonelare up to something.They've been planning somethingup there. What's he doing? Something.

Who?Nately's whore.Aren't you looking for her? Do you know where she is? Of course I do.You're AWOL, Yossarian.I thought you knew better than that. Nately wouldn't be that dumb. He's dead. It's too bad. He was nice. Your boys made a direct hit on him.But he died a rich man. He hadover  shares in the Syndicate. He's dead. His family will get it. He didn't have one. Then his parents get it. They don't need it, they're rich. Then they'll understand.Ask for number . I didn't know.

Come on, get back! Back up, folks.Aarfy, are you insane?They're gonna throw you in jail.You just killed a girl.She's lying in the street!She has no right to be there,you know. It's after curfew.Don't you realise what you've done?You've murdered a human being!They can hang you!I don't think they'll do that,not to good old Aarfy.They won't care about one girlwhen thousands die every day.They're coming for you.They're coming to arrest you.You can't take the life of anotherhuman being and get away with it!They're coming to get you! You're under arrest. But I didn't...You're AWOL. We're sending you home. What?I said we're sending you home.You have been making things terriblydifficult for Colonel Cathcart.The men are unhappy, morale isdeteriorating. It's all your fault.It's his,for raising the number of missions. It's your fault for not flying. Have you no patriotism?Wouldn't you give your life for yourcountry? For Colonel Korn and me?What have you and Colonel Korngot to do with my country?You're a disgrace to your country!How did you get to be a captain? You promoted me. That has got nothing to do with it!Let me. Let me.Captain, I'd like to appeal toyour better judgment one more time.There's a mission about to start.You can get on that plane,and we'll pretendthat all of this never happened.Won't it make you feel proudto know you served in an outfitthat averaged more combat missionsthan any other?Don't you want more unit citationsand oakleaf clusterson your Air Medal?Don't you want to contribute more tothe record by flying more missions?In that case,we'll just have to send you home.Of course, there's one catch.Yeah? What's that?We will issue orderssending you back to the Statesand there's one thingyou have to do for us in return.What would that be?Like us.Like you?Like us.You'll be surprised how easy it isonce you begin.You see, we're going to put youon Easy Street. Promote you to Major. Give you another medal. Send you home a hero. You'll have parades in your honour.You can make speeches,raise money for war bonds. All you have to do is be our pal. Say nice things about us.Tell the folks at homewhat a good job we're doing.Take our offer.It's either thator a courtmartial for desertion.What about the others?I'd be playing a dirty trick on them.They'll be happier when you're gone.They won't even think about you.They have a war to win.If they don't want to flyany more missions, let them say so. Precisely. Exactly.It's a deal.Help! Help!Help him! What? Help him! Help him! Help who? Help the bombardier! I'm the bombardier, I'm all right. Then help him. Help him!I'm cold.I'm cold. God.It's gonna be OK, kid.We'll be home soon. Does the leg still hurt? No.There, there.There, there.There, there. May we come in? Sure.I see you're all alone.Well, you're going home. I don't know if I am. I've got your orders right here.That parade they're rehearsingis for you. You're a hero.You're gonna get a medal forstopping that Nazi killing Cathcart.That wasn't a Nazi.That was Nately's whore.She tried to kill mebecause I told her about Nately. But the Colonel said that... It's a deal I made with them.They send me home a heroand I say wonderful thingsabout them back in the States.That's a lousy deal, isn't it? Isn't it? Well...Isn't it?I don't know,I'm not here to judge you.What are you here for?I'm not too sure about that either.What would you do if you were me?I don't know. I mean, I'm not you.Imagine that you are me.That's hard. Sometimes I even havetrouble imagining that I'm me,if you know what I mean.I'm gonna call the deal off.Let them send me homecos I've flown over  missions.Then they'd haveto send home every man. That's their problem. It's your problem. They'll courtmartial you. Make the best of a bad situation. No. No what?I've been lying in this bedfor three weeks thinking about itand all I know isI don't want to go to prisonand I can't play Cathcart's game. What else can you do? I can run away.You'll desert? How would youget off the base? That's insane.That's whyit's the only sensible thing to do.They'll call you a coward.It's your country.I've flown  missionsand I've fought for three years,now I'll fight for myself. Suppose everyone felt that way? I'd be a fool to feel different.What would your friends say?I haven't got any.Nately was blown to bits,McWatt killed himself,Hungry Joe was chopped in two,Dobbs disappeared,Aardvark's a murderer,Doc Daneeka's a zombie.They're all gone.The only friend I had was Snowdenand I didn't even know him.What about Orr? Orr's at the bottom of the sea. No, he isn't. Don't you know? Know what? Orr's in Sweden.What?After  weeks at sea, Orr was foundby a trio of Swedish girl scouts. A miracle. He rowed all the way. He rowed? In that tiny little raft.Think of that, all the way to Sweden! He'll sit out the rest of the war. It's a miracle!It's no miracle.He has to have planned it. He went to Sweden deliberately? It's  or  thousand miles away!He always said thatcrashlanding was good practice. Getting shot down in the sea. On every mission that he flew!That is a miracle.Practisinggetting shot down in the sea!He made it?He made it?He made it!That son of a bitch made it! Are you crazy? Is he crazy? If he made it, so can I! We gotta stop him. I can do it, Danby! They'll catch you! I can do it. This is insane! What about your clothes?They won't recognise meout of uniform.You'll be on the run,in constant danger of betrayal!I live that way now. For God's sake, hurry up! So long, Chaplain. How do you feel, Yossarian? Fine, except I'm scared to death. You'll have to keep on your toes. I'll keep on my toes. You'll have to jump. I'll jump.Jump!"
Little Big Man,1970,"I am, beyond a doubt,the last of the oldtimers.My name is Jack Crabb.And I am the sole white survivorof the Battleof Little Big Horn...uh... uh...popularly knownas Custer's Last Stand.Well...Mr. Crabb, I'm more interestedin the primitive lifestyleof the Plains Indianthan I am in the...tall tales about Custer.Tall tales?!Are you calling me a liar? No, no... Huh?No, it's just that...I'm interestedin the way of lifeof the Indian rather than,shall we say, adventure.You think the Battle of LittleBig Horn was... was a......was an adventure?Oh, shit.Little Big Horn was notrepresentative of...encounters between Whitesand Indians, Mr. Crabb.You see the...near genocide of the Indian...The... the... the near what?!Near genocide.It means: ""extermination;the killing offof an entire people.""That's practicallywhat we did to the Indian.But of course, I wouldn't expectan old Indian fighter like youto agree with me.Turn that thing on.I beg your pardon?I said, turn that thing onand shut up.Now you just set there,and you'll learn something.I knowed GeneralGeorge Armstrong Custerfor what he was.And I also knowed the Indians...for what they was. years ago,when I was ten years old,my family...in crossin' the Great Plains...was wiped outby a band of wild Indians.Everybody was killed or drug offby them murderin' varmints,except meand my sister Caroline.Goodbye, Jack.I'll see you in heaven.Goodbye, Caroline.We didn't knowthe difference then,but it was a band of Pawneewhat attacked us before.I ain't had no use for Pawneeever since.But this one wasn't a Pawnee.He was a Cheyenne brave.I later got to know him well.His name wasShadow That Comes In Sight.At first sightof an Indian camp,what you think is, ""I seetheir dump, where's the camp?""He brought us to their chief.His name was Old Lodge Skins,who later become my granddaddy.What do they want, Caroline?It's as plain as daywhat they want, Jack.What?Me.To show good manners,Old Lodge Skins smokedwith our oldest male survivor.They didn't know I was a woman.That explains whythey didn't rape me right off.I don't think they're gonnabother you, Caroline.No such luck, Jack.They'll get me tonight,for sure.Poor Caroline never didhave no luck with men.I reckoned she figuredwe both couldn't get away,and she'd send help backto rescue me.Next morning, I found myselfin that Indian camp all alone.But the Cheyenne, who callthemselves the ""Human Beings,""had no idea to hurt me.I was an honored guest,and they gave me a real treatfor breakfast: Boiled dog.Dog ain't bad, neither.Now dog is greasy, I'll admit,but you'd be surprisedhow downright delicatethe flavor is,especially when you're starving.You see, the Human Beingsadopted me as one of their own.Shadow That Comes In Sighttaught me the bow and arrowand how to stalk game.Burns Red In The Sunshowed me how to protectmy pale skin from sunburn.It's a little known fact thatsome Indians, like Burns Red,will sunburn their own selves.But my real teacherwas my adopted grandpa,Old Lodge Skins.He taught me to read a trail,the Cheyenne language,and lots of other things.For a boy,it was a kind of paradise.I wasn't just playing Indian,I was living Indian.Only one thing bothered me.I was small for my years.In fact, a durn near runt.The Pawnee stoleseven of our ponies.There's gonna be a war party.But you can't go.You're too littleand weak like a girl.Run away now or I'll kick you.The Indians had never heardof fistfightin',and it plum amazed 'em.How did you do that?I'm sorry, Younger Bear.I didn't mean to hurt you.The Indian way...you should never feel sorryabout beating an enemy unlesshaving conquered his body,you want his spirit as well.I had made the firstreal enemy of my life.There once was a Human Being,and he was very small,but he won a name:Little Man.You've heard of him.No, Grandfather.He went on a war partyagainst the Pawnees.But the Pawnees were many.One by one, the HumanBeings were rubbed out.Little Man was very brave.The Pawnees called out to him,""If you will quit fighting,we will let you go.""But Little Man answered,""It's a good day to die.""Finally, they cut off his head.But he kept fightingwithout his head.He rode among the Pawneeslike a whirlwind.And his head...it was stuck on a spear...started to shout the war cry.The Pawnees could take no more,and they ran away.When they looked back,they saw the body of Little Manlie down among his friends.Little Man was small,but his bravery was big.The Human Beings don't requirea boy to be a warriorif he ain't gotthe temperament for it,and Little Horse didn't.If he wanted to stay behindwith the womenthat was all rightwith the Human Beings.We will leave the ponies here.You two will hold them.No! I don't want to stay here.I want to go to the Pawnee camp.You!You aren't even a Human Being!You're white.He didn't believe it himself.Younger Bear was just tryingto hand methe worst possible insult.Little white man.Fool poor Pawnee.Big fooling.You want to eat?Shit, Pawnees was alwayssucking up to whites.Little white man not mad, huh?See? Pawnee friend.See?!Fixes bad Injunfor little white man.I always felt kind of badabout that poor Pawnee.I didn't mean to kill him.I just meant to distract him.I had made a real enemyof Younger Bear.I give you these ponies...but... I owe you a life.Saving his lifewas the final insult.This boy is no longer a boy.He's a brave.He is little in body,but his heart is big.His name shall be""Little Big Man.""I don't understand it,Grandfather.Why would they killwomen and children?Because they are strange.They do not seem to knowwhere the centerof the Earth is.We must havea war on these cowardsand teach them a lesson.This will be the first time,my son,I face the whites as an enemy.I don't knowwhether you rememberbefore you became a Human Being,and as dear a son to me as thoseI made with Buffalo WallowWoman and the others...But I won't speak ofthat unfortunate time.I just want to say,if you believeriding against thesewhite creatures is bad,you can stay out of the fight.No one will think the worse.Grandfather,I think it's a good day to die.My heart soars like a hawk.I'm sorry to saythat Old Lodge Skins' waragainst the whiteswas kind of pitiful.Not that the Human Beingwasn't brave.No warrior everwalked the earthmore brave than a Human Being.Old Lodge Skins' idea of warand the whites' idea of warwere kind of different.Half our partydidn't even use weapons.What they done was ""take coup,""hit the enemywith a little stick.Humiliate them.That was how the Human Beingstaught a coward a lessonand won a war.Shadow!Look at 'em go!We got 'em runnin', boys!Go get that black bastard!Shooting riflesagainst bow and arrow.I never could understandhow the white worldcould be so proud of winningwith them kind of odds.God bless George Washington!Before I knowed it, them wordsjust popped out of my mouth.God bless my mother!You murdering fool!Got to cut your throat to get itthrough your headI'm a white man.White?Sure I'm white.Didn't you hear me say""God bless George Washington""?""God bless my mother""?I mean, now, what kindof Indian would saya fool thing like that?Lend me thatto get off this paint.Yeah.The troopers took meunder their wingand turned me overto the Reverend Silas Pendrakefor moral guidanceand a Christian upbringing.Can you drive a buggy, boy?Oh, yes, sir.I can do it.You're a liar, boy.If you was reared by the Indianshow could you learnto drive a buggy?We shall have to beatthe lying out of you.Oh, dear Jack.Welcome to your new home.Your travail is over,enfolded now as you arein Christian love.Well, boy,are you unable to converse?Huh?No, I'm glad to meetyour daughter, sir.You are addressing my wife, boy.Poor boy.Poor darling.Think of the yearsof suffering,deprivation and hardshipamong those awful savages.The boy's deprivation, my dear,has been more spiritualthan physical.The Indians know nothing of Godand moral right.They eat human flesh,fornicate,adulterize,misogynize andcommune constantlywith minions of the devil.It must be our task,nay, our Christian duty,to beat the misery out...Beat the poor boy?Not while there'sa breath left in my body.I could have kissed her.Well, I didn't meanbeat him literally, my dear.I meant to beat himsymbolically.Poor boy.He hasn't even hada proper bath.His darling neck is so...I detect the odor of food.I shall wash this poor,dirty boy.It's suppertime!Silas,it is my Christian dutyto give this boy an immediatethorough bath.Take off your clothes, dear.Take my clothes off?Yes.All of them?EEvery stitch.But I shall avert my eyesat the necessary moment.Bringing inThe sheavesBringing in the sheavesWe shall come rejoicingBringing in the sheaves.Greatest bathI ever had in my life.Shall we gather at the river,The beautiful,the beautiful river?You do realize,don't you, dear Jack,that the Reverend Pendrakeis not altogether wrong.What?What, ma'am?Well, Jesus is your savior.You do realize that,don't you dear Jack?Oh, Lordy, yes, Mrs. Pendrake.Are you thinking of Jesus, Jack?Yes'm. Yes, ma'am.Yes, ma'am.But you musn't fib to me,you know.Oh, no, I love Jesus and Mosesand all of them...There's quite a difference.Moses was a Hebrew,but Jesus was a gentile,like you and me.Aren't you donewashing that boy yet?I'm giving the child importantreligious instruction, Silas.I want to eat!Looks like a pretty wellgrowedchild, if you ask me.All right now, dear,please stand upand let me dry you off.I shall avert my eyes,of course.Fine... now stepout of the tub...and...Actually, you arerather well grown, Jack.You're small but...niceIooking.Did you know that?No, ma'am.Well, you are.All the more reasonfor you to receivecomplete religiousinstruction.The girls, I'm sure,will all be after you.And Jack...Ma'am?That way lies madness.What way, ma'am?You, you'll understand thesethings better when you're older.The point is, my dear boythat we allmust resist temptation.Purity is its own reward.Dear Jack.Welcome to your new home.Now dress...and come in to supper.I went to schooland learned all overhow to read and writeand cipher.It was strange at first,but Mrs. Pendrake tutored me,and I learned fast.But there was one thing I didn'tknow nothing about,and that was a thing called sin.Aha! I caught youat the gates of hell!Boy!The hand of Godmust smite the carcass of man!It's worth it, dear, Jack.It's worth it a million timesover to be pure and good.To walk in the pathsof righteousness.There's no happiness like it.Do you believe me, Jack?Do you believe me?Yes, ma'am.I sure do.Amazing grace, how sweet...So it was I enteredmy religion period.I was a greatlittle hymn singer.And I wasn't fooling, neither.I'd been saved!I baptize you in the nameof the Father and the Sonand the Holy Spirit!Oh, Lord, look down uponthis poor boy who livedamong the heathen,and cleanse himof the corruptionof their foul and pagan ways.And make him whiteagain as the snow.Let him be rebornand repurifiedin Thy name.I baptize youin the name of the Fatherand the Sonand the Holy Spirit!Amen.Mrs. Pendrake was rightabout temptation.Jack...I wasn't having nothingto do with them Jezebels.I told her all about my triumphover temptation,and we read the Biblefor about an hour, to celebrate.As the weeks went by,I fell more and morein love with Mrs. Pendrake.Spiritually, of course.Well...I shall be off onmy Wednesday shopping.The boy's doing so poorthese days,why don't youtake him along and air him?He'd be bored with shopping.No, I wouldn't, ma'am.All right, then,you come with me, Jack.Good morning, Mr. Kane.Ma'am.This is Jack,my adopted son.What's your pleasure, ma'am?Well, let's see...I think I shall havea sassafras flip.How about you, buster?Huh?Oh, yeah, I'll have the same.Never mind for me, Mr. Kane.I must be offwith my shopping.It would bore you terribly,Jack, dear.You stay hereand have some cake.I'll take care of him,Mrs. Pendrake.Thank you very much,I'm sure, Mr. Kane.That soda shop was something.Especially thatelephanthead spigot.I was playing with it,and enjoying myself,then, all of a sudden,an awful feelingrun through me.Where had that fellow gone to?Don't...Don't...No, don't...Oh, yeah...No, don't!You beast...DoDon't...Pagan beast! Oh!Help!Oh, oh, you devil!You filthy, dirty devil!Heathen!Yes! No!Ye... Ye... Ye...Oh! Yeah, yeah...Yeah, yeah...No... Help!Help! Help! I'm dying...She was calling him a deviland moaning for help,but I didn't get no ideashe wanted to be rescued.That was the endof my religion period.I ain't sung a hymnin  years.After starving awhile,I took up with a swindler.Name ofAllardyce T. Meriweather.After Mrs. Pendrake,his honesty wasdownright refreshing.At no cost to you,it is my missionto pass on to youDead Man's Potion...Meriweather was one of thesmartest men I ever knowed.But he tendedto lose parts of himself.When I joined him,his left hand and his left earwere already gone....might be ableto see a miracle,one I have witnessedmany times before.The power of thiselixir has been provento reverse men's ills...It'll cure your sores and...During my years withMeriweather,he lost an eye as a resultof a fifth acedropping out of his sleevein a poker game.It didn't faze him, though.Deception was his life's blood,even if it caused himto get whittled downkind of graduallike.Thank you.You're improving, Jack.You just can't seem to get ridof that streak of honestyin you.The one that ruined you wasthat damned Indian, old Tepee.You mean Old Lodge Skins.He gave you a visionof moral order in the universe,and there isn't any.Those stars twinklein a void, there, boy,and the twolegged creatureschemes and dreams beneath them,all in vain.All in vain, Jack.You hear anything?Listen to me!Twolegged creaturewill believe anything,and the more preposterous,the better.Whales speak Frenchat the bottom of the sea.The horses of Arabiahave silver wings.Pygmies mate with elephantsin darkest Africa.I have soldall those propositions.Or maybe we're all fools,and none of it matters.Ah.You staywith Allardyce Meriweather,and you'll wear silk.But I don't know asI want to wear silk.My dear boy, what elsecan a man of parts wearthan silk?Tar and feathers,I reckon!All right.Sit right there.Don't make no movesunless you want a littledaylight in your liver.What, may I ask, brings you outinto the wildsat this hour, sir?

That what we is, Jack!Ruined!Do you have another trade,my good man?Well, General, I...not exactly.Then take my advice: Go west.West! Oh! Oh!My wife, she... she'sawful scared of Indians.My dear woman,you have nothing to fearfrom the Indians;I give youmy personal guarantee.Olga! Olga!Hit him! Hit him!Sorry, brother.I think we're going to get away!Let me at the savages!I got a gun!Let me at 'em!Let me at 'em!Let me at 'em!I got a gun here!We must be civilized!Hey! Hey!""And it came to pass,after the plague,""that the Lord stayed,and then He said...""Grab the reins!Grab the reins!Shoot him!Give me... give methat shotgun!No, it's mine!Get back in! Get back!I'll protect you!Olga!Olga!Ow!Olga...I covered most of three statesand hundreds of square mileslooking for Olga,with no luck at all.Hey, Crabb!Whiskey...Crabb!Whiskey...Whiskey...For a drink of whiskey,they'll give youone of their squaws.Whiskey...Sure save youa lot of looking.Whiskey...I looked everywhere for my wifebut couldn't find her.Finally, I had to godeeper into Cheyenne country.I didn't figurefor me it was dangerous...speaking Cheyenne and havingonce been a Human Being myself.Let's kill him.I didn't stealyour father's ponies, brother.Why do you keep calling mebrother?I want you to stop doing that.I am not your brother.I am a Human Being.I suppose you will sayyou have never heardof Little Big Man.Little Big Man was my brother,but you're not him.He fought beside mein battle and was killedafter rubbing outmany bluecoats.Did you see the body?No, he turned into a swallowand flew away.Let's kill him and go home.Shadow!You were shot there.I picked you upand put you on a pony.I saved you.Dirt on the Nose.Do you still have the black ponyI gave youup at the Powder River?No, the Pawnee stole him,when we camp at the OldWomen Butte, five snows ago.It is true there is a thing hereI do not understand.There is a pain between my ears.My son.To see you again causes my heartto soar like a hawk.Sit herebeside me.Grandfather, I brought youthis present.Is this the hat I used to own,except grown softer of skinand fatter?No, Grandfather, it's another.We must smoke to your return.I saw you in a dream.You were drinking from a springthat came from the long noseof an animal.I did not recognize the animal.Alongside his nose,he grew two horns,and the water that gushedfrom his nose was full of air.I can't explain it,but he was talking aboutthat elephanthead spigotin the soda shop.And this wasn't the only timeOld Lodge Skins had dreamsthat turned out true.Don't be angry,my son,with Burns Red, Shadow,and the others.They had many a bad experiencewith the white man last year.I have thought and talkedand smoked on this matterand my decision is...Little Big Man has returned.It was quite a homecoming.Little Big Man.It was Little Horse,the boy who didn't wantto fight the Pawnee.Don't you remember me?This hurts me in my heart.I think I'll cry.He'd become a Heemanah,for which there ain'tno English word.And he was a good one, too.The Human Beingsthought a lot of him.Hello, Younger Bear.Goodbye.It was the boywhose life I had saved,to his mortal embarrassment.Did you catch rabbitson your hunting trip?No.Then don't give the rabbitsyou didn't catchto Buffalo Wallow Woman.You see,Younger Bear had becomea Contrary, the most dangerousof all Cheyenne warriorsbecause the way they livedrives them half crazy.Except for battle,a Contrarydoes everything backwards.He says goodbyewhen he means hello,yes when he means no,walks through bushesinstead of on trails,and washes with dirt,and dries with waterand so forth.I thought you were dead.Why have you come backwhen nobodywants to see you?You mustn't speakto Little Big Man like that.You owe him a life.I'm glad I said it. Hello.That was supposed to meanhe was sorry he said it,goodbye.But that warrior wasn't sorry.He hated me still.Grandfather,I have a white wife.You do?That's interesting.Does she cookand does she work hard?Oh, yes, Grandfather.That surprises me.Does she show pleasantenthusiasm when you mount her?Well, sure, Grandfather.That surprises me even more.I tried one of them oncebut she didn't showany enthusiasm at all.Well, Grandfather,all the whites aren't crazy.I'm glad to hear that, my son.I thought they were.Oh, no.I know of one who isas brave as any Human Being.I'd like to meet this manand smoke with him.What is he called?He's called General Custer.General Custer.What does the name mean, my son?Well, it, it means...long hair.Good name.How did he win it?He won it in the warof the whitesto free the black men.Oh, yes.The black white man.I know of them.It is said a black white manonce became a Human Being.But mostly they arestrange creatures.Not as ugly as the white, true,but they're just as crazy.Don't worry, my son.You'll returnto the Human Beings.I dreamed it last night.I saw you and your wivesas you crawledfrom one to the otherin your tepee.Wives, Grandfather?Oh, yes.Three or four.It was darkand they were hiddenunder buffalo robes.But it wasa great copulation, my son.Grandfather,the Human Beingsonly take one wife.How could I have three or four?I don't know.It worries me.I was sureI'd never see him again.Sir, I expect being a scoutis the best way for meto find my wife, General.She was captured by the Cheyennedue to our going west,just like you advised.I advised? That's impossible.I've never set eyeson you before.Oh, I wouldn't figureyou'd remember me, sir.Furthermore, you don'tlook like a scout to me.Not a bit.A scout hasa certain appearance.Kit Carson, for example.But you don't have it.You look like...a mule skinner.Well, I don't knowanything aboutmules, sir.It's a remarkable thing,but I can tellthe occupation of a manmerely by looking at him.Notice the bandy legs.Hmm?Strong arms.This man has spent yearswith mules.Isn't that correct?Well, I...Yes, sir.Hire the mule skinner!Yes, sir.Over here.Come on.Did you just hear what he said?Supposed to hire you.I wouldn't wantno wife of mine backafter she'd beenwith the Injuns.Kindest thing,a bullet in the brain.Well, I don't agree.And I want my wife back.Well...one of the Pawnee locateda band of the vermincamped down the river.We ride in the morning!IsIs there, is thereany white women with them?Now my advice to youis to get yourselfa little revengeon them bucks.All right.Spare the females and children,if possible.Let's go.No!Hey!No!Hey!He said spare the womenand children!Give me that!Let go of my rifle!The hell I will.You've killedthe women and babies!You bastard!You son of a bitch!Let go of my horse!Call 'em back, sir!You'll hang for this!It was downright discouraging.If it wasn't the Indianstrying to kill me for a white,it was the whites tryingto kill me for an Indian.It made me sick.The Pawnee scoutsand soldiers bothwas killingeverything in sight.Shadow!Brother, let's talk.You'll be took care of later.I'm saving you for the hanging.There's no describinghow I felt.An enemy had saved my lifeby the violent murderof one of my best friends.The world was too ridiculouseven to bother to live in.That was why Shadow was there,and that was whyhe'd fought so hard.I sat thereand watched that babycome into this world.Except for her breathing,that woman never made a sound.If woman she was.She didn't lookmore than a girl.I couldn't take my eyesoff of that girl and her baby.All right,let's get the hell out.Let the Pawnee clean up.Bugler, assemble our troop!Listen to me.If you are kin to Shadow...then you know of Little Big Man.I was a friendof the Human Beingsuntil they stole my wife.Are you Shadow's wife?His daughter?Where is your husband?Killed.What's your name?Sunshine.I'm going totake you with me...and trade youfor my wife.Clear them bushes, Younger.Move on. Nobody here.Let's get the hell out.Wait here, woman.Hello, Grandfather.Greetings, my son.Do you want to eat?Grandfather?What happened to your neck,Grandfather?It's a wound.It cut the tunnelthrough which light travelsto the heart.You... you mean you're blind?Oh, no.My eyes still see.But my heart no longerreceives it.How did it happen?White man.Where's Buffalo Wallow Woman?Rubbed out.And White Elk Woman, too.And Dirt on the Nose.And High Wolf.And many others.And Burns Red?Yes.Burns Red in the Sun?Rubbed out.His wife... his children...and many more.Do you hate them?Do you hatethe white man now?Do you see this fine thing?Do you admirethe humanity of it?Because the Human Beings,my son,they believeeverything is alive.Not only man and animals,but also water, earth, stone,and also the things from them,like that hair.The manfrom whom this hair came,he's bald on the other sidebecause I now own his scalp.That is the way things are.But the white men,they believeeverything is dead:Stone, earth, animals,and people.Even their own people.If things keep trying to live,white man will rub them out.That is the difference.You will stay with us...my son.A year later,I was still with 'em.After wandering all over,in constant dangerof being killed by whitesettlers or white soldiers,we come to a placeknowed as the Indian Nations.It was a tract of landby the Washita Riverthat had been gived foreverto the Indians by the Congressand the Presidentof the United States.We was safe there.This was Indian land.As long as grass growedand wind blowand the sky is blue.Your new son'skicking a lot today.I think he wants to come outand see his father.Tell him to waituntil I finish my dinner.I'll tell him, but I don't thinkhe's going to wait much longer.It's a good thingI have a strong, brave husbandwho brings in so muchgame and food.Mmhmm.My strong husbandbrings in much morethan we need.There are manyHuman Beings here.Many bandsfrom many places.But it's sad.Many husbandshave been rubbed outby the white man.It is sad because womensleep alone and cry.Be quiet now.I'm digesting.Yes, but I thinkmy sisters are here.Your what?!My sisters.Digging Bear, Little Elkand Corn Woman.I think they're here.What do you mean,you think they're here?I believe they are.You bring inmuch more food than we need.It is very sad.They have no husbandsand they cry.Well, that's too bad;I'm sorry.Digging Bear had a babyand lost it.And so did Corn Woman.But Little Elkhad no baby at all.All right, what do you want meto do about it?I knew you'd understand.It was Old Lodge Skins' dreamtrying to come true.I was determined to stay outof them buffalo robes.Three young and healthy womenwith no manfor who knows how long. Mmm.The very idea kind of shrunk melike a spider on a hot stove.Why, it's Little Big Man!Oh, Little Big Man!Younger Bear,it's Little Big Man!He's not a Contrary anymore.He has a wife.She's plump, she works hard,but she henpecks him.Just when I think you are dead,and the buzzards have eaten you,you always come back.Yes, and I always willtill you pay methe life you owe me.I've heard you.Now, come to my tepeeand eat.We was caughtin Cheyenne hospitality.I'm a very important man.More important than you.I have a wifeand four horses.I have a horseand... four wives.Well, that may be.But... my wife,she's a very good one.See?Oh, sothere you are,you crawling coyote.What are we going to eat, huh?This starved duck?Oh...Oh, who's the foolish beggaryou brought to stealwhat little food we have?Clean it, clean it!Ooh!It was Olga.I had found her at last.One duck.Olga never did learnmuch Englishbut she sure in hellhad learned Cheyenne.I, I, I justdon't understand it.Usually, this woman is...gentle as a dove.My words were not the wordsto speak to a stranger.You stay and eat.You see what a good wife she is?It's becauseI'm a wonderful lover.Go in my tepee.She will cook this duck for you.That's all right;I'm not hungry.You've humiliated him again.Goodbye, Younger Bear.You look tired, Little Big Man.Do you wantto come into my tepeeand rest on soft furs?Why don't you live with me,and I'll be your wife?Thank you for inviting me.Well, I've got to fix my hairto sing tonight.Goodbye, Little Big Man.Goodbye, Little Horse.And so I finally found Olga.I'd lost her long agoto the Human Beings,and I saw no good reasonto reveal myself to her now.Grandfather!Why have you moved your tepeeso far from our band?The ponies are tryingto tell me something.Last night I had a dream.The ponies were dying.I heard them scream.I'd learned to respectOld Lodge Skins' dreams,but for once,we were in a safe place,give to us by a treaty.Why do you hate my sisters?I don't hate your sisters, I...It... it's just that...the Great Spirit...tells me...Where are you going?Your son won't wait any longer.He wants to come outand see his father.Sunshine, Indian style,was going off to have her baby.As I watched her walk away,it come over methat the Great Spirit wanted meto go in that tepee.Who wants to be first?Who's this here?It's me.Well, I...guess you'll do as well as any.I figuredshe was the littlest one,and it would be easy.But Lord help us,them young girls is deadly.However, the Great Spiritwas with me...and I survived.Only thing was,just as I was aboutto drift off real peaceful...No, you stay.Not yet.Maybe I can get back later.Idle boasting, I assure you.Who's this here?It's me, Digging Bear.Well, she wasn't calledDigging Bear for nothing,I can tell you that.Stay here.Corn Woman's too tired.Oh.She don't sound tired to me.That's not her.That's Little Elk.That's both of them.Little Elk, you go on to sleep.You, too.Digging Bear!Corn Woman, where are you?I was luckyI come across her last.The others, too?Yes.I knew you were a good man.Here's your new son.I reckon right thenI come pretty closeto turning pure Indian,and I probably would have spentthe rest of my dayswith Sunshine and her sisters.But sometimes grass don't grow,wind don't blow......and the sky ain't blue.Something's wrongwith the ponies.Wolves.Grandfather's d... Here!Go inside.Don't leave the tepee.Grandfather,what's wrong with the ponies?Don't you hear that, my son?I wonder why I didn't see themin my dream.Sunshine!Sunshine!Grandfather,you've got to get inside.Why bother, son?It's a good day to die.We've got to getto the riverbank!I am blind.I cannot fight.But I won't run.If it'smy day to die,I want to do it herewithin a circle.Grandfather...the river is partof the great circleof the waters of the Earth.That's true,but the soldiers would kill usbefore we could getto the river.The sol...? Grandfather,you didn't see any soldiersin your dream,andand that means that...that they can't see you now.You think so?Yes, yes.What else did your dream mean?I think you're right.Then let's go to the greatcircle of the river!Invisible.I never been invisible before.It's too late.We're cut off.It doesn't matter.We're invisible.Grandfather, wait!Grandfather!I know it sounds ridiculousbut them soldiers neverlifted a hand to stop us.I reckon it was so crazy,they couldn't figure it out.Or maybe they thoughtwe was prisonersor even friendliessince Old Lodge Skinswas grinning at themlike a raccoon.Or maybewe really was invisible.All I knowed is we walkedright through 'em to the river.Circle the camp!Circle the camp, boys!That was extremely enjoyable.Glad you liked itGrandfather.Captain!Captain......shoot the Indian ponies.I beg your pardon, sir?That is my decision. I shall shoot the ponies. But, sir! Sunshine... Go and do it!Yes, sir.Young man,your selfrighteous pietyis commencing to annoy me.But lI didn'tsay anything, sir.You think it's shockingto shoot a few ponies?Well, let me tell you,the women are far more importantthan the ponies.The point is,they breed like rats,however, Lieutenant,this is a legal action.And the men are under strictorders not to shoot the women.Unless, of course,they refuse to surrender.Isn't that correct?!Yes, sir, yes, sir.Sunshine!Run! Run!Run!No!No!Where you going, soldier?Message for the General.Wait a minute.What's that on your face?Oh, mud, sir.That's not mud,that's Indian paint.And that's an Indian knife.What's your company?My company, sir?Yes, and the name ofyour commanding officer.What's the trouble, Captain?I think we've gota renegade, General.He's wearing Indian paintand he doesn't knowhis commanding officeror his company.Take him away and hang him.General!General, don't you remember me?I'm Jack Crabb,the mule skinner!Mule skinner?Yes, sir!I applied for a job as scout,but you could tellmy true occupationjust by looking at me.Yes, yes, I believeI do remember that.How did you become a renegade?General...I ain't no renegade!I was captured by the Cheyenneand held prisoner!Why, they...they took cactus thornsand stuck them in me!But I just laughedand begged themto keep on doing it!You... laughed?I laughed my head off!Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.Gentlemen, it is difficultto admit to an error.Captain?Captain, your summary judgmentwas wholly mistaken!Now aren't you glad I saw fitto question thisman more closely?Yes, sir.Please be more carefulin the future, Captain.I'll drink the tea now,Corporal.Yes, sir.What are you doingup here, mule skinner?Nothing, I...just brought you tea, General.And I wanted to...thank you againfor sparing my life.Why are you standingto the side?Turn this way.You came up hereto kill me, didn't you?And you lost your nerve.Well, I was correct, in a sense.You are a renegade,but you are no Cheyenne brave.Custer was right.I was a total failureas an Indian.Do I hang you?I think not.Get out of here.You're not going to hang me?Your miserable lifeis not worththe reversalof a Custer decision.That was the worst thinghe could have done to me.There was nothing leftof my selfrespect at all.I couldn't go backto the Indiansso I went back amongthe whites and become a drunk.Boy, you're a sad sight, Hoss.You should have stuckto sodypop.How are things with you, Bill?Fine.I've changed my ways, Hoss.That's good.Say, Bill,I need a drink worse thana breath of life itself. Here's $. Oh!Get gloriously drunk.But first, go acrossthe street to the barber,and have yourself a bath,and buy some clothes.Then come see me in the saloon.One thing I do know, Hoss,any damn foolcan drink himself to death.Come on. Come on!Bill, I want to...Hoss, I'd like to ask youa confidential favor.It's a delicate matterinvolving aa widow.She needs a train ticketout of town.You give her this.Sure, Bill.See, my new, beautiful wifeis violently jealous,and... and this widow,oh, she's quite a widow.I think I knowwhat you mean, Bill.Her name was Lulu Kane.Right now, Bill.Good.Get out of the way!Get out of the way!Get out of the way!Bill! Bill...He killed my daddy!He killed my daddy!He killed my daddy!He's never gonna shootnobody again!Took me seven yearsto get him, but I got him!Who was he anyhow?Some boy.Hoss......you know that matterwe discussed?The widow?Yes, Bill.Don't tell my wife.That'd really get me in trouble.You've got me downin this goldang water!Come in, stranger.Whatever it is you want,we've got it.Miss Pendrake?You've mistaken mefor someone else, stranger.My name is Lulu.Your name ain't Lulu.You're Louise Pendrake.Whowho are you?Well, I am Jack Crabb.Miss Pendrake,don't you remember me?Jack Crabb?My God.Jack.Well, this is quitea pleasant surprise.Ththis roomis more commodious.And now, whwhat have youbeen doing with yourself?Lulu! What the hellare you doing in heresitting on your ass?There's agentleman waiting.I have a gentlemanin here, too.Oh, I didn't see you, stranger.Is everythingall right? Oh, everything's fine. Need anything?If you do, just ring the bell.Our motto here is""Whatever you want,we've got it.""Well, Jack.Now you know.This is a house of ill fame,and I'm a fallen flower.That widow hadn't losther style one bit.""A fallen flower.""Chokes me up to think about it.This life is not only wickedand sinful,it isn't even any fun.No, I reckon, I reckon not,Miss Pendrake.If I was marriedand could come hereonce or twice a week,well, it might be fun.But every night?It's just boring.Oh, I can understand that.I can't seem to save any money.Well, if I could justsave a few dollarsI could go to visitmymy maiden aunt in Washington.New clothes, a carriage.And who knows,I might even marry a senator.Oh! You'd make a good wifefor a senatorMiss Pendrake.You always were a sweet boy.Do you know,I often had wicked thoughtsabout you?Huh?Oh, yes.Several times.I almost gave in to temptation.And now... here we are.Miss Pendrake,what are you doing?Do you know that onceI tiptoed into your room,and stood over youfor the longest time?It was the most awfultemptation to wake you up.I wish that I had.It would have beendeliciously wicked.Is anythingthe matter, Jack?No.Then I'll wait for you in the...place of retirement.You should havewoke me up that nightyears ago, Miss Pendrake.This is from Wild Bill.It was his last wishthat you go to Washingtonand live with your maiden aunt.His last wishwas to save me?Oh, Jack.I must honor that wish.You can do it, Miss Pendrake.Yes, I can...and I will.I got to go now.Goodbye, Miss Pendrake.Oh, goodbye, Jack.And thank you ever so much.Oh, and Jack......if you're everin Washington, do look me up.How are things with you,Mr. Meriweather?Splendid.Well, now, look at that.Buffalo hides.There's a world of moneychewing grasson those plains, Jack.There goesBuffalo Bill himself.Oh...Yes, sir.Multiply that by thousands.Little Jack, the buffalois getting scarce.You were raised by Indians.You shouldknow how to track them.Yeah, but...We could make a killing, Jack.Haven't changed a bit, Jack.Neither have you.You'd better watch out,Mr. Meriweather.They're whittlin' you downpretty serious.You can't afford to loseany more of your parts.Every businesshas a particle of risk.Bye, dear boy.That was my low.I had reached the bottom.I'd become a hermit.I went deep in the wilderness,as far away as I could get.Then one day,I found somethingtrappers see fairly regular.An animal had gnawed offits own footto escape from the trap.Something snapped in my head.I decidedlife wasn't fit to liveand the only thing to dowas to minglewith the twinkling stars.Goodbye, Jack.Goodbye, Little Big Man.At that moment,I really was crazyand I was darn nearoff that cliff when...The time had cometo look the devil in the eyeand send him to hellwhere he belonged.The only question was,how to get him there?Sergeant, take this man......and give him some clothes.This man will be invaluableto me, Major.Invaluable, sir?I almost hanged that manas a renegade.Now, he asks me for a jobas a scout.Oh, his gameis very obvious... to lead meaway from his Indian friends.I still don't quitefollow you, General.Anything that man tells mewill be a lie.Therefore, he will bea perfect reverse barometer.Isn't that correct?Of course, General.Move them out, men. Ho!In my belief,Custer's hate for the Indiansand his ambitionhad combined on him.He figured he needed one moredramatic victoryover the Indiansto be nominated forPresident of the United States.That is a true historical fact.Men, hold!We will take brief refreshment.Water only!Dismount!Water break!Oh, excuse me, Lieutenant.It's the celibacy of the saddle.I had muscle spasms all night.The poison from the goonads.Poison from the what, sir?Goonads.That's medical terminology.General, it's my duty as your...The poison risesfrom the goonadsto the throat and then seepsdown to various muscles.General...the Crows want to knowif you're going downin the Medicine Tail Coulee.Oh, they do, do they?Yes, sir, they do.They claim they want timeto sing their death song.Tell the Crows they're women!But, sir...if the hostilescome in behind us,and if they'rewaiting for us down below,we'll never get out of there.Hostiles behind us?I see no hostiles behind us.Do you see any hostilesbehind us, Major?No, sir, not at the moment...Then, then, then......stop trying to causea reversalof a Custer decision.But, sir, wouldn't it...wouldn't it be bestto send a squad downMedicine Tail Coulee?No, it wouldn't.But, sir...may I ask, sir, why it wouldn't?Because Major, it would cost usthe vital element of surprise.Surprise? General,they know we're here.Yes, but they don't knowthat I intend to attack themwithout mercy.But, General,that's no surprise.Of course it is.Nothing is this worldis more surprisingthan the attack without mercy.General...General, I must protestthis impetuous decision.A Custer decision, impetuous?Grant called me impetuous, too!The drunkard.Sitting therein the White House,calling me impetuous!General, General,I implore you to reconsider.Think of the menwhose lives depend upon you.What do you thinkI should do, mule skinner?Sir, that mandoesn't know anything.What do you say, mule skinner?Should I go down thereor withdraw?I had him.But this timewhat I held in my handwasn't a knifebut the truth.Well?What's your answer,mule skinner?General...you go down there.You're advising meto go into the Coulee?Yes, sir.There are no Indians there,I suppose?I didn't say that.There are thousandsof Indians down there.And when they get done with you,there won't be nothing leftbut a greasy spot.This ain't the WashitaRiver, General.And them ain't helpless womenand children waiting for you.They're Cheyenne braveand Sioux.You go down thereif you got the nerve.Still trying to outsmart me,aren't you, mule skinner?You want me to think that youdon't want me to go down there,but the subtle truth is,you really don't want meto go down there.Well, are youreassured now, Major?Men of the seventh!The hour of victoryis at hand!Onward to Little Big Hornand glory!We've caught them napping!Sound the charge!We have them on the run, men!Take no prisoners!Now we've got them, men!Men, Custer's with you!Custer's honor!Stay with me!What are they doing?Why aren't they charging?There's nowhere to charge to!Fight! Stand up and fight!Fools! They're shootingtheir own horses.Arrest them! Arrest them!Bugler!

Thank you. Ted! What are you doing here? I've got to talk to you.You shouldn't have come.I don't have time now. Stewardess? Excuse me.But...No wonder you're upset. She's lovely.And a darling figure.Supple, pouting breasts, firm thighs.It's a shame you twodon't get along.Yes, I know.Things used to be different.I remember when we first met.It was during the war.I was in the air force,stationed in Drambuie,off the Barbary Coast.I used to hang outat the Magumba Bar.It was a rough place.The seediest dive on the wharf,populated with every reject andcutthroat from Bombay to Calcutta.It was worse than Detroit.The mood in the place was ugly.You wouldn't be there unlessyou knew how to use your fists.A fight broke out almost every night.I didn't go there that nightto fall in love.I just wanted a couple of drinks.And suddenly, there she was.I was captivated, entranced.It hit me like a thunderbolt.I had to asked this guy to pinch meto make sure I wasn't dreaming.I was afraid to approach her,but that night, fate was on my side.We laughed, we talked, we danced.I never wanted it to end.I guess I still don't.Enough about me. I hopethis hasn't been boring for you.Whenever I talk about Elaine,I get carried away.I lose all track of time.Would you like to order dinner?Joey will have steak.We'll have fish.When can I see the cockpit?The pilots are probably too busyflying the plane for that.Aw, gee whizz!I'll talk to the captainand see what I can arrange.Gee, that'd be swell!Would you care to order your dinners?I would like the steak, please.I'll have the fish.Excuse me, I happened to be passing.I thought you might like some coffee.That's very nice of you. Thank you. Won't you sit down? Thank you. Cream? No, I take it black.Like my men.Ted, I never knewI could be so happy.These past few monthshave been wonderful.Tomorrow, why don't we driveto that little seafood place and... What's the matter? My orders came through.My squadron ships out tomorrow.We're bombing the storage depotsat Daiquiri at  hours.We're coming infrom the north, below their radar.When will you be back?I can't tell you that.It's classified.Oh, Ted, please be careful.I worry about you so much.I love you, Elaine.I love you.Flight er,this is Denver flight control.You're approaching rough weather.Please climb to , feet. Roger, Denver. We have a visitor.Hello.Captain Oveur, Mr Murdock,and Mr Basta, this is Joey Hammen. Hi, Joey. Come up here.This is for special visitors.Would you like to have it? Thank you. Thanks a lot. Sure. Ever been in a cockpit?No, I've never been upin a plane before.Have you ever seen a grown man naked? Shall I check the weather? No, why don't you take care of it?Joey, do you ever hang arounda gymnasium? We'd better get back. No, Joey can stay for a while. Could I? OK, if you don't get in the way.Flight er to Denver,climbing to cruise at ,.Will report again over Lincoln.Over and out.Wait a minute, I know you.You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar.You play basketballfor the Los Angeles Lakers.Sorry, you have me confusedwith someone else.My name's Roger Murdock.I'm the copilot.You are Kareem! I've seen you play.My dad's got season tickets.You should go back to your seat now.Right, Clarence?No, he's not bothering anyone.Let him stay here.All right, but just remembermy name is Roger Murdock.I'm an airline pilot.I think you're the greatest,but my dad says you don't work hardenough on defence.And he says lots of timesyou don't even run downcourt.And you don't try,except during playoffs.The hell I don't!Listen, kid, I've been hearingthat crap ever since I was at UCLA.I'm out there busting my bunsevery night.Tell your old manto drag Walton and Lanierup and down the court for  minutes.Joey...Do you like movies about gladiators?Elaine, just hear me out.Things haven't been rightfor a long time,but it'll be different,like in the beginning, remember?I remember everything.All I have is memories.Mostly, I remember the nightswe were together.I remember how you used to hold me,and how I used to sit on your faceand wriggle, and...afterwards, how we'd watchtill the sun came up.When it did, it was almost like...like each new day wascreated only for us.That's the wayI've always wanted it to be.But it won't be.Not as long as you insiston living in the past!You're too low, Ted! You're too low!The mind plays tricks on you.He looks so happy today, doesn't he?You look so happy today.OK, Robert, slip them down.This won't hurt much.You got a telegramfrom headquarters today.Headquarters? What is it?A big building where generals meet,but that's not important.They've cleared you of any blamefor what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news? Is it?Because of my mistake,six men didn't return from that raid.Seven.Lieutenant Zip died this morning.But Dr Sandler says you'll be outin a week. Isn't that wonderful?I wish I could say the samefor George Zip.Be patient, Ted. Nobody expects youto get over this immediately.Hey, Striker, how about a break?I'm getting tired.Yeah, all right. Take five.Thanks.I found a wonderful apartment for us.It has a brick fireplaceand a cute bedroomwith mirrors on the ceiling and...Red Leader!Red Leader, I'm going down!Captain Geline. He think he'sa pilot, still fighting the war.I've found the tunnel, Johnson!It's this way!$ for a cigarette is too much! What's his problem? It's Lieutenant Hurwitz.Severe shell shock.He thinks he's Ethel Merman.War is hell.Excuse me, sir. Would youlike coffee before dinner?No. No, thank you. Would you like another cup? I will, but Jim won't.I think I will haveanother cup of coffee.Jim never has a secondcup of coffee at home. Excuse me, sister. Yes?There's a little girlonboard who's ill.Oh, yes, I saw. Poor child.Could I borrow your guitar?I thought maybe I could cheer her up. Of course. Thank you. Hi. Hi.Do you mind if I talkto your daughter?I think that'd would be nice. Hi, I'm Randy. I'm Lisa.Oh, you have a guitar!I thought maybe you'dlike to hear a song.I'd love to.OK. Let's see...This is one of my favorites.You're late. We've been waiting. Who's first? Go ahead, Clarence.How's the weather?We got some heavy stuff ahead.We've got to climb on top.Yeah, after the war, I wantedto get as far away as possible,so Elaine and Ijoined the Peace Corps.We were assignedto an isolated tribe, the Molombos.They'd never seen Americans before.It was really a challenge,introducing themto our western culture.At first, they didn't knowwhat to think of us.But soon, we gained their trust.It'll help you betterprepare storing foodsfor the up and comingmonsoon months.Also, Supperware productsare ideal for storing leftoversto help stretch your food dollar.This twoquart""SealsMRite"" containerkeeps hot dog buns fresh for days.These people had been completelyisolated from civilization.No one had outlined a physicalfitness program for them,and they had no athletic equipment.I started themon simple calisthenics,worked up to rudimentary game skills,and finally,advanced competitive theory.I was patient,and they were eager to learn.They seemed to enjoy themselves.Probably due to advancedAmerican teaching techniques,we bridged the generationsof isolation,and communicated successfullywith the Molombos.They're getting the hang of it.When we reenlist,I'll teach them baseball.Ted, I don't want to stay here.It's time to go hometo the plans we made before the war.A lot of people made plansbefore the war. Like George Zip.At that moment, I realised Elainehad doubts about our relationship.And that, as much as anything else,led to my drinking problem.We did come back to the States.I tried a number of jobs.I could go on,but I'd probably bore you.I couldn't blame Elaine.She wanted a career. I can't stand it. What is it? Yes? It's my stomach.I haven't felt this awfulsince we saw that Ronald Reagan film.I'll see if I can findsome dramamine.Captain, a woman passengeris very sick.Airsick?I think so,but I've never seen it so acute.Find out if a doctor's onboardas quietly as you can.Joey, have you ever beenin a Turkish prison?I shouldn't have hadthat second cup of coffee.Jim never vomits at home.Sorry to wake you.I'm looking for a doctor.There's nothing to worry about.Stewardess, I think the mannext to me is a doctor.Sir, excuse me. Sorry to wake you,are you a doctor? That's right. We have sick passengers. Could you come look at them? Yes. Yes, of course.Let me see your tongue.I'll be back in a minute.Tell the captain to land.She must go to a hospital.A hospital! What is it?It's a big building with patients,but that's not important. I must speak to the captain. Certainly.Victor, we're running into heavy...Roger, take over! Captain, how soon can you land? I can't tell. You can tell me. I'm a doctor. No, I'm not sure. Can't you take a guess? Not for another two hours.You can't take a guessfor another two hours?No, we can't land.Fog has closed down everything.We've got to get through to Chicago.Get him out of there!What is it, Doctor? What's going on?I'm not sure.Haven't seen anything like thissince the Anita Bryant Concert. What did we have for dinner? We had a choice  steak or fish.Yes, I remember. I had Lasagna. What did he have? He had fish.Doctor, two more are sick.The other passengers are worried.We'll handle the passengers.Find out what the sick peoplehad for dinner.This is Captain Oveur speaking.It's bumpy, but we'll be past itin a few minutes.We're now flying over Hoover Dam,and later we'll pass southof the Grand Canyon.Meanwhile, relaxand enjoy your flight, OK?Chicago, this is flight er.We're in trouble.We need traffic below us clearedand priority landing in Chicago.Yes?My husband's very sick.Can you do something?The doctor will be with youin just a moment.Do you know what he had for dinner?Yes, we both had fish. Why?It's nothing to be alarmed about.We'll be back to you very quickly.Doctor, Mr Hammen ate fish,and Randy said there are fivemore cases, and they all had fish.The copilot had fish.What did the navigator have?He had fish.All right, now we knowwhat we're up against.Those who had fish for dinnerwill soon become violently ill. Just how serious is it? Extremely serious.It starts with a slight fever,dryness of the throat.When the virus penetrates,the victim becomes dizzy,and begins to experiencean itching rash.From there, the poison workson the central nervous system,causing severe muscle spasms,followed by the inevitable drooling.At this point,the digestive system collapses,accompaniedby uncontrollable flatulence.Until, finally,the poor bastard is reducedto a quivering,wasted piece of jelly.Put it on... automatic pilot.Automatic pilot, automatic pilot...There it is!I'll go back to the passengers.Come in, er. This is Chicago.Flight er, come in.This is Elaine Dickinson,the stewardess.Captain Oveur's passed out.We've lost the copilotand navigator, too. We're in trouble.Roger. I'm Steve McCroskey,Chicago air control.I'll be back in a moment.Hold all takeoffs.When  reports,bring it straight in.Suspend all meal serviceon flights leaving Los Angeles.Tell all dispatchersto remain at the post. How about coffee? No, thanks.I want the weatheron every available landing field.You understand?Any place availableto land that plane!Go to the towerand get a runway diagram.Check down the fieldfor emergency equipment.Chief, we got fog every placeeast of the Rockies.They'll haveto come through to Chicago.Looks like I picked the wrong weekto quit smoking.Get the best available manwho won't crack under pressure.How about Mr Rogers?Get me Rex Kramer.Next to the throttleis the air speed gauge.What speed does it indicate?  miles per hour. Good. Very good.Now, check your altitude.That's the dial below and rightof the speed indicator., feet.No, wait. , feet.No. It's dropping!It's dropping fast!Why is it doing that?Oh, my God! The automatic pilot,it's deflating!Elaine, don't panic.On his belt linethere's a hollow tube.That's the manual inflation nozzle.Pull it out and blow on it.What the hell's going on up there? Elaine. Yes, Doctor?Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts? No.Unless we hospitalisethose people quickly,I can't be sureof saving their lives.Is there anyone on boardwho can land this plane?Well...No. No one I know of.You ought to know our chances.Our lives depend on just one thing finding someone to fly this planewho didn't have fish for dinner.Ladies and gentlemen,this is your stewardess speaking.We regret any inconveniencethe sudden cabin movement caused.This is due to periodic air pockets.There's no reason to become alarmed.We hope you enjoy your flight.By the way, is there anyoneon board who can fly a plane?Hello. I'm Paul Careyfrom the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer. Yes. Come in, Paul.Rex will be right out.Shep, sit. Sit!I understand there's an emergency.Something like that. There wasn'ttime to tell me very much...Shep, no!I'll bet exciting thingshappen all the time down there.Airline businessdoes have its moments.After a while, you get used to it.Shep! Come!He gets so excitedwhen new people are here. Are you a pilot? No, I'm in...a training program.It's unbelievable.It's just unbelievable.How many times have I warnedabout food inspection?You'd thinksomeone would listen to you.Well, airport management,the FAA, and the airlines...they're all cheats and liars.All right. Let's get out of here.I'm sorry, I was just lookingfor someone with flying experience.When they built those roads,they didn't think about drainage,so we had to take a special jeepup to the main road.We were lucky to get a jeep,since, just the day before,only one we had broke down.It had a bad axle...Excuse me, sir.There's a problem in the cockpit.The cockpit? What is it?The little room where the pilot sits.That's not important.The first officer is ill,and the captain needs someoneto help him with the radio.Do you know anything about planes?I flew in the war years ago.I wouldn't know anything about it.Would you go up, please?The stewardess said... Both pilots? Can you fly this plane and land it?Surely, you can't be serious.I am serious,and don't call me Shirley.Doctor, I've checked everyone.Mr Striker's the only one.What's your flying experience?I flew singleengine fighters,but this plane has four engines.It's an entirely differentkind of flying... altogether.It's an entirely differentkind of flying.I haven't touchedany kind of plane in six years.Mr Striker,I know nothing about flying.You're the only one on this planewho can possibly fly it.You're the only chance we've got.That's right. That's what I said.You heard me.Tell Omaha to acknowledgeand stand by.Every pieceof emergency equipment available.Alert rescue units every mileof the way, from here to the Rockies.Chief!We'll needa freelanding flight check. Fast. It's your wife. I want the kids in bed by nine,the dog fed, the yard watered,the gate locked.Get a note to the milkman ""No more cheese.""Where the hell is Kramer?No, he can't do that.The risk of a flameout's too great.Keep him at ,... No, feet.A passenger is goingto land that plane. Is that possible? It's a hundred to one shot. I know this guy. You do? Who is it?Ted striker.I flew with him during the war.It won't make my job easier.Ted Striker was a crackflight leader.He was one of those men who...felt too much inside.Maybe you know that kind.He went all to pieceson a particular mission.Let's just hopethat doesn't happen tonight.Let's see... Altitude, , feet.Level flight. Speed,  knots.Course Zero Niner Zero.Trim, mixture.Wash, soap, rinse, spin.Ted! What are you doing here?You can't fly this plane!That's what I'm trying to tell them.Elaine. I don't have time to begentle, so I'll be very direct.Everyone is in a desperate situation.Mr Striker is the only hope we got.Those are the flaps.This is the thrust.This must turn on the landing lights. Mayday! Mayday! Mayday? What the hell is that?May Day's the Russian new year.We'll have a big parade and serve...I can't stand it any more.I've got to get out of here!Calm down! Get a hold of yourself! Please let me handle this. I've got to get out...Calm down. Get to your seat.I'll handle it.Calm down. Get ahold of yourself.Doctor, you're wanted on the phone.Everything will be all right. Sister, I can handle this. Got to get out of here!We'd like you to have this flower.Excuse me, sir, would you...Donations for Reverend Moon?Jews for Jesus?Read about Jehovah's Witness?How about Buddhism?Help Jerry's kids? Scientology? For nuclear power?Your attention, please.Nofrills passengers now arriving.Please have your baggageclaim checks ready to showupon leaving the terminal.This guy has no airline experience.He's a menaceto everything in the air.Yes, birds, too.OK, he's a terrible risk,but what other choice have we got?That's the whole story, Rex.Everything we know.Let's face a few facts.I flew with Striker during the war.He can't afford to worry about thosetimes when... things weren't so good. Right now things aren't so good. Let me tell you something.Striker was a topnotchsquadron leader long ago.Get on the hornand talk that guy down.Let him get the feelof that airplane,then you'll have to talk himright down to the ground.Very well.Put Striker on the speaker.Use my radio.I took the wrong weekto quit drinking.You can work them directfrom here, Captain.Striker? Striker, this isCaptain Rex Kramer speaking.Yes, Captain Kramer.Read you loud and clear.All right.It's obvious you remember me.What do you say we forget abouteverything, except what we must do?Let's not kid each other, Kramer.You know I've never flowna bucket like this. I'll need all the luck there is. Stand by, Striker.Our one hope is to build this man up.I've got to give him confidence.Striker, you ever flowna multiengine plane? No, never. Shit! It's a goddamn waste of time.There's no way he can land it!You got to talk him down! You got to!Route him into Lake Michigan. Atleast avoid killing innocent people.You're the only chance they've got.All right.Striker, you listen,and you listen close.Flying a planeis like riding a bicycle.It's just harderto put baseball cards in the spokes.First, get the feel of the plane.Later, we'll run downthe landing procedure.All right.Disengage the automatic pilot.Make no violent control movementslike you did in the fighter planes.All right.I'll unlock the automatic pilot.The controls will feel very heavycompared to a fighter.Don't worry about that.It's perfectly normal.Now, one more thing.Can somebody work the radioand leave you free for flying?The stewardess is here with me.Good. Have her sitin the copilot seat.Elaine, he wants youto sit in the copilot seat.What's going on?We have a right to know the truth.All right, I'll level with you all.The most important thingis that you remain calm.There's no reason to panic.It's trueone of the crew members is ill.Slightly ill.The other two pilots are fine.They're flying the plane,free to pursuea life of religious fulfilment.The radio is all yours. Keep an eyeon number three engine gauge.It's running a little hot.Striker,first I'd like to say something.I know things must lookpretty rough up there.If you do what I tell youwhen I tell you,there's no reasonyou should lack confidencein your chances of coming outalive and in one piece.What weather are you in? Rain. And a little ice.And a little ice. How's it handling? Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.All right, Striker.You're doing just fine.It's damn goodhe doesn't know I hate his guts.It's damn goodyou don't know he hates your guts.Can I get you something?I'm sorry. I don't understand. Stewardess. I speak jive. Good.He said he's in great pain,and he wants to knowif you can help him?Tell him to relax.I'll be back with some medicine.Call Captain Oveur's wifeand let her know what's going on.This weather bulletinjust came off the wire.What can you make out of this?This? I can make a hator a brooch or pterodactyl... Hello? Mrs Oveur?Yes, this is Mrs Oveur.This is Ed Maciascalling from the airport.There's troubleon your husband's flight.We don't know how serious it is,but Steve McCroskey thought you'dwant to come over right away.Yes. I'll be right down.I've got to go to the airport.You can let yourselfout the back door.There's juice in the refrigerator.Doctor says the sick peopleare getting worse.We're running out of time.I've got to concentrate.I've got to concentrate.Hello?Echo!Pinch hitting for Pedro Bourbone,Manny Mota. How you doing, honey? Jack, I'm so hot, I'm burning up.I'll turn on some air. What's going on? Close the window!Chicago,the passengers are panicking.When do we start down?Not yet. You'll be in radar rangeany second now.They should have been in range minutes ago.Gunderson, check the radar range.Anything yet?About two more minutes, chief.Two minutes?They could be miles off course.Impossible! They're on instruments.This is going to be a real sweat.Gunderson,let me know when you get anything.Got a cigarette, Nels?I can't take much more of this.Looks like I picked the wrong weekto quit amphetamines. Johnny, how about some more coffee? No, thanks.These reporters want a statement. How much longer can they hold out? ,  minutes. Who's flying the plane? A passenger.He's an experienced air force pilot.No cause for alarm. Take over. What kind of plane?It's a big, pretty white planewith red stripes,curtains and wheels.It looks like a big tylenol.OK, boys. Let's get some pictures.This bulletin just handed to me.Stricken airlinerapproaching Chicago...Shana, they bought their tickets.They knew whatthey were getting into.I say, let them crash! Would you like some whisky, ma'am? Certainly not!How are the passengers?I won't deceive you, Mr Striker.We're running out of time.Surely, there's something you can do.I'm doing everything I can...and stop calling me Shirley.Randy, are you all right?Oh, Dr Rumack.I'm scared.I've never been so scared...And besides,I'm  and I'm not married.We're going to make it.You've got to believe that.Dr Rumack, do you have any ideawhen we'll be landing?Pretty soon. How are you bearing up?To be honest,I've never been so scared,but at least I have a husband.Stay in formation.Target's just ahead.Target should be clearif you go in low enough.You'll have to decide.You'll have to decide.You'll have to decide.Stay in formation.Target's just ahead.Target should be clearif you go in low enough.You'll have to decide.You'll have to decide.You'll have to decide.Oh, rats! Lost number four.What happened? What went wrong?I forgot to check the oil pressure.When Kramer hears about this,the shit's going to hit the fan.I told him to watch thatoil temperature. What's he doing?Stiker, that plane can't land itself.Ease off. It's not his fault.It could happen to any pilot.It happened to Barbara Stanwyck.Can't push him too hard. Might break.Remember who you're dealing with.Nick, Pete, Jerry,there's a fire in the barn.He's right.I can't take the pressure.I was crazy to thinkI could land this plane. But, Ted, you're the only... I don't care.I don't have what it takes.They would be better off with someonewho's never flown before.Bad news. Fog's getting thicker.And Leon's getting larger.I know what you're going to say,so save your breath.Well, I don't have a thing to say.You've done the best you could.You really have. The best you could.We can't expect to win them all.I want to tell you something I'vekept to myself through these years.I was in the war. Medical corps.One night, they brought ina badly wounded pilot from one raid.He could barely talk.He looked up at me, he said,""The odds were against us there,but we went in anyway.""I'm glad.Captain made the right decision.""The pilot's name was George Zip.George Zip said that?The last thing he said to me,""Doc,"" he said, ""Sometime...""...the crew is up against it.""The breaks are beating the boys.""Tell them to give it all they've got""and win just one for the Zipper.""I don't knowwhere I'll be then,"" he said...""but I won't smell too good,that's for sure.""Excuse me, doc.I've got a plane to land.You'd better stay up there a bit.When the fog lifts,we'll bring you in.I'll take it, Elaine.Listen, Dr Rumack says the sickpeople are in critical condition.Every minute counts.We've got to land now.Don't be a fool, Striker. You knowwhat landing like this means.I'm ordering you to stay up there.No dice, Chicago.I'm giving the orders,and we're coming in.I guess the foot'son the other hand now.He'll never make it in this soup.But it's his ship now.He's in charge.He's boss, head man, top dog,big cheese, head honcho...Captain, look at this.""Passengers certain to die.""""Airline negligent.""There's a sale at Penny's!I'll need three men in the tower.You, Neubauer, you, Macias.Me John. Big tree.Striker, we're going to the tower.Good luck.They're going to the tower.The tower! The tower!Rapunzel! Rapunzel!Stewardess, how soon till we land?It won't be long now.Try not to worry.We're all ready, sir.Captain McCroskey,this is Captain Roberts.Captain Kramer,this is Captain Colosimo.Captain Hinshaw,this is Captain Gantz.Captain Kramer, Captain Gantz.Captain Hinshaw, Captain Roberts.Colosimo, you work the relay.Roberts, check air traffic.Get that finger out of your ear.You don't know where it's been. Steve! Got a cigarette, Nels?Linda, your husband and the othersare alive but unconscious.Just like Gerald Ford.There's a chance we can save themif Striker lands that plane in time.That isn't much of a chance.I don't know. We're doingeverything we can. Now excuse me.Where did you get that dress?It's awful!And those shoes and that coat! Geez! miles. Turn right to heading .We're now at , feetbeginning our descent. Pour every light onto that field. It's being done.Tower to emergency vehicles,runway is niner.Airport vehicles,take positions one and two.Civilian equipment, number three.Air force, positions four and five.All ambulances go to number three.Air Israel, please clear the runway.In a moment, we'll ask youto assume crash positions.Life jackets are under your seat.Place it over your head.When I give the word,pull the cord on the right side flap.Your seat cushions are also equippedwith a flotation device.WZAZ in Chicago,where disco lives forever.Your altitude's too erratic.You can't come straight in.You've got enough fuel for two hours.I'll take it, Elaine.Listen to me, Kramer.We have people up here who will diein less than an hour.I may bend your precious airplane,but I'll get it down. The passengers are ready. Thanks, Randy.You better leave, sweetheart.You might get hurt up here. Ted... Yes?I wanted you to know... now...I'm very proud.Tell them the gear is downand we're ready to land.The gear is down,and we're ready to land.He's on final now.Put out all runway lightsexcept niner.Captain, maybe we oughtto turn on the searchlights.No.That's just what they'llbe expecting us to do.I want to tell you both good luck.We're all counting on you.Now listen carefully.You'll see the runway at  feet.Touch down a third of the way.A slight cross wind, so be ready.Land too fast,use your emergency brakes.Red handle's right in front.If that doesn't stop you...If that doesn't stop you,cut the four ignition switches.Can you see us now? You shouldbe able to see the field. Sure is quiet out there. Yeah, too quiet.Looks like I picked the wrong weekto quit sniffing glue.There it is.There he is!Striker, you're coming in too fast.I know, I know!He knows, he knows!Below  now. Still going down., , , he's holding.No, he's down, he's down.Sound your alarm now.Now, everybody,get in crash positions.Put down  degrees of flap.All right, listen to me.Remember your brakes and switches.Get ready to flare it out!He's all over the place. up to , feet.What an asshole.More left rudder. Put down more flap.Just kidding!Striker, lift your nose.Straighten your wings.Coming in too fast. Watch your speed.He's coming right at us!Coming in too hot.Ease up on the throttle.Watch out for that cross wind.Level it out.You'll have to dip your left wing.You're drifting. Keep your eyeson the far end of the runway.You're too low, damn it!Watch your stall speed.Flare it out!Ease her down. Down!The brake! Pull the red handle!I want to tell you both good luck.We're all counting on you.Flight  now arrivingat gate eight.Gate nine.Gate ten.Pull out of it! Push that button!Gate ... Gate .Gate ...Auntie Em! Toto! It's a twister!Gate , , ...I want to tell you both good luck.We're all counting on you.Striker? Striker, are you all right? Yeah. We're OK.Ted, that was probablythe lousiest landingin the history of this airport.But some of us, particularly me,would like to buy you adrink and shake your hand.And, Ted, when the going got rough...Have a nice day. OK.Have a nice day and thank youfor flying TransAmerican.Loneliness, that's the bottom line.I was never happy as a child.Christmas,what does that mean to you?Mine was living hell.Do you know what it's liketo fall in the mudand get kicked in the headby an iron boot?Of course not. It never happens.Sorry. That's a dumb question.Skip that.There you go. Have a nice day.Municipal bonds, Ted.Talking double ""A"" rating.Best investment in America.Well, I'll give himanother  minutes, but that's it."

That's yours.From now on,you better be looking behind you when you walk.Because one day you're gonna geta bullet in your back.Doc!Marty, I gave you explicit instructionsnot to come here......but to go directly back to .I know, but I had to come.It's good to see you, Marty.You've got to do somethingabout those clothes.Dressed like that, you're liable to get shot.Or hanged.What idiot dressed you in that outfit?You did.""Shot in the back by Buford Tannenover a matter of $""?""September ""?That's this Monday!Now I wish I'd paid him off.Who's this ""beloved Clara""?I don't know anyone named Clara.I don't know, Doc.I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours.My involvement in such a social relationship......here in ......could result in a disruptionof the spacetime continuum.As a scientist......I can never take that risk.Certainly not afterwhat we've already been through.Emmett! Hello, Emmett.Hubert.It's the mayor.Excuse me, Emmett.Do you remember last weekwhen you volunteered......to meet the new schoolteacherat the station?Yes, quite so.We just got word she's coming in tomorrow.Here are the details for you.Thanks for all your help.Anytime, Hubert.Oh!Her name's Miss Clara Clayton.Well, Doc......now we know who Clara is.Marty, it's impossible.The idea that I could fall in loveat first sight is romantic nonsense.There's no scientific rationalefor that concept.It's not science.You meet the right girl, it hits you like lightning.Please, don't say that.That's the way it was for me and Jennifer.We couldn't keep our eyes off each other.God, Jennifer, I hope she's all right.I can't believe we just left her on the porch.Don't worry. She'll be fine.When you burned the almanac in ,the normal timeline was restored.Once we're back in ......you just have to go to her houseto wake her up.Turn that valve over there,all the way to the right.Yeah, pull it all the way around.Let's go!Ice tea?No, thanks.It's a refrigerator.I guess Miss Claytonwill have to find other transportation.If I never meet her, there's no possibilityof a romantic infatuation.You're the doc.All right.We'll get the DeLorean and get back to the future.I tore a hole in the gas tankwhen I was landing......so we'll have to patch it upand get some gas.You mean, we're out of gas?Yeah. It's no big deal.We've got Mr. Fusion, right?Mr. Fusion powers the time circuitsand the flux capacitor.But the internal combustion engineruns on ordinary gasoline.It always has.There won't be a gas station around hereuntil sometime in the next century.Without gasoline,we can't get the DeLorean up to  mph.So what do we do?Twentyfour!It's no use, Marty!Even the fastest horse in the worldwon't run more than ,  miles an hour!Bartender said that's the strongest stuff they got.Try it, Marty.Give it more gas!Damn!It blew the fuel injection manifold.Strong stuff, all right.It will take me a month to rebuild it.A month?You're gonna get shot on Monday!I know!I wish...Wait.I've got it! We can roll it down a steep hill!We'll never find a smooth enough surface.Unless...Of course! Ice!We'll wait until winterwhen the lake freezes over.Winter? What are you saying?Monday is three days away!All right. Let's just thinkthis thing through logically.We know it won't run under its own power.We know we can't pull it.But if we could figure out a way......to push it up to  miles an hour...That's it.How fast can she go?Why, I've had her up to  myself.I heard that Fearless Frank Fargogot one of these up to near ......out past Verde Junction.Do you think it's possible to get it up to ?Ninety? Tarnation.Who would ever need to be in such a hurry?Just a little bet he and I have, that's all.Theoretically speaking, could it be done?I suppose, if you had a straightstretch of track with a level grade......and you weren't hauling no cars......and if you could get the fire hot enough.I'm talking about hotter than the blazesof Hell itself.It might be possible to get her up that fast.When does the next train come through?Monday morning at :.Here. This spur that runsoff the main line  miles out to Clayton Ravine.It's a long stretch of level trackthat will still exist in .This is where we'll push the DeLoreanwith the locomotive.Funny. This map calls Clayton Ravine""Shonash Ravine.""That must be the old Indian name for it.It's perfect.A long run that goesacross the bridge over the ravine......over near that Hilldale housing development.Right, but according to this map......there is no bridge.Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea.We can't wait for this thing to get finished.Marty, it's perfect.You're not thinking fourth dimensionally.Right. I have a problem with that.Don't you see? The bridge will exist in .It's safe and still in use.As long as we get the DeLoreanup to  miles an hour......before we hit the edge of the ravine......we'll instantaneously arrive at a pointin time where the bridge is completed.We'll have track under usand coast safely across the ravine.What about the train?It will be a spectacular wreck.Too bad no one will be around to see it.Help me!Great Scott!Hurry!Jump!Thank you, sir. You saved my......life.Emmett Brown at your service, Miss...Clayton.Clara Clayton.Clara?What a beautiful name.May I help you inside with these?That won't be necessary. I can take care of it.You've done more than enough already.But it's really no trouble.She says it's fine, and we have to get going.Ma'am, good luckwith your school teaching and everything.Clara.I'll straighten everything outfor the buckboard rental.Don't worry about that.I feel somewhat responsible for what happened.That would be very gentlemanly of you,Mr. Brown. Emmett.You know, I'm almost gladthat snake spooked those horses.Otherwise, we might never have met.I suppose it was destiny.Thank you for everything.You're quite welcome.I will see you again, won't I?Of course. You'll see lots of me.I have a shop in town.I'm the local scientist, I mean, blacksmith.What sort of science?Astronomy? Chemistry?Actually, I'm a student of all sciences.Doc, we have to get going.Yes. Excuse us, Clara.We have to get going.Toodleoo.What do you mean,you'll be seeing lots of her?I might see her again just in passing.Did you see the way she was looking at you?She did have quite a scare, right?Miss Clayton almost ended upat the bottom of Clayton Ravine.Holy shit.Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher.They say she fell in there  years ago. years ago!That's this year!Every kid knows that story.We all have teachers we'd like to seefall into the ravine.Great Scott!Then she was supposed to go overin that wagon.Now I may have seriously altered history.Look, Doc, what's the worse that can happen?So they don't name the ravine after her.Let's get the DeLorean readyand get out of here.I wish I'd never inventedthat infernal time machine.It's caused nothing but disaster.Doc, this is Marty.Do you read me? Over.Check, Marty.Great. These things still work.All right. Once more,let's go over the entire plan and layout.I apologize for the crudity of this model...Yeah, it's not to scale. It's okay.All right. Tomorrow night, Sunday......we load the DeLoreanonto the tracks here, on the spur......by the abandoned silver mine.The switch track is where the spur runsoff the main line......three miles out to Clayton... Shonash Ravine.The train leaves the stationat : Monday morning.We'll stop it, uncouple the cars,throw the switch track and then hijack......borrow the locomotive and use itto push the time machine.According to my calculations we'll reach mph just before we hit......the edge of the ravine,at which point we'll be transported back to ......and coast safely across the completed bridge.What does this mean? ""Point of no return.""That's our failsafe point.Till there, we have time to stop the locomotivebefore it plunges into the ravine.But once we pass this windmill,it's the future or bust.Here you go.Connect that to the positive terminal.All right, you all set?Yeah. Go!Train pulling out of the station!Coming up to the switch track!Stop at the switch track!Throw the switch!Pull up to the DeLorean!Pushing the DeLorean......up to  miles per hour!It couldn't be simpler.Emmett?It's Clara.Quick, cover the DeLorean!Hello.Why, hello.This is quite a surprise.I hope I'm not disturbing anything.We were just doing a little model railroading.When my bags were thrown from the wagon......my telescope was damaged.Since you mentioned an interest in science......I thought you might be able to repair it for me.I would pay you, of course.I wouldn't think of charging you for this.Let's have a look at it.I think a lens may be out of alignment because......if you move it this way the image turns fuzzy.See?But if you turn it the other way......then...Everything becomes......clear.I could repair it right awayand have it for you tonight.Tonight is the town festival.I wouldn't dream of having you workon my telescope during such an occasion.You are planning on attending, aren't you?Actually, ma'am...Yes, of course. The festival.In that case,I'll see you this evening at the festival.Mr. Eastwood.Ma'am.Thank you for taking care of my telescope.You're quite welcome.It's a nice telescope.Ladies and gentlemen......as mayor of Hill Valley......it gives me great pleasureto dedicate this clock......to the people of Hill County!May it stand for all time!Tell me when, gentlemen.Three! Two! One!Now!Let the festivities begin!In a way, it's fitting that you and Iare here to witness this.It's too bad I didn't bring my camera.Ready, gentlemen?The only problem is,we'll never be able to show it to anybody.Smile, Doc.What great music!Yeah, it's got a beat, and you can dance to it.Step right up and test your mettlewith the latest products......from Col. Samuel Colt's PatentFirearms Manufacturing Company......of Hartford, Connecticut.Now, take this model, for example.The new,improved and refined Colt Peacemaker......selling to you tonight for the low price of $.Good evening.'Evening.You look very nice.Thank you.Would you like...Would you care to...I'd love to.Young man, you want to give it a try?No, thanks.Doc, this...Son!Sonny boy!Doc can dance?Son.I just told you that even a babycould handle this weapon.Surely you're not afraid to try.I'm not afraid of nothing.Come on, then.Just step up here like a man.Now, young man, what you dois just ease that hammer back and......squeeze off a round.Right on out there and be real smooth.That's the way you do it.Can I try that again?Yeah, go ahead.Tell me one thing.Where did you learn to shoot like that?Eleven.Buford, you sure that blacksmithwill be at this shindig?Sure he's here. Everybody's here tonight.You'll have to check your firearmsif you want to join in on the festivities.Who's gonna make us, tenderfoot?I am.Marshal Strickland.I didn't know you was back in town.If you can't read the sign,I presume you can read this.Pretty tough hombre when you're pointinga gun at a man's back.Just like you, I take every advantage I can get.You gonna check your iron?I was just joking with your deputy.Of course, I'm gonna check my iron.We all were, weren't we, boys?Yeah, right.Tannen.Your knife, too.Smile, Marshal.After all, this is a party.Only party I'll be smiling at......is the one that sees you at the end of a rope.Have fun!That's how you handle them.Never give them an inch......and maintain discipline at all times.Remember that word: discipline.I will, Pa.Thank you very much.Mr. Eastwood, nice to see you.I see you got yourselfsome respectable clothes and a fine hat.A couple people didn't like the waythe other one looked on me.That one suits you.It's very becoming.Thanks.""Frisbee."" Far out.What was the meaning of that?It was right in front of him.That's mine!Not anymore.Give me that.There he is, Buford.Where?There.Dancing with that piece of calico.What are you gonna do, boss?I figure if I bury this muzzle deep enoughin his back nobody will hear the shot.Careful. You've only got one bullet with that.I only need one.I told you to watch your back, smithy.You're early.It's a Derringer. Small but effective.The last time I used it, fella took two days to die.Bled to death inside. It was real painful.That means you'll be deadby about supper time Monday.Excuse me. I don't knowwho you think you are, but we're dancing.Look what we have here.Ain't you gonna introduce me?I'd like a dance.I wouldn't give you the pleasure.You'll have to go ahead and shoot.All right.I'll dance with him.Boys, keep the blacksmith companywhile I get acquainted with the filly!Yeah!I don't dance very wellwhen my partner has a gun in his hand.You'll learn.Maybe I'll just takemy $ worth out of her!Leave her alone!Yeah, I bet there's something you can dothat's worth $.I believe you've underestimated me, mister.Have I?Stop it!Damn you!No, I damn you!I damn you to hell!You.Lighten up, jerk!Mighty strong words, runt!You man enough to back them upwith more than just a pie plate?Just leave my friends alone.What's wrong, dude? You yellow?That's what I thought. A yellowbelly.Nobody calls me yellow.Then let's finish it. Right now.Not now, Buford. Marshal's got our guns.Like I said, we'll finish this tomorrow!Tomorrow we're robbing the Pine City stage.What about Monday?We doing anything Monday?Monday would be fine.You can kill him on Monday.I'll be back this way on Monday.We'll settle this then.Right there, out in the street......in front of the Palace Saloon.Yeah, right. When?High noon?Noon?I do my killing before breakfast. :!:. I do my killing after breakfast.Marty!Break it up.What's all this about?You causing trouble here, Tannen?No trouble, Marshal.Just a little personal matterbetween me and Eastwood.This don't concern the law.Tonight, everything concerns the law.Break it up.Any brawling, it's  days in the county jail.All right, folks. This is a party.Come on! Let's have some fun!: Monday, runt.If you ain't here, I'll hunt youand shoot you down like a duck.It's ""dog."" Shoot him down like a dog.Let's go, boys!Let these sissies have their party!What are you doing, saying you'll meet Tannen?Don't worry about it.Monday morning we'll be gone.Theoretically, yes. But what if the train's late?We'll discuss this later.We'll discuss it now.Thank you for your gallantry.Ma'am.Had you not interceded,Emmett might have been shot.Marty... Clint, I'm gonna take Clara home.Right. Good night.You sure set him straight.I'm glad somebody finally stood upto that son of a bitch.You're all right in my book.I'd like to buy you a drink.You don't have to buy me anything.It was no big deal...You can have this brandnewColt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge.Free?I want everybody to knowthe gun that shot Buford Tannen......was a Colt Peacemaker!No problem. Thanks a lot.Of course, if you lose, I'm taking it back.Thanks again.You had him.You could have walked away and nobodywould have thought less of you.All it would have been was words,hot air from a buffoon.Instead, you let him rile you......into playing his game, his way, by his rules.Seamus, relax. I know what I'm doing.He reminds me of poor Martin.Aye.Who?Me brother.Wait a minute.You have a brother named Martin McFly?Had a brother.Martin used to let menprovoke him into fighting.He was concerned peoplewould think him a coward if he refused.That's how he got a knife shoved throughhis belly in a saloon in Virginia City.Never considered the future, poor Martin.God rest his soul.Sure, and I hope you'reconsidering the future, Mr. Eastwood.I think about it all the time.That crater all by itself, like a starburst.Yeah.That one's called Copernicus.Listen to me. I feel like I'm teaching school.Please, continue the lesson.I never found lunar geography so fascinating.You're quite knowledgeable.When I was , I had diphtheria.I was quarantined for three months.My father brought this telescopeand put it next to my bed......so I could see everything out the window.Do you think we'll ever travel to the moon......the way we travelacross the country on trains?Definitely. Although not for  years,and not on trains.We'll have space capsules sent aloftwith rockets......devices that create giant explosionsso powerful they just...That they break the pull of gravityand send the projectile to outer space.Emmett!I read that book, too!You're quoting Jules Verne,From the Earth to the Moon.You've read Jules Verne?I adore Jules Verne.So do I., Leagues Under the Sea.My absolute favorite.The first time I read that as a little boy,I wanted to meet Captain Nemo.Don't tease. You couldn't have read thatwhen you were a boy.It was only first published  years ago.Yes. I meant it made me feel like a boy.I never met a womanwho liked Jules Verne before.I never ever met a man like you before.Doc?Doc?Hope you know what you're doing.You talking to me?You talking to me, Tannen?I'm the only one here.Go ahead! Make my day.Good morning.'Morning.Have a cigar. Anything I can do for you today?No, that's fine.Good luck tomorrow.We'll be praying for you.Thanks.Good morning.Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?I'm fine. Thanks.What are you doing?Nothing.I was just out enjoying the morning air.It's really lovely here in the morning.Don't you think?Yes. We've got to load the DeLoreanand get ready to roll.Look at that, the tombstone.Let me see that photograph again.My name, it's vanished.That's great, Doc.We're going back to the future tomorrow,so everything's being erased.But only my name is erased.The tombstone itself and the date still remain.That doesn't make sense.We know this photograph representswhat will happen......if the events of today continueto run their course into tomorrow.Right. So?Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood.I just need to take your measurements.Look, pal, I don't want to buy a suit.This is for your coffin.My coffin?The odds are running  against you.Might as well be prepared.So it may not be my name......that's going to be on this tombstone.It may be yours.Great Scott.I know, this is heavy.Why are you wearing that gun? You'renot considering going up against Tannen?Tomorrow morning I'm goingback to the future with you.But if Buford Tannen comes looking for trouble,I'll be ready for him.You heard what that son of a bitch called me.You can't lose your judgment over names.That's exactly what causes youto get in that accident in the future.What? What about my future?I can't tell you. It might make things worse.Wait a minute.What is wrong with my future?We all have to make decisionsthat affect the course of our lives.You've got to do what you've got to do......and I've got to do what I've got to do.Marty.Yeah?I've made a decision.I'm not going with you tomorrow.I'm staying here.What are you talking about?There's no point in denying it.I'm in love with Clara.Oh, man.We don't belong here.Neither one of us.It could still be you that gets shot tomorrow.This tombstone could still be in your future.Marty, the future isn't written.It can be changed. You know that.Anyone can make their futurewhatever they want it to be.I can't let this one little photographdetermine my entire destiny.I have to live my lifeaccording to what I believe is right......in my heart.Doc, you're a scientist.So you tell me.What's the right thing to do, up here?You're right, Marty.That worked great.I've at least got to tell her goodbye.Come on, Doc.Think about it. What will you say to her?""I've got to go back to the future""?She won't understand that.Hell, I'm in it with you,and I don't even understand it.Doc.Listen.Maybe we...Maybe we can just take Clara with us.To the future?As you reminded me, I'm a scientist,so I must be scientific about this.I cautioned you about disruptingthe continuum for your own benefit.Therefore, I must do no less.We shall proceed as planned,and as soon as we return to ......we'll destroy this infernal machine.Traveling through timehas become much too painful.It's Emmett, Clara.Emmett, won't you come in?No, I better not. I...What's wrong?I've come to say goodbye.Goodbye? Where are you going?I'm going away.I'm afraid I'll never see you again.Emmett.Clara, I want you to knowthat I care about you deeply.But I've realized that I don't belong here,and I have to go back where I came from.Where might that be?I can't tell you.Then wherever you're going, take me with you.I can't, Clara.I wish it didn't have to be this way......but believe me when I tell youthat I'll never forget you......and that I love you.I don't understand what you're trying to say.Clara.I don't think there's any waythat you can understand it.Please, I have to know.If you sincerely do love me,then tell me the truth.All right then.I'm from the future.I came here in a time machinethat I invented......and tomorrow I have to go backto the year .Yes, Emmett.I do understand.I understand that because you knowI'm partial to the writings of Jules Verne......you concocted those mendacitiesin order to take advantage of me.I've heard some whoppers in my day......but the fact that you'd expect meto believe this......is so insulting and degrading!All you had to say is, ""I don't love youand I don't want to see you anymore.""That, at least, would have been respectful!But that's not the truth.Good to see you, too.Emmett. What can I get you, the usual?No, Chester, I'll need somethinga lot stronger than that tonight.Sarsaparilla.Whiskey, Chester.Whiskey? Are you sure?You know what happened to youon the Fourth of July.Whiskey.Okay, I ain't your papa.Just don't want to see you do the wrong thing.You can leave the bottle.It's a woman, right?I knew it. I've seen that lookon a man's face......a thousand times all across the country.All I can tell you, friend,is you'll get over her.Clara was one in a million.One in a billion. One in a googolplex.The woman of my dreams,and I've lost her for all time.I can assure you, sir, there are other women.Peddling this barbed wireacross the country......has taught me one thing for certain......it's that you never knowwhat the future might bring.The future. I can tell you about the future.Man, did I sleep.What time is it, Doc?Doc!Wake up!Get up! Let's go!I got me a runt to kill.It's still early, boss. What's your hurry?I'm hungry.And in the future, we don't need horses.We have motorized carriagescalled automobiles.If everybody's got one of these auto whatsits......does anybody walk or run anymore?Of course they run, but for recreation, for fun.Run for fun?What the hell kind of fun is that?Doc!How much has he had?None. That's the first one,and he hasn't touched it yet.He just likes to hold it.Doc!What are you doing?I've lost her, Marty.There's nothing left for me here.That's why you gotta come back with me.Where?Back to the future!Right! Let's get going!Great.Gentlemen, excuse me.My friend and I have to catch a train.Here's to you, blacksmith.And to the future.Amen.Amen.Emmett, no!Doc!Come on, Doc. Wake up! Wake up, Doc!How many did he have?Just the one.Just the one? Come on, Doc.There's a fellow that can't hold his liquor.Get me some black coffee!Joey, coffee!Ma'am?How far does the : train go?San Francisco is the end of the line.I'll take a oneway ticket.To sober him up in a hurry,you need something a lot stronger than coffee.What do you suggest?Joey, let's make some wakeup juice.Come on, Doc, swallow.In about  minutes......he's gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday.Ten minutes!Why do we cut these things so damn close?Here, stick this clothespin on his nose.When he opens up his mouth,go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.Stand back.He's still out!That was just a reflex action.It'll take a few more minutesfor the stuff to clear up his head.Perfect.Come on, Doc. Wake up, buddy.Wake up, Doc!Seamus?Wouldn't expect to see you here this morning.Aye. Something inside me told meI should be here......as if my future had something to do with it.He'll come around in a minute. Come on.Come on, Doc. Let's go!Let's wake up now, buddy.Are you in there, Eastwood?It's : and I'm calling you out.It's not : yet!It is by my watch!Let's settle this once and for all, runt!Or ain't you got the gumption?Listen.I'm not really feeling up to this today.So I'll have to forfeit.Forfeit?What's that mean?It means that you win without a fight.Without shooting? He can't do that.You can't do that!You know what I think?I think you ain't nothing but a gutless,yellow turd!I'm giving you to the count of to come out here and prove I'm wrong!One!Doc, come on, sober up, buddy.Two!You better get out there, son.I got $ gold bet on you, so don't let me down.Three!I got $ gold bet against you,so don't let me down.Four!You better face up to it, son,because if you don't go out there...What?Five!What if I don't go out there?You're a coward.Six!And you'll be branded a cowardfor the rest of your days!Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood......is the biggest yellowbelly in the West!Seven!Here!Eight!I already got a gun.Nine!Ten!Do you hear me, runt?I said that's ,you gutless, yellow pieslinger!He's an asshole!I don't care what Tannen says!I don't care what anybody else says either.Doc, you okay?I think so.What a headache!You got a back door to this place?It's in the back.Let's go.Are you coming out hereor do I have to come in after you?The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.Hey!Reach, blacksmith!Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night......had the worst case of broken heartI have ever seen.When he said he didn't knowhow he could live the rest of his life......knowing how much hurthe'd caused that little girl......I really felt for him, I did, right here.Listen up, Eastwood!I aim to shoot somebody today,and I prefer it'd be you.But if you're just too damn yellow......it'll just have to be your blacksmith friend.Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!You got one minute to decide.You hear me, runt? One minute!I've never seen a man so broken upover a woman:What did he say her name was?Cara? Sara?Clara.Clara.Excuse me.Ma'am?Was this man tall,with great big brown puppydog eyes......and long silvery, flowing hair?You know him.Emmett!Time's up, runt!Prepare to meet your maker, blacksmith.Right here, Tannen!Draw!No!I thought we could settle this like men.You thought wrong, dude.Thank you.That was good.You know what I think?I think Buford's going to jail.Yeah.Get him out of that shit.Get them!Buford Tannen, you're under arrestfor robbing the Pine City stage.You got anything to say?I hate manure.Look!Yes!The train!Can we make it?We'll have to cut them off at Coyote Pass.Hey, mister. Mr. Eastwood.Here's your gun, mister.Thanks, kid.Seamus.It's worth $. Never been used.Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat.Right! Take care of that baby!I will!Emmett!Emmett!Emmett!""Time machine.""Come on!Go!Give me your hand!Come on!Come on, Marty.Come on. Let's go!Masks on.Reach!Is this a holdup?It's a science experiment.Stop the train just before you hitthe switch track up ahead.Doc!Uncouple the cars from the tender!I've wanted to do that all my life.What are these things?My version of Presto Logs.Compressed wood with anthracite dust......chemically treated to burn hotter and longer.I use them so I don't have to stoke my forge.These three will ignite sequentially......make the fire hotter,kick up the boiler pressure......and make the train go faster.Ready to roll!Emmett!Marty, are the time circuits on?Check!Input the destination time:October , , : a.m.Check. We're cruisingat a steady  miles an hour.I'm throwing in the Presto Logs.The new dashboard gaugewill tell us the boiler temperature.It's colorcoded to indicatewhen each log will fire.Green, yellow and red.Each detonation will be accompaniedby a sudden burst of acceleration.Hopefully we'll hit  miles per hourbefore the needle gets much past ,.Why? What happens after it hits ,?The whole boiler explodes!Perfect!We just hit !Okay, Marty.I'm coming aboard!Emmett!Come on.You better hold onto something!The yellow log is about to blow!Golly.We just passed !Emmett!We just passed ! Go for it!Fifty.Emmett!Clara!I love you!What's happening?It's Clara! She's on the train!Clara? Perfect.She's in the cab! I'm going back for her!The windmill!Doc! We're going past ! You'll never make it!Then we'll have to take her back with us!Keep calling out the speed!Clara, climb out here to me!I don't know if I can!You can do it!Just don't look down!That's it!Sixty miles an hour!You're doing fine! Nice and steady!Come on!Just a little further!I can't! I'm scared!Seventy!Keep coming, Clara!Come on! You're doing fine!Come on! Nice and easy!Don't look down! That's it! You're doing fine!The red log is about to blow!Clara!Emmett!I'm trying to reach you!Clara, hold on!I can't!I'll slip you the Hoverboard!Marty, watch out!Emmett, help!Hold on!Ready, Doc?Catch it!Yes!Emmett!Clara!Well, Doc......it's destroyed.Just like you wanted.Hey, butthead, get away...Watch it, Biff!I didn't mean to scare you.I didn't recognize you.What the hell are you doing?Just putting on the second coat.You going cowboy?Come on, guys. We'll be late for brunch.Dad, they won't hold your reservations all day.I can't find my glasses.Have you seen them?They're in your suede jacket.Marty? What's wrong?We thought you went to the lake.You wore that to the lake?Thank God you guys are back to normal.Who are you supposed to be? Clint Eastwood?Right. I have to go get Jennifer.I really like that hat.Thanks, Biff.Jennifer.Jen.Jennifer.Marty.Marty!I had the worst nightmare.That dream I had is so real.It was about the future.About us.And you got fired.Wait a minute.What do you mean, I got fired?Hilldale.Hilldale! This is where we live.I mean, this is where we're going to live.Someday.It was a dream, wasn't it?The big M.How's it hanging, McFly?Hey, Needles.Nice set of wheels.Let's see what she can do.Next green light.No, thanks.What's the matter? Chicken?Marty, don't.Grab hold of something.Come on!Get on!Yeah, go!Did you do that on purpose?Yeah. You think I'm stupid enoughto race that asshole?Jeez! I would have hit that RollsRoyce.It erased.You're right. There's not much left.Doc's never coming back.I'll sure miss him, Jen.What the hell?Doc!Marty!Doc!Marty!It runs on steam!Meet the family. Clara, you know.Hi, Marty!Ma'am!These are our boys:Jules and Verne.Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.Doc, I thought I'd never see you again.You can't keep a good scientist down.I had to come back for Einstein......and I didn't want you to be worried about me.I brought you a little souvenir.It's great, Doc.Thanks.Dr. Brown, I brought this noteback from the future......and now it's erased.Of course it's erased.What does that mean?It means your future hasn't been written yet.No one's has.Your future is whatever you make it.So make it a good one, both of you.We will, Doc!Stand back!All right, boys, buckle up!Where are you going now? Back to the future?No. Already been there.Subtitles By Rajanee"

You know me.And the weight of the logsnapped the limb of the tree.So I... I couldn't even kill myselfthe way I wanted to.I had power over nothing.And that's when this feeling cameover me like a warm blanket.I knew, somehow...that I had to stay alive.Somehow.I had to keep breathing,even though there was no reasonto hope.And all my logic said that I wouldnever see this place again.So that's what I did.I stayed alive.I kept breathing.Then one daythat logic was proven all wrong,because the tide came in,gave me a sail.And now, here I am.I'm back...in Memphis,talking to you.I have ice in my glass.And I've lost her all over again.I'm so sad that I don't have Kelly.But I'm so grateful thatshe was with me on that island.And I know what I have to do now.I gotta keep breathing.Because tomorrow, the sun will rise.Who knows what the tide could bring?# I gave a letter to the postman# He put it in his sack# Bright and early next mornin'# He brought my letter back# She wrote upon it# Return to sender# Address unknown# No such number... #Hello!Hello!(Whistles )FedEx!You look lost.I do?Where are you headed?Well, I was just aboutto figure that out.Well, that's  South.And this road herewill hook you up with I East.If you turn right,that'll take you toAmarillo, Flagstaff,California.And if you head back that direction,you'll find a whole lotta nothin'all the way to Canada.I got it.All right, then.Good luck, cowboy.Thank you."

Alice in Wonderland,2010,"Charles, you havefinally lost your senses.This venture is impossible.For some. Gentlemen, the only wayto achieve the impossibleis to believe it is possible.That kind of thinking could ruin you.I'm willing to take that chance.Imagine trading postsin Rangoon, Bangkok, Jakarta...The nightmare again?I won't be long.I'm falling down a dark hole,then I see strange creatures.What kind of creatures?Well, there's a dodo bird,a rabbit in a waistcoat, a smiling cat.I didn't know cats could smile.Neither did I.And there's a blue caterpillar.Blue caterpillar.Hmm.Do you think I've gone round the bend?I'm afraid so.You're mad, bonkers, off your head.But I'll tell you a secret.All the best people are.It's only a dream, Alice.Nothing can harm you there.But if you get too frightened,you can always wake up. Like this.Ow!Must we go?Doubt they'll notice if we never arrive.They will notice.Where's your corset?And no stockings.I'm against them.But you're not properly dressed.Who's to say what is proper?What if it was agreed that ""proper""was wearing a codfish on your head? Would you wear it? Alice.To me, a corset is like a codfish.Please, not today.Father would have laughed.I'm sorry. I'm tired.I didn't sleep well last night.Did you have bad dreams again?Only one.It's always the same,ever since I can remember.Do you think that's normal?Don't most peoplehave different dreams?I don't know.There. You're beautiful.Now, can you manage a smile?At last. We thought you'd never arrive.Alice, Hamish is waitingto dance with you. Go.You do realize it's well past :.Now everything will haveto be rushed through. I am sorry. Oh, never mind!Forgive my wife. She's been planningthis affair for over  years.If only Charles were here...My condolences.I think of your husband often.He was truly a man of vision.I hope you don't think I've takenadvantage of your misfortunes.Of course not. I'm pleasedthat you purchased the company.I was a fool for not investing inhis mad venture when I had the chance.Charles thought so, too.Hamish, do you ever tire of quadrille?On the contrary. I find it invigorating.Do I amuse you?No.I had a sudden visionof all the ladies in trousersand the men wearing dresses.I think you'll do bestto keep your visions to yourself.When in doubt, remain silent.Pardon us, sir.Miss Kingsleigh is distracted today.Where's your head?I was wonderingwhat it would be like to fly.Why would you spend your timethinking aboutsuch an impossible thing?Why wouldn't I?My father said he sometimes believedin six impossible thingsbefore breakfast.Come along.Alice, meet me under the gazeboin precisely  minutes.We have a secret to tell you.If you're telling me,then it's not much of a secret. Perhaps we shouldn't. We decided we should.If we tell her, she won't be surprised. Will you be surprised? Not if you tell me.But now you've brought it up,you have to. No, we don't. In fact, we won't.I wonder if your mother knowsthat you two swim nakedin the Havershims' pond. You wouldn't. Oh, but I would.There's your mother right now.Hamish is going to ask for your hand.You've ruined the surprise!I could strangle them!Everyone went to so much effortto keep the secret.Does everyone know?It's why they've all come.This is your engagement party.Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.When you say yes...But I don't knowif I want to marry Hamish.Who, then?You won't do better than a lord.You'll soon be , Alice.That pretty face won't last forever.You don't want to end uplike Aunt Imogene.And you don't want to be a burdenon Mother, do you?No.So you'll marry Hamish.You will be as happyas I am with Lowell,and your life will be perfect.It's already decided.Alice, dear.I'll leave you to it.Shall we take a leisurely strollthrough the garden, just you and me?Do you know what I've always dreaded?The decline of the aristocracy?Ugly grandchildren. But you're lovely.You're bound to producelittle... Imbeciles!The gardeners haveplanted white roseswhen I specifically asked for red.You could always paint the roses red.What an odd thing to say.You should know that my sonhas extremely delicate digestion. Did you see that? See what? It was a rabbit, I think. Nasty things.I do enjoy setting the dogs on them.If you serve Hamish the wrong foods,he could get a blockage.Did you see it that time? See what? The rabbit.Don't shout.Now, pay attention.Hamish said you were easily distracted. What was I saying? Hamish has a blockage.I couldn't be more interested,but you'll have to excuse me.Aunt Imogene.I think I'm going mad.I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat.I can't be botheredwith your fancy rabbit now.I'm waiting for my fiancé. You have a fiancé? Hmm.There! Did you see it?He's a prince.But, alas, he cannot marry meunless he renounces his throne.It's tragic, isn't it?Very.Lowell?Alice. We were just...Hattie's an old friend.I can see you're very close.Look, you won't mention thisto your sister, will you?I don't know. I'm confused.I need time to think.Well, think about Margaret.She'd never trust me again.You don't want to ruin her marriage,do you?Me?But I'm not the one who'ssneaking around behind her back.There you are.Alice Kingsleigh...Hamish.What is it?You have a caterpillaron your shoulder.Ew.Don't hurt it.You'll want to wash that finger.Alice Kingsleigh,will you be my wife?Well,everyone expects me to,and you're a lord.My face won't last,and I don't want to end up like...But this is happening so quickly. I...I think I...I think I...I need a moment.Hello.It's only a dream.You'd think she wouldremember all this from the first time.You've brought the wrong Alice.McTWISP: No, she's the right one.I'm certain of it.She's the wrong Alice.McTWISP: Give her a chance.Curiouser and curiouser.I told you she's the right Alice.I am not convinced.McTWISP: How is that for gratitude?I've been up there for weeks,trailing one Alice after the next,and I was almost eatenby other animals.Can you imagine?They go about entirely unclothed,and they do their shukm in public. I had to avert my eyes. Doesn't look anything like herself.That's because she's the wrong Alice. If she was, she might be. If she isn't, she ain't. But if she were so, she would be. But she isn't, nohow.How can I be the wrong Alicewhen this is my dream?And who are you, if I might ask?Oh, I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,he's Tweedledee.We should consult Absolem.Exactly. Absolem will know who she is. I'll escort you. Hey, it's not being your turn.So unfair. Hey, leave off! Let go! Are they always this way? Family trait.You can both escort her. Who is this Absolem? He's wise. He's absolute.He's Absolem.Who are you?Absolem?You're not Absolem, I'm Absolem.The question is, who are you?Alice.We shall see.What do you mean by that?I ought to know who I am.Yes, you ought, stupid girl.Unroll the Oraculum.The Oraculum, being a calendricalcompendium of Underland. It's a calendar. Compendium.It tells of each and every daysince the Beginning.Today is Griblig Dayin the time of the Red Queen.Show her the Frabjous Day.Mmm. Yeah, Frabjous being the dayyou slay the Jabberwocky.Sorry? Slay a what?Oh, yeah.

I told you. McTWISP:  Oh, dear. I said so. I said so.Contrariwise,you said she might be.No, you said she would be if she was.Little impostor. Pretendingto be Alice. She should be ashamed.I was so certain of you.I'm sorry.I don't mean to be the wrong Alice.Wait, this is my dream.I'm going to wake up nowand you'll all disappear.That's odd.Pinching usually does the trick.I could stick you, if that would help. It might, actually. Thank you. My pleasure.Ow! Bandersnatch! Bandersnatch!Wait.It's only a dream. Nothing can hurt me.What's she doing?Can't hurt me.

Find her!Find the scent of human girland earn your freedom.For my wife and pups, as well?Everyone will go home.Dogs will believe anything.It looks like you ran afoul of somethingwith wicked claws.And I'm still dreaming.What did that to you? Banner or Bander... The Bandersnatch?Well, I'd better have a look.What are you doing?It needs to be purifiedby someone with evaporating skills,or it will fester and putrefy.I'd rather you didn't.I'll be fine as soon as I wake up.At least let me bind it for you. What do you call yourself? Alice.The Alice? There's been some debate about that. I never get involved in politics.You'd best be on your way.What way? All I want to do iswake up from this dream.Fine.Then I'll take you to the Hareand the Hatter, but that's the end of it.Coming?Watch what you're doing!Hey, watch it!Okay, okay. All right.It's you.No, it's not.McTwisp brought us the wrong Alice.It's the wrong Alice!It's absolutely Alice.You're absolutely Alice.I'd know you anywhere.I'd know him anywhere.Well, as you can see,we're still having tea.And it's all because I was obligedto kill Time waiting for your return.You're terribly late, you know.

Another.Oh!I don't wish to alarm you,but it smells as thoughyou might have dropped something.Never mind him, he's mad.Come along.Stayne!I suppose this makes us even now.Um forced herself on me.I told her my heart belongs to you,but she's obsessed with me.Off with her head!Stand back, Mallymkun.How's this for muchness?No, no!It mustn't be used for anything...Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction!Hatter! Take it to the White Queen. I'm not leaving without you.Go!Run, Alice!Alice?Run!Seize her.Alice.Of course. Why didn't I see it?Well, it has been a long time,and you were such a little tyke then. Give me the sword. Stay back.The Queen will be so pleased.She will take great pleasurein taking off your head. Oh, Alice! Bayard! To Marmoreal.Majesty, Alice has escapedon the Bandersnatch,with the Vorpal sword.How could you let this happen?I may have underestimated her,but we have her conspirators,the Hatter and a dormouse.Off with their heads!Welcome to Marmoreal.I believe this belongs to you.Mmm.The Vorpal sword is home again.The armor is complete.Now all we need is a champion.You're a little tallerthan I thought you'd be.Blame it on too much upelkuchen.Oh.Come with me.Is the March Hare here?You're latefor your soup, you wee besom. You're late for your soup. Could use some salt.Come here, you!Give me that here.Choppy, chop, chop, chop.Leek and potato. Yes. That would be...Pishsalver. Let me think.A pinch of worm fat,urine of the horsefly,buttered fingers.My sister preferred to studyDominion Over Living Things.Tell me, how does she seem to you?Perfectly horrid. And her head? Bulbous.I think she may havesome kind of growth in there,something pressing on her brain.Three coins from a dead man's pocket,two teaspoons of wishful thinking.You can't imagine the thingsthat go on in that place.Oh, yes, I can.But when a champion steps forthto slay the Jabberwocky,the people will rise against her.That should do it.Blow. Feel better? Much, thank you.There's someone herewho would like to speak with you. Absolem? Who are you?I thought we'd settled this.I'm Alice, but not that one. How do you know? You said so yourself.I said you were not hardly Alice,but you're much more her now.In fact, you're almost Alice.Even so,I couldn't slay the Jabberwockyif my life depended on it.It will.So I suggestyou keep the Vorpal sword on handwhen the Frabjous Day arrives.You seem so real.Sometimes I forgetthat this is all a dream.Will you stop doing that?I've always admired that hat.Hello, Chess.Since you won't be needing itanymore,would you considerbequeathing it to me?How dare you?It is a formal execution.I would like to look my best, you know.It is a pity about all this.I was looking forwardto seeing you Futterwacken.I was rather good at it, was I not?I really do love that hat.I would wear itto all the finest occasions.I love a morning execution, don't you? Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, Your Majesty. I'd like to keep it on. Suit yourself.As long as I can get at your neck.I'm right behind you.Off with his head!I can't watch.Good morning, everyone.Chess, you dog.Madam,you are being heinously bamboozledby these lickspittle toadiesyou surround yourselves with.What is that?I'm not the only one, Majesty. Look!A counterfeit nose.You should be ashamed.Me? What about that big bellyyou're so proud of?Liars! Cheats! Falsifiers!Off with their heads!The abused and enslavedin the Red Queen's court,all of you stand up and fight!Rise up against the bloody Red Queen. Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid! Downal wyth Bluddy Behg Hid!Release the Jubjub Bird!You're right, Stayne,it is far better to be feared than loved.Come, boys. Quickly! Come on!Hatter!Come on, Mally, quickly.Come on. Come on.Prepare the Jabberwocky for battle.We're going to visit my little sister.I had hopedto have a champion by now.Why don't you slaythe Jabberwocky yourself?You must have the power.It is against my vowsto harm any living creature.We have company.Have a look, Bayard.Bielle.I'm so happy to see you.I thought they were going to...So did I. But they didn't,and now here I am, still in one piece.And I'm rather glad about thatnow that I'm seeing you again.I would have regrettednot seeing you again,especially now that you're you,and the proper size.And it's a good size. It's a great size.It's a right proper Alice size! Hatter. Size. Fez. I'm fine.Where's your hat?Mmm. Cheshire. How's the arm, love?All healed.Goodbye, sweet hat.Have you any ideawhy a raven is like a writing desk?Let me think about it.You know what tomorrow is, don't you?Frabjous Day. How could I forget?Wish I'd wake up. Still believe this is a dream, do you? Of course.This has all come from my own mind.Which would mean that I'm not real.Afraid so.You're just a figment of my imagination.I would dream up someonewho's halfmad.Yes, yes. But you would have to behalfmad to dream me up.I must be, then.I'll miss you when I wake up.Who will step forth to be championfor the White Queen?That would be I.You have very poor evaporating skills.I should be the one.I'll do it. No, me. No, me.No other slayer, nohow.If it ain't Alice, it ain't dead.Alice, you cannot live your lifeto please others.The choice must be yours,because when you step outto face that creature,you will step out alone.Nothing was ever accomplishedwith tears.Absolem?Why are you upside down?I've come to the end of this life. You're going to die? Transform.Don't go. I need your help.I don't know what to do.I can't help you if you don't even knowwho you are, stupid girl.I'm not stupid.My name is Alice. I live in London.I have a mother named Helenand a sister named Margaret.My father was Charles Kingsleigh.He had a vision that stretchedhalfway around the world,and nothing ever stopped him.I'm his daughter. I'm Alice Kingsleigh.Alice, at last.You were just as dimwittedthe first time you were here.You called it ""Wonderland,"" as I recall.Wonderland. What do you call yourself? Alice.The Alice?Then I'll take you to the Hareand the Hatter, but that's the end of it.McTWISP: She's the right one.I'm certain of it.Ah, Thackery, not at the table, please.Have some tea.You're not Absolem,I'm Absolem, stupid girl. What is this? I'm Tweedledee, he's Tweedledum.Contrariwise, I'm Tweedledum,he's Tweedledee.You'd think she wouldremember all this from the first time.Curiouser and curiouser.It wasn't a dream at all,it was a memory.This place is real,and so are you and so is the Hatter.And the Jabberwocky.Remember, the Vorpal swordknows what it wants.All you have to do is hold on to it.Fairfarren, Alice.Perhaps I will see you in another life. Hello, Iracebeth. Hello, Mirana.On this, the Frabjous Day,the Queens Red and Whiteshall send forth their championsto do battle on their behalf.Oh, Racie. We don't have to fight.I know what you're doing.You think you can blinkthose pretty little eyesand I'll melt,just like Mummy and Daddy did.Please.No! It is my crown! I am the eldest!Jabberwocky!This is impossible.Only if you believe it is.Sometimes I believe as many as siximpossible things before breakfast.That is an excellent practice.However, just at the moment,you really might wantto focus on the Jabberwocky.Where's your champion, Sister?Here.Hello, Um.Six impossible things.Count them, Alice.One, there's a potionthat can make you shrink.Two, and a cakethat can make you grow.So, my old foe,we meet on the battlefield once again.We've never met.Not you, insignificant bearer.My ancient enemy, the Vorpal one.That's enough chatter.Three, animals can talk.Four, Alice,cats can disappear.Five,there's a place called Wonderland.Six,I can slay the Jabberwocky.The Hatter's interfering!Off with his head!Off with your head!Kill her!We follow you no more,Bloody Big Head.How dare you? Off with his head!Iracebeth of Crims, your crimesagainst Underland are worthy of death.However, that is against my vows,therefore, you are banishedto the Outlands.No one is to show you any kindness,or ever speak a word to you.You will not have a friend in the world.Majesty, I hope you bear me no ill will.Only this one, Ilosovic Stayne,you are to join Iracebeth in banishmentfrom this dayuntil the end of Underland.At least we have each other.Majesty, please! Kill me! Please!But I do not owe you a kindness. Take off my head! He tried to kill me. Majesty! Please! Please! He tried to kill me. I offer you my head! He tried to kill me!Oh, the Frabjous Day! Callou! Callay! What is he doing? Futterwacken.Blood of the Jabberwocky.You have our everlasting gratitude.And for your efforts on our behalf... Will this take me home? If that is what you choose.You could stay.What an idea.A crazy, mad, wonderful idea.But I can't.There are questions I have to answer,things I have to do.Be back again before you know it.You won't remember me.Of course I will. How could I forget?Hatter, why is a ravenlike a writing desk?I haven't the slightest idea.Fairfarren, Alice.She left me standing therewithout an answer.A case of nerves, no doubt. Alice. Good Lord. Are you all right? What happened to you?I fell down a hole and hit my head.I'm sorry, Hamish. I can't marry you.You're not the right man for me.And there's that troublewith your digestion.I love you, Margaret, but this is my life.I'll decide what to do with it.You're lucky to have my sisterfor your wife, Lowell,and you be good to her.I'll be watching very closely.There is no prince, Aunt Imogene.You need to talk to someoneabout these delusions.I happen to love rabbits,especially white ones.Don't worry, Mother,I'll find something usefulto do with my life.You two remind me of some funny boysI met in a dream.

And one more thing.My father told me he planned to expandhis trade route to Sumatra and Borneo,but I don't thinkhe was looking far enough.Why not go all the way to China?It's vast, the culture is rich,and we have a foothold in Hong Kong.To be the first to trade with China,can you imagine it?You know, if anybody elsehad said that to me,I'd say, ""You've lost your senses"".But I've seen that look before.Well, as you're not going to bemy daughterinlaw,perhaps you'd consider becomingan apprentice with the company.Hello, Absolem.Tripping out, spinning aroundI'm undergroundI fell downYeah, I fell downI'm freaking outWhere am I now?Upside down and I can't stop it nowCan't stop me nowI, I'll get byI, I'll surviveWhen the world's crashing downWhen I fall and hit the groundI will turn myself aroundDon't you try to stop meI, I won't cryI found myself in WonderlandGet back on my feet, the groundIs this real?Is it pretend?I'll take a stand until the endI, I'll get byI, I'll surviveWhen the world's crashing downWhen I fall and hit the groundI will turn myself aroundDon't you try to stop meI, I won't cryOh, Alice, dear, where have you been?So near, so far, so in betweenWhat have you heard?What have you seen?Alice, Alice, please, AliceOh, tell us, are you big or small?To try this one or try them allIt's such a long, long way to fallAlice, Alice, oh, AliceHow can you know this way, not that?You choose the doorYou choose the pathPerhaps you should be coming backAnother day, another dayAnd nothing is quite what it seemsYou're dreamingAre you dreaming?Oh, AliceOh, AliceOh!Oh, how will you find your way?Oh, how will you find your way?No time for tears todayNo time for tears todayNo time for tears todayNo time for tears todaySo many doors, how did you choose?So much to gain, so much to loseSo many things got in your wayNo time today, no time todayBe careful not to lose your headRemember what the dormouse saidAlice!Did someone pull you by the hand?How many miles to Wonderland?Please tell us so we'll understandAlice, Alice, oh, AliceOh, how will you find your way?Oh, how will you find your way?"

Goodbye, Gru.Now, I know there have beensome rumors going aroundthat the bankis no longer funding us.Well, I am hereto put those rumors to rest.They are true.In terms of money,we have no money.So how will we get to the moon?The answer is clear.We won't.We are doomed.Now would probably be a good timeto look for other employment options.I know.I have fired up my resumeas I suggestthat all of you do, as well.What is it?Can't you see that I amin the middle of a pep talk?Yes!Yes, we will build our own rocketusing this and whatever elsewe can find!Grab everything!

Hold still.Okay, seriously! Seriously!This is beddiebye time, right now.I'm not kidding around. I mean it! But we're not tired! Well, I am tired.Will you read us a bedtime story?No.Pretty please!The physical appearance of the ""please""makes no difference.It is still no, so go to sleep.But we can't.

The train's leaving!Are the police still around?We'll have to go even if they are.I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!Hey, idiot!We should go, too!Hey, don't leave me behind!WWait up!Tanjiro! Inosuke!Zenitsu!So fast!Sorry! We're very sorry!Forget that! Get over here, idiot!So freakin' fast!Ma'am, is that all right?Thank you.Sorry to trouble you.Oh no.It's the least I can do.He's a Hashira, right?This Rengoku person...Are you sure you'll recognize his face?Sure.He had this gaudy hairstyle,and I remember his scent, too.Hey!I think I'll know it's him once we get close.Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Delicious!Is that the Flame Hashira guy? Delicious! Yeah.Not just some random glutton? Delicious! Yeah.Delicious!Um, excuse me...Delicious!RRengoku?Delicious!Uh, we really get that part already.And you're the kidfrom that day at the Master's.Yes.I'm Tanjiro Kamado.And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.I see. And inside that box there...Yes.It's my sister Nezuko.Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?Since the Master's acknowledged her,I won't say any word for now.Have a seat here.Being inside the lord is mindblowing!You're going to break the glass!Calm down already, will ya?What are you three doing here?A mission?We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.""The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.Join Rengoku on site,"" he said.Yes! I see now! Understood!Right.Also, there's one more thing.Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.What is it? Let's hear it.About my father...What about your father?Well, he was really frail.Was he really?But even if it was cold enoughto freeze your lungs,he could still performa kagura dance in the snow.Well, I'm glad to hear it!The thing is...What's up?Hinokami Kagura...Dance!I suddenly found myself doing the kagurathat I'd seen as a child.If you know anything about that, Rengoku...I was hoping you'd tell me.Right!But I know nothing!I've never even heardthe term ""Hinokami Dance"" before.But it's truly commendable that your fatherwas able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.All right, end of discussion!Um, can you try to help me a little more?You should become my Tsuguko,my apprentice! I'll look after you!Hold on a second!And just what are you looking at?He's totally weird, all right.Flame Breathing has a long history.In any given era, there's always been a Flameand Water swordsman among the Hashira.Flame.Water.Wind.Stone.Thunder. Those are the fundamentalbreathing techniques.The other techniques were createdas offshoots of those five.Mist is a fork of Wind.Young Mizoguchi!What color is your sword?My name's Kamado.And the color is black.A black sword, huh?Well, isn't that unfortunate?For real?I've never known a swordsmanwith a black sword that became a Hashira.On top of that, I hear that they haveno clue which style to master.Come to me, and I'll train you!You can rest easy now!No, thank you!And just what are you looking at?He's strange,but he seems to be very caring.And from his scent,I can pick up his strong sense of justice.Awesome! Awesome! So fast!That's dangerous, you idiot!I'm gonna run outsideand race to see who's faster! You can't possibly be that stupid, can you? That's dangerous.You never know when a demon might appear.You're kidding, right?Demons show up on this train?Sure do!What? They do?Nooo! So, we're not headingto where the demons are, but we're here?Nooo!I'm getting off!Over  people have disappeared on this train.The Corps sent a few swordsmen,but then they all went silent.That's why I, a Hashira, am here.Right, I see!I'm getting off! I'm getting off!May I...see your...tickets, please?What's he doing?The conductor's going to checkyour ticket and punch a hole in it.Here.What is this?There's a horrible scent.Thank you...very much.Mr. Conductor...You could get hurt,so please step back.As this is an emergency,please overlook the fact that I have a sword.Was it a Blood Demon Artthat hid that massive body?I had a hard time detecting you.But if you bare your fangsat innocent people...my bright red Flame Bladewill burn you to the bone!Flame Breathing...First Form...Unknowing Fire!Amazing.He sliced off the demon's headwith one blow.There's still one more.Come with me!All right!DDon't leave me behind!You will not lay a finger on that man!Didn't you hear me?I said I'm your opponent.What the hell is it? It's got long arms!All right! First come, first served! Hold up!We gotta save the passenger first!It won't matteronce I destroy that thing!You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.We're good to go now.Let's finish him off in short order.Flame Breathing...Second Form...Rising Scorching Sun!Tha...Tha...That was awesome, Bro!Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!Please make me your apprentice!Fine by me! I'll makea fine swordsman out of you! Me, too, please! Me, three!I'll train all of you!Big Bro Rengoku!Bro! Bro! Bro!Big Bro Rengoku!I did as I was told! I punchedtheir tickets and put them to sleep!Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!Please let me be reunitedwith my dead wife and daughter!I'm begging you.I'm begging you.Sure thing.You did a good job.Go to sleep.Have a nice dreamwhere you can meet your family.Excuse me.What do you want us to do?Their slumber will grow deeperin a little while.Wait here until then.Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake upsensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.When you tie the ropes,be careful not to touch their bodies.I will have to stay in the first car for a while.Hang on until everything's ready to go...so that you can have blissful dreams.Okay.What's going on? What happened?Calm down.Calm down.You have to calm down.Hey!It's Big Bro!Welcome home, Big Bro!Did you sell the charcoal?Big Bro?I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!To be able to die while dreaming...Just how lucky are you?It doesn't matter how powerfula Demon Slayer you are.A human's driving forceis the heart, the spirit!All you have to dois destroy the spiritual core.You can kill them just like that!All human hearts are the same.So fragile and weak, like glasswork.Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?That's right. Don't forgetwhat he warned us about.Take a deep, slow breath...while you count.Do that, and you'll fall asleep.One...Two...Three...Four...Five...Six...And then, we were surprisedbecause Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!What a weirdo!Oh my, you must be exhausted.It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.You don't have a fever, do you?Take it easy and get some rest today, okay?I'm all right.Are you sure?Hey! You come back here!Gotcha!What do you think you're doing?Hey! You stop that right now!Seems like...I was having a bad dream or something.Falling deeper into sleep,deep in their dreams...Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...And even if a demon comes,deep in their dreams...Even in the stomach,deep in their dreams...Looks like fun.You're starting to havea happy dream, aren't you?You are falling...You are falling...into a dream.It's a deep slumber.They can...no longer awaken.This way!The peaches over here taste great!And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!I'll make you a chaplet!I can make these really greatlooking ones...Nezuko!Yes! Make a lot, okay...Zenitsu?There's a river along the way,but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?River?What am I going to do, Zenitsu?I can't swim.II'll just carry you on my backand jump right over the river!Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!Just leave it to me!Let's go!Expedition Team! Expedition Team!We're the Cave Expedition Team!Expedition Team! Expedition Team!We're the Cave Expedition Team!Expedition Team! Expedition Team!Boss!Boss!What's up, Underling  and Underling ?I can smell the master of this caveover there, pompoko!And I can hear it breathingas it sleeps, squeak!Here he is!All right, let's go! Showdown! Roger that, Boss! Roger that, Boss!Hey you! Come with me, Underling !Come over here! Look, I'll give youthese sparkly acorns! C'mon!Let's go! Hey! Hey!Why did I come here?Oh, right.To report to my father...that I've become a Hashira.So what if you've become a Hashira?Worthless.It means nothing.You're never going to amountto anything anyway.Neither you...nor I.Brother...Was our father pleased to hear your news?Do you think our father will acknowledge meif I become a Hashira, too?He wasn't always like that.After all, he did rise to the rankof Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps.He was a passionate man.And yet, one day, out of the blue,he quit being a swordsman.Suddenly.The man who'd raised us bothwith such enthusiasm...Why?It's pointless to thinkabout such things, so stop.Senjuro is even worse off.He barely has any memories of our motherwho died of illness when he was very young,and just look at the state our father is in.I'm going to be honest.Our father wasn't happy to hear it.He told me that it meant nothing.But that's not enoughto extinguish my passion!This flame inside my heartwill never go out!I'll never give in!And Senjuro...You're not like me.You have a big brother...who believes in his little brother.No matter what path you take,you're going to become a fine human being!Keep that burning passioninside your heart!Let's do our best!Let's do our best and live on!No matter how lonely it gets.Looking good.Those ropes that I created are used...for a special technique that allows one to invadethe dreams of whoever you're tethered to.I always fight with the utmost caution.Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,you're no different than a baby.I'll enjoy the feastafter killing the Demon Slayers.There's no need to swing in such a hurry.Relax your shoulders.Like this?That's right.Close call. He's right there.I have to make sure he doesn't see me!I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!Hurry!The dream world I show them isn't infinite.It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.The realm of the subconscious exists just outsidethe dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.That's what you must destroy.Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.There it is!The scenery doesn't end here,but you can't go any further.I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!And then, I'll get to seea happy dream myself!What an odd realm of the subconscious.It's hot.It's burning up.I have to hurry.Found it!The spiritual core!I've never seen a red one before.All I have to do is destroy this and...It'll be my turn to...I thought humans couldn't movewhile they were under a spell.What a strong survival instinct he has!I'm going to make your favoriterice crackers today, Tanjiro.Wow!I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.It's our lucky day, Rokuta!Rice crackers!No fair! Big Bro's not the only onewho likes rice crackers! I like them, too! Me, too!Then, let's eat them together, okay?Can you get the grill ready for me?Okay!I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!Okay, I'll be in chargeof flipping them over, then!Me, too!Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!No fair!There.Nezuko, let's go.What did I just say?I'm back!Welcome home, Tanjiro.Yeah, I'm home!Welcome home, Big Bro!Huh? Where's Nezuko?Big Sis went up the mountainto pick vegetables.In broad daylight?She's not supposed to?Well...Um...Tanjiro...Could you get the bath ready?I'm going to be busy with this for a while.I keep saying all these strange things.Am I tired maybe?Huh? It's gone.I wonder what that wasfor just a split second.A toolbox perhaps?I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.Wake up!Wake up!Wake up!You're under attack!It's a dream!This is a dream!Wake up now!I see... That's right, I'm...on board the train!Wake up and fight!Fight!Fight!Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!No, you don't! You stop it right now!Why are you alwaystaking food away from Big Bro?What's your problem?You just had seconds!No good! I'm not awake yet!I'm still inside a dream!How can I get out of it?Now that I've realized that it's a dream...What am I supposed to do?I have to wake up...Big Bro! What should we do? The fire is— Big Bro!That's Nezuko's scent!It's Nezuko's blood!Nezuko...Nezuko!My uniform...My Nichirin Sword...I'm waking up!Little by little.Little by little!Big Bro?Big Bro, are you all right?Big Bro?Sorry.I have to go.I have to hurry back!I'm sorry.Big Bro! Big Bro! Big Bro!If the demon who's showing methis dream is nearby...I have to find himand slash him right away!Where is he? I have to...Where are you going, Big Bro?I picked lots of vegetables today!Mom! This way!Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!Mom?Tanjiro, are you all right?Big Bro...What's the matter, Tanjiro?Why are you dressed like that?I wish I could stay here...forever.I wish I could turn around and go back.By rights, I should've been livinglike this forever.Right here.If none of this had happened...they'd all have been alive and well now.And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,under the blue sky.If none of this had happened...If none of this had happened...I should be heremaking charcoal every day.I never would've laid a hand on a sword!If none of this had happened...If none of this had happened...But I've lost them now.I can never go back!Big Bro!Don't leave us behind!Sorry!I'm sorry, Rokuta!We can't be together anymore.But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?I'll be thinking of you all!There are lots of things to thank you for.Lots of things to be sorry for!But I will never forget you!No matter what,my heart will always be with you!So, please...forgive me!I have to destroyhis spiritual core right away.So, this is the inside of his heart?How can it be so beautiful?It's so endlessly vast...and...also warm.Where the heck is his spiritual core?What's with this realmof the subconscious?And that creepy naked boar...Seriously, this is insane.What are you doingin the realm of the subconscious?You stupid naked boar!It's pitchdark.It's pitchdark,and I can't see a thing. Dammit.What's with that blond brat'srealm of subconscious?Do I have to grope aroundto find his spiritual core?You must be kidding me.What was that?What the hell's a guy doing in here?Damn you, parasite!No one's allowed in here but Nezuko.I'm so going to kill you.Where's Nezuko?WhWho the heck knows?All right, then... Die!Nooo!They're having trouble, aren't they?I wonder why.They haven't destroyedany of the spiritual cores yet.Oh well...I guess it doesn't matter,since they're buying me some time.Not here.But I can smell a demon, even faintly.What's this, though?It's like there's a film over everything!There's a faint demon scent everywhere!I can't tell the exact location!I have to hurry!Nezuko's bleeding!If everyone else is asleep,we're in big trouble!What should I do?Am I unable to useTotal Concentration Breathing now?Am I just asleep right now?Tanjiro...Take up your sword.There's something you must cut.There's something...I must cut.There's something I must cut...in order to wake up.I think I know what it is.But what if I'm wrong?If what happens in this dreamhas an effect on reality, too...there'll be no going back.Don't hesitate! Do it!You have to do it!My death in this dreamwill lead me to reality!In other words...what I have to cut is...my own neck!I'm all right. I'm alive.Nezuko! Are you okay?Nezuko...Zenitsu...Inosuke...Rengoku...Who are these people?They're all connectedby the wrists with ropes.Rope...What's this?It's burned off.Nezuko's burning blood did it?It's faint, but I'm picking upa demon's scent, too!This smell... The ticket!I knew it. It's giving offa faint demon smell, too.We were put to sleepwhen our tickets were punched.This must be a demon's work!Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Artusing just this faint scent?I don't know why...but I have a feeling that I shouldn't severthis rope with my Nichirin Sword.Nezuko! Do me a favor!I want you to burn off everyone's rope!Zenitsu! Wake up!Wake up, Zenitsu!You have to wake up!Wake up, Inosuke! Please!Inosuke...There, there... Sorry, okay?Thanks.You did a great job, Nezuko.It's no good. These two don't wake up.What can I do?Rengoku—What are you doing?Is a demon controlling her?Get out of our way!Thanks to you guys,we won't be able to have dreams!Is she acting of her own free will?This man, too?What do you think you're doing?If you're awake,you'd better help us out!You may have tuberculosis or whatever,but if you don't do your job,I'm going to tell him, and then,he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?Is he the onewho was connected to me?Tuberculosis...He's sick.Poor man.What this demon did is unforgivable.He took advantage of their weak souls!Sorry.I have to go fight.You want to stayinside a happy dream, don't you?I know.I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.If only this was the dream...I was willing...to hurt others if it meantI could escape from the pain of this illness.But it was warm...inside your dream and inside your soul.You must be the incarnationsof this boy's soul.The air is so clear, and it feels good.Is that his spiritual core?Why are you showing it to me?Did you bring me herebecause I was searching for it?No way!Even though I was trying to destroy it?Why would you...The shining little spritesinside you lit up my heart.Are you all right?Thank you.Be careful.Right!Nezuko!The smell is overpowering!So heavy!The demon's scent is so strongeven in this strong wind!Was I asleep in such an awful scent?Even if each car was closed off and airtight,I can't believe I was!I was useless!The demon's upwind...Is he in the first car?Nezuko, don't come!Stay away from me and wait!Go wake everyone up!What? You're awake?Good morning!You could've stayed asleep.It was him!Why did you wake up?Didn't I show you a sweet dream?I could've shown you a dreamwhere your family was being slaughtered.Would you have liked that one better?No, of course not.Too distressing, right?All right, next...Why don't I show you a dreamwhere your father comes back to life?What I really love...is to show people nightmaresright after a happy dream.I just adore the sightof a distorted human face.I get such a kick out of that!How enthralling is it to gaze at someoneshattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?But I don't usually let my guard down.So, it may take longer,but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers.I mixed my bloodwith the ink on the tickets.Once the conductor punches them,creating clamp marks...the spell activates.And yet...how did this one manage to wake up?And he found the way to wake up in a short time.Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,for selfserving dreams...is so enormous!Don't you dare intrude on my soul!I won't let you...get away with this!What's that? I see he's wearing earrings.How lucky is that?So, he came right to me!This is like a dream!Now I can receiveeven more blood of Master Muzan!And once I become more powerful,I'll challenge an Upper Rank demonto a duel to replace him!Water Breathing...Tenth Form...Constant Flux!Blood Demon Art!Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.Go to sleep!He's not falling asleep.Go to sleep.Go to sleep.Go to sleep!Go to sleep!Go... to... sleep!It's not working. But why not?No, that's not what this is.He's falling under this spell over and over!He's aware that he's under the spell right away.And he's committing suicidein order to awaken!Even if it's in the middle of a dream,to commit suicide...to take his own life with his own hands...that takes incredible willpower!This brat...is insane!Why didn't you save us?What were you doingwhile we were being murdered?How could you be the only one to survive?Why do you think you were here?You're so useless!It should've been you that died.How dare you go on livingwithout a care.There's no way they'd ever say that!Not ever! Not my family!Don't you dare...insult...my family!It was way too easy.Could this be a dream, too?Or was this demon weaker than him?I can totally see why...he ordered me to kill you,the boy with the earrings,along with the Hashira!Your very existence is, like...It couldn't be more irritating, you know!He's not dying?Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!That's the look I've been wanting to see!You want to know why I'm not deadafter you decapitated me, don't you?Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.It's so easyeven an infant would understand.It's because the body over therewas no longer my main body.Same with this thingthat's talking to you now.It merely looks like my head, but it's not.While you were snoozing away...I fused with this train!Every inch of this train has becomemy blood, my flesh and my bones!Look at your face.Are you getting it now?In other words...the more than  passengerson this train...are the food that will strengthenmy body even more...as well as my hostages.So, do you thinkyou can protect them by yourself?All these people packing this trainfrom one end to another...Can you alone keep mefrom devouring them?What should I do? What should I do?The most I can protect on my own is two cars!Any more than that,and I can't guarantee their safety!Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!This is no time to be sleeping!Wake up, will you?

Am I going to die?Me?Ridiculous.Ridiculous!I haven't been able to go all out!I couldn't devour a single human!My plan to fuse with the train and devourhumans en masse just went up in smoke!And now, look what I've been reduced to!After all the time and trouble I've taken!It was him!It's all his fault!Even though I'd taken humans hostage, still I struggled!I was held at bay!Is this the power of a Hashira?And him... He was fast, too.Even though he never brokethe spell completely!Not to mention that girl!She's a demon! What's that about?A demon, joining forceswith Demon Slayers?Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?Dammit! Dammit!In the first place...it all started going downhillonce that brat broke my spell!That brat is to blame!I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!That's right, and that boar, too!I could've at least killed that brat!But that boar thwarted me.His intuition is extraordinary.He could sense my gaze!Am I going to lose?Am I going to die?Oh, what a nightmare!What a nightmare!It's always the bottomfeeder demonswho get killed by the Demon Slayers.In the Upper Ranks...the same demons have remainedfor the last few centuries.They're strong enough to defeat Hashirawho've killed an untold number of demons.Do they have otherworldly powers?Even after receiving so much of his blood,I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!I want to do it over!I want to do it over!What a miserable nightmare this is...I see you've masteredTotal Concentration, Constant.Impressive!Rengoku...After all, Constant is the first steptoward becoming a Hashira.Although, there might be , stepsbefore you can become a Hashira.I'll do my best.You're bleeding from the abdomen.You have to concentrate harderand improve the precision of your breathing.Make your nerves reachevery corner of your body.There's a blood vessel.A torn blood vessel.Concentrate harder!That's it. Stanch it.Stop the bleeding.Focus!Great! Looks like you stopped it.You'll be able to do all kinds of thingswhen you master breathing.Not that you'll be able to do everything,but you'll become a stronger versionof yourself than yesterday for sure.Right.Everyone's safe!There are hordes of injured people,but no one's life is in danger.Don't strain yourself.Take it easy and rest up.Thank you very much.Upper... Three?What's he doing here and now?Flame Breathing, Second Form...Rising Scorching Sun!That's a fine sword.He sure can regenerate fast.This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...So, this is an Upper Rank.I can't understand why you'd goafter a wounded person first.He could get in the wayof the chitchat... of you and me.What would you and I have to talk about?I'm meeting you now for the first time,but I already dislike you.Is that right?Well, I loathe weak humans, too.The sight of a weaklingmakes my skin crawl.Then, it looks like our senses of valueare completely different.All right, then I havea brilliant proposal for you.Why don't you become a demon, too?I will not.I can tell your strength at a glance.You're a Hashira, aren't you?Your fighting spirithas been honed to the hilt.It's close to the realm of the highest.I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.I'm Akaza.Kyojuro...Let me tell you why you can't enterthe realm of the highest.Because you're a human.Because you're going to grow old.Because you're going to die.Become a demon, Kyojuro.Do that, and you can go on trainingfor a hundred, for two hundred years.You can become stronger.Of all the demons that I've met until now,he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!I have to help him fight!Both growing old and dying are part of the beautyof being an ephemeral creature like a human.The fact that we grow old and dieis what makes human lifeso unbearably precious and noble.""Strength"" isn't a wordused to describe just the body.This boy isn't weak!Don't insult him.I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.You and I have different senses of value.No matter what the reason,I will not become a demon!I see.Technique Development...Destructive Death... Compass Needle!If you refuse to become a demon,I'll kill you.I can't follow their movements!There were never any Flamesamong all the Hashira I've killed until now.And no one ever took me upon my offer, either.Why do you think that is?As a fellow martial artist,I just don't get it.Not when only the chosen onescan become demons!Watching the hideous decline of someoneblessed with extraordinary powers...It pains me! I can't bear it!Die, Kyojuro...while you're still young and strong.Destructive Death...Air Type!I see.Flame Breathing...Fourth Form...Blooming Flame Undulation!When he strikes the air with his fist,the attack will reach me here!He can movefaster than the blink of an eye.If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,slicing his head off will be tricky.In that case...I'll just have to get up close!This superb reaction speed of yours...and these breathtaking sword skillswill be lost, too...Kyojuro!Doesn't that make you sad?It happens to everyone!It's a fact of life for any human!Stay where you are!If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!Stand back! That's an order!Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!Come on, give me your best shot!Concentrate on me.Nice moves!Rengoku!Ol' Goggleeyes!Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.Fight me foreverand get stronger together with me.You have what it takes to do that!I'll pass!Let me repeat it. I don't like you!I will not become a demon!Flame Breathing...Third Form...Blazing Universe!Magnificent! That's sensational!Destructive Death...Air Type!There's no opening.I can't jump in.I can't keep upwith the speed of their movements!Those two are in a different dimension!Getting between them would only mean death!I can feel it in my bones!I can't move...because I know that even if I jumped into back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!Rengoku...You still don't get it?That if you continue attacking,you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?Flame Breathing, First Form...Unknowing Fire!It would be a shame to kill you now!You haven't reachedyour physical peak yet!Second Form...Rising Scorching Sun!In a year or two, you'll have polished your skillseven more, and you'll have greater precision!Third Form...Blazing Universe!Fourth Form...Blooming Flame Undulation!Destructive Death...Fifth Form...Flame Tiger!Disorder!Kyojuro!Did he do it? Did he win?Don't tell me...No way!Let's fight more.Don't die on me, Kyojuro.Rengoku...Rengoku!Rengoku!Even if you fight to death,you can't win, Kyojuro.Those impressive slashes you inflicted on mehave already healed completely.But what about you?A smashed left eye, shattered ribsand damaged internal organs...All irreparable.If you were a demon,you'd heal in a blink of an eye.Those would be mere scratchesfor a demon.You can struggle all you want,but a human can never beat a demon.I want to go help him!But there's no strength in my arms or legs.It's partly because of my injury,but this always happens after I usethe Hinokami Kagura technique!Kyojuro, why...I...I will fulfill my duty!I will not allow anyone here to die!I'll damage his bodyas much as I can in an instant!Flame Breathing...Esoteric Art!What a tremendous fighting spirit!Amazing aura despite all those injuries!That mental strength!That airtight stance!You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!Let's fight each other for all eternity!Set your heart ablaze.Go beyond your limits!I'm the Flame Hashira...Kyojuro Rengoku!Ninth Form...Rengoku!Destructive Death...Annihilation Type!Rengoku!Rengoku!Rengoku!I see hi—Ren...goku...You'll die! This will kill you, Kyojuro!Become a demon!Say that you'll become a demon!You are...strong and one of the chosen ones!Kyojuro...Yes, Mother?I want you to think hard...about what I'm about to ask you.Do you know why you were bornstronger than others?I don't know!So that you can save weaker people.Those who were bornblessed with more gifts than othersare obligated to use those giftsfor the world and other people.You must never use that Godgiven strengthto hurt others or for personal gain.It is the duty of those born strongto help the weak.It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.Make sure you never forget that.I won't!I don't have much more time to live.I was blessed to be the motherof such a strong and gentle child.I will entrust everything to you.Mother...It was an honor for meto have been born to such a person as you!He stopped it?What unbelievable strength!I've pierced through his solar plexuswith my right arm!Damn!It'll be daybreak soon!I have to kill him and get out of here!I can't...pull my arm out!I won't let you escape!No matter what Rengoku says...I have to...do it right now!I have to slice off the demon's head!Quickly!The sun's coming up!There'll be sunlight here!I have to get away!I have to get away!No way am I ever letting go!Not until I chop off your head!Out of my way!Move, Inosuke!Move your body for Rengoku's sake!Beast Breathing, Fang One...Pierce!I have to find refuge from the sunlight!That took too long!I have to get away from the sun!Don't run away!Don't run away, you coward!Don't run away!What the hell is that brat talking about?Doesn't he have a brain in his head?I'm not running away from you!I'm running away from the sun!And besides,the battle's already been decided!He'll run out of strength and die soon!The Demon Slayer Corps...is always fighting you demons in the darkof the night where you have the advantage!That's right, us flesh and blood humans!Our wounds don't close up that easily!And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!Don't run away, you bastard!You bastard!You coward!Rengoku is way more amazing than you!He's stronger!Rengoku didn't lose!He didn't let anybody die!He fought to the end!He protected them to the end!You're the one who lost!It's Rengoku who won!Stop yelling already.You'll reopen that stomach wound.You're badly injured, too, remember?If you die, young Kamado,it'll mean I'm the loser.Rengoku...Come over here.Let's talk a bit one last time.There's something that I remembered...while I was dreaming.You should go to my parents' home,the Rengoku residence.There should be some notes thereleft by the preceding Flame Hashira.My father read them often,but since I never did,I don't know what's in them.There might be some kind of recordof that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.RRengoku, please don't talk any more.Please stop the bleedingwith a breathing technique!Isn't there a wayto close up your wounds?No.I'll be dead soon.I'm going to tell you all I canwhile I can still talk, so listen, will you?Tell my little brother Senjuro...to follow his heart...and to walk down the paththat he feels is right.Tell my father...that I want him to take care of himself.One more thing.Young Kamado...I believe in your little sister.I accept her as a memberof the Demon Slayer Corps.I saw her bleeding as she protectedthe humans inside the train.Anyone who risks their livesfighting demons to protect humans...is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corpsno matter what anyone else says.Go ahead and live with your head held high!No matter how devastated you may beby your own weakness or uselessness...set your heart ablaze.Grit your teethand look straight ahead.Even if you stop and crouch down,the time won't wait for you...or snuggle you and grieve along with you.Don't feel badthat I'm going to die here.As a Hashira,of course I would shield my juniors.Any other Hashirawould've done the same thing.We never let the young buds get nipped.Young Kamado...Young Boar Head...Yellow Boy...Keep learning and grow.And then,become the next Hashirasupporting the Demon Slayer Corps.I believe in you.I believe in you all.Mother...Do you think I did it right?Did I carry out what I had to do...and my duties?You made me proud.When the train went off the rails,Rengoku had unleashedall these techniques.He must've kept the damageto the cars to a minimum.I guess he did.I can't believe he's gone.I mean, did an Upper Rank demonreally show up?Yeah.Why would an Upper Rank come here?Was it that strong? I mean...Yeah.I'm so frustrated!As soon as I master one thing,I find another thick wall right in front of me...while more powerful peopleare fighting far beyond it.I just can't make it there yet!If I'm still stumbling aroundin a place like this, can I...Can I...ever become like Rengoku?Stop whining already!Stop saying dumbass thingslike, ""Can I or can't I be like him?""He said he believes in you, so just thinkabout how you're going to measure up to that!All living things just go backto the earth when they die!Sobbing or snivelingwon't bring them back!Don't cry even if you have regrets!No matter how patheticor humiliated you feel,you still have to go on living!But you're crying, too.There are tears flooding outfrom that headpiece.I'm not crying!Get over here!We're gonna train!Is that so...Rengoku...So, even Rengoku couldn't beatan Upper Rank demon?I don't believe it.Namu Amida Butsu.I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!I see.So, not one of the  passengerslost their lives?Kyojuro did a great job, then.What a remarkable child.I'm not sad.I don't have much longer to live, either.Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...in the land of the dead.Rengoku...Rengoku...Rengoku!<font color=""#ffff"">Provided by explosiveskull</font>https://twitter.com/kaboomskull"
